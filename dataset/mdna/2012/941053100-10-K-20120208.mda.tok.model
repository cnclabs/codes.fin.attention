item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data included in item of this annual report on form k  our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
industry overview the solid waste industry is a local and highly competitive business  requiring substantial labor and capital resources 
the participants compete for collection accounts primarily on the basis of price and  to a lesser extent  the quality of service  and compete for landfill business on the basis of tipping fees  geographic location and quality of operations 
the solid waste industry has been consolidating and continues to consolidate as a result of a number of factors  including the increasing costs and complexity associated with waste management operations and regulatory compliance 
many small independent operators and municipalities lack the capital resources  management  operating skills and technical expertise necessary to operate effectively in such an environment 
the consolidation trend has caused solid waste companies to operate larger landfills that have complementary collection routes that can use company owned disposal capacity 
controlling the point of transfer from haulers to landfills has become increasingly important as landfills continue to close and disposal capacity moves further from collection markets 
generally  the most profitable industry operators are those companies that are vertically integrated or enter into long term collection contracts 
a vertically integrated operator will benefit from the internalization of waste  which is bringing waste to a company owned landfill  the ability to charge third party haulers tipping fees either at landfills or at transfer stations  and the efficiencies gained by being able to aggregate and process waste at a transfer station prior to landfilling 
executive overview we are an integrated solid waste services company that provides solid waste collection  transfer  disposal and recycling services in mostly exclusive and secondary markets in the us we provide intermodal services for the rail haul movement of cargo and solid waste containers in the pacific northwest through a network of intermodal facilities 
we also treat and dispose of non hazardous waste that is generated in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas primarily at a facility in southwest louisiana 
we seek to avoid highly competitive  large urban markets and instead target markets where we can provide either solid waste services under exclusive arrangements  or markets where we can be integrated and attain high market share 
in markets where waste collection services are provided under exclusive arrangements  or where waste disposal is municipally funded or available at multiple municipal sources  we believe that controlling the waste stream by providing collection services under exclusive arrangements is often more important to our growth and profitability than owning or operating landfills 
operating results revenues in increased to billion from billion in  with approximately two thirds of this growth attributable to acquisitions 
operating margins  net income  capital expenditures  and free cash flow also increased  further strengthening our business and financial profile 
as shown in the table below  internal growth decreased to in  from in pricing increased  due to higher surcharges primarily related to increased fuel prices 
increased landfill revenue primarily associated with higher special waste  or one time projects  offset most of the continuing weakness in collection revenue  which resulted in total volume growth decreasing from flat in to negative in intermodal  recycling and other contributed to internal growth in  a slower rate of growth than the realized in  due primarily to a more moderate rate of increase in recycled commodity prices compared to the unprecedented rate of increases in such commodity prices throughout decreases in recycled commodity values experienced during the fourth quarter of are expected to result in negative internal growth from such revenue in price volume intermodal  recycling and other internal growth 
table of contents in  adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization  a non gaap financial measure refer to page of this report for a definition and reconciliation to operating income  increased to million  from million in as a percentage of revenue  adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization increased from in  to in this percentage point increase was primarily attributable to growth in higher margin revenue components price increases to our customers  higher recycling commodity values and increased disposal volumes  offset by a increase in fuel expense as a percent of revenue due to increased market prices for diesel 
net income attributable to waste connections in increased to million from million in free cash flow net cash provided by operating activities increased to million in  from million in  and capital expenditures increased to million over that period 
free cash flow  a non gaap financial measure refer to page of this report for a definition and reconciliation to net cash provided by operating activities  increased to million in  from million in free cash flow as a percentage of revenues was in  compared to in this increase as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to increased deferred taxes associated with an internal revenue service approved change in our tax method for deducting depreciation expense for certain landfills as well as other tax deductible timing differences associated with depreciation 
return of capital to stockholders in  we returned million to stockholders through a combination of stock repurchases and cash dividends 
we repurchased approximately million shares of common stock at a cost of million during our board of directors also declared dividends totaling million throughout  and increased the quarterly cash dividend by from to per share of common stock in october our board of directors intends to review the quarterly dividend during the fourth quarter of each year  with a long term objective of increasing the amount of the dividend 
we expect the amount of capital we return to stockholders through stock repurchases to vary depending on our financial condition and results of operations  capital structure  the amount of cash we deploy on acquisitions  the market price of our common stock  and overall market conditions 
we cannot assure you as to the amounts or timing of future stock repurchases or dividends 
we have the ability under our senior revolving credit facility to repurchase our common stock and pay dividends provided we maintain specified financial ratios 
capital position we target a leverage ratio  as defined in our credit facility  between x and x of total debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda 
we deployed million during for acquisitions  repurchases of common stock  and dividends 
these cash outlays were primarily funded by borrowings during the year and operating cash flow 
as a result of our strong free cash flow and improved financial performance  our leverage ratio remained below our targeted range at year end despite the large outlay of capital 
critical accounting estimates and assumptions the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements 
as described by the sec  critical accounting estimates and assumptions are those that may be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and that have a material impact on the financial condition or operating performance of a company 
such critical accounting estimates and assumptions are applicable to our reportable segments 
based on this definition  we believe the following are our critical accounting estimates 
insurance liabilities 
we maintain high deductible insurance policies for automobile  general  employer s  environmental and directors and officers liability as well as for employee group health insurance  property insurance and workers compensation 
we carry umbrella policies for certain types of claims to provide excess coverage over the underlying policies and per incident deductibles 
our insurance accruals are based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported and are developed by our management with assistance from our third party actuary and third party claims administrator 
the insurance accruals are influenced by our past claims experience factors  which have a limited history  and by published industry development factors 
if we experience insurance claims or costs above or below our historically evaluated levels  our estimates could be materially affected 
the frequency and amount of claims or incidents could vary significantly over time  which could materially affect our self insurance liabilities 
additionally  the actual costs to settle the self insurance liabilities could materially differ from the original estimates and cause us to incur additional costs in future periods associated with prior year claims 

table of contents income taxes 
we use the liability method to account for income taxes 
accordingly  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
if our judgment and estimates concerning assumptions made in calculating our expected future income tax rates are incorrect  our deferred tax assets and liabilities would change 
based on our net deferred tax liability balance at december   each percentage point change to our expected future income tax rate would change our net deferred tax liability balance and income tax expense by approximately million 
accounting for landfills 
we recognize landfill depletion expense as airspace of a landfill is consumed 
our landfill depletion rates are based on the remaining disposal capacity at our landfills  considering both permitted and probable expansion airspace 
we calculate the net present value of our final capping  closure and post closure commitments by estimating the total obligation in current dollars  inflating the obligation based upon the expected date of the expenditure and discounting the inflated total to its present value using a credit adjusted risk free rate 
any changes in expectations that result in an upward revision to the estimated undiscounted cash flows are treated as a new liability and are inflated and discounted at rates reflecting current market conditions 
any changes in expectations that result in a downward revision or no revision to the estimated undiscounted cash flows result in a liability that is inflated and discounted at rates reflecting the market conditions at the time the cash flows were originally estimated 
this policy results in our final capping  closure and post closure liabilities being recorded in layers 
the resulting final capping  closure and post closure obligation is recorded on the balance sheet along with an offsetting addition to site costs  which is amortized to depletion expense as the remaining landfill airspace is consumed 
interest is accreted on the recorded liability using the corresponding discount rate 
the accounting methods discussed below require us to make certain estimates and assumptions 
changes to these estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
any changes to our estimates are applied prospectively 
landfill development costs 
landfill development costs include the costs of acquisition  construction associated with excavation  liners  site berms  groundwater monitoring wells  gas recovery systems and leachate collection systems 
we estimate the total costs associated with developing each landfill site to its final capacity 
total landfill costs include the development costs associated with expansion airspace 
expansion airspace is described below 
landfill development costs depend on future events and thus actual costs could vary significantly from our estimates 
material differences between estimated and actual development costs may affect our cash flows by increasing our capital expenditures and thus affect our results of operations by increasing our landfill depletion expense 
final capping  closure and post closure obligations 
we accrue for estimated final capping  closure and post closure maintenance obligations at the landfills we own  and four of the five landfills that we operate  but do not own  under life of site agreements 
we could have additional material financial obligations relating to final capping  closure and post closure costs at other disposal facilities that we currently own or operate or that we may own or operate in the future 
at january   we decreased our discount rate assumption for purposes of computing layers for final capping  closure and post closure obligations from to  in order to more accurately reflect our long term cost of borrowing as of the end of our inflation rate assumption was for the years ending december  and significant reductions in our estimates of the remaining lives of our landfills or significant increases in our estimates of the landfill final capping  closure and post closure maintenance costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  changes in regulatory or legislative requirements could increase our costs related to our landfills  resulting in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we own two landfills for which the prior owners are obligated to reimburse us for certain costs we incur for final capping  closure and post closure activities on the portion of the landfill utilized by the prior owners 
we accrue the prior owner s portion of the final capping  closure and post closure obligation within the balance sheet classification of other long term liabilities  and a corresponding receivable from the prior owner in long term other assets 
disposal capacity 
our internal and third party engineers perform surveys at least annually to estimate the remaining disposal capacity at our landfills 
our landfill depletion rates are based on the remaining disposal capacity  considering both permitted and probable expansion airspace  at the landfills that we own and at the landfills that we operate  but do not own  under life of site agreements 
our landfill depletion rate is based on the term of the operating agreement at our operated landfill that has capitalized expenditures 
expansion airspace consists of additional disposal capacity being pursued through means of expansion that is not actually permitted 
expansion airspace that meets the following criteria is included in our estimate of total landfill airspace 
whether the land where the expansion is being sought is contiguous to the current disposal site  and we either own the expansion property or have rights to it under an option  purchase  operating or other similar agreement  whether total development costs  final capping costs  and closure post closure costs have been determined  
table of contents whether internal personnel have performed a financial analysis of the proposed expansion site and have determined that it has a positive financial and operational impact  whether internal personnel or external consultants are actively working to obtain the necessary approvals to obtain the landfill expansion permit  and whether we consider it probable that we will achieve the expansion for a pursued expansion to be considered probable  there must be no significant known technical  legal  community  business or political restrictions or similar issues existing that we believe are more likely than not to impair the success of the expansion 
we may be unsuccessful in obtaining permits for expansion disposal capacity at our landfills 
in such cases  we will charge the previously capitalized development costs to expense 
this will adversely affect our operating results and cash flows and could result in greater landfill depletion expense being recognized on a prospective basis 
we periodically evaluate our landfill sites for potential impairment indicators 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on regulatory factors  market conditions and operational performance of our landfills 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that our landfill carrying costs are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible testing 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are tested for impairment on at least an annual basis in the fourth quarter of the year 
in the fourth quarter of  we elected to early adopt the new guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board related to testing goodwill for impairment 
this new guidance provides us the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
in performing the qualitative assessment  we assess relevant events and circumstances that may impact the fair value of our reporting units  including the following macroeconomic conditions  industry and market considerations  cost factors  overall financial performance  company specific events  events affecting a reporting unit  sustained decreases in share price  and recent fair value calculation for our reporting units  if available 
if  after assessing the above described events and circumstances  we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit  which we have determined to be our geographic operating segments  is greater than its carrying value  then no further testing is required 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying value  then we would perform the first step of quantitative testing for goodwill impairment  as described below 
in the first step of quantitative testing for goodwill impairment  we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit and compare the fair value with the carrying value of the net assets assigned to each reporting unit 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit  then no impairment results 
if the fair value is less than its carrying value  then we would perform a second step and determine the fair value of the goodwill 
in this second step  the fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit s identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole  as if that reporting unit had just been acquired and the purchase price were being initially allocated 
if the fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying value for a reporting unit  an impairment charge would be recorded to earnings in our consolidated statements of income 
in testing indefinite lived intangibles for impairment  we compare the estimated fair value of each indefinite lived intangible to its carrying value 
if the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible is less than its carrying value  an impairment charge would be recorded to earnings in our consolidated statements of income 
to determine the fair value of each of our reporting units as a whole and each indefinite lived intangible asset  we use discounted cash flow analyses  which require significant assumptions and estimates about the future operations of each reporting unit and the future discrete cash flows related to each indefinite lived intangible asset 
significant judgments inherent in these analyses include the determination of appropriate discount rates  the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and growth rates 
the cash flows employed in our discounted cash flow analyses were based on ten year financial forecasts  which in turn were based on the annual budget developed internally by management 
these forecasts reflect operating profit margins that were consistent with results and perpetual revenue growth rates of 
our discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of our weighted average cost of capital 
in assessing the reasonableness of our determined fair values of our reporting units  we evaluate our results against our current market capitalization 

table of contents in addition  we would evaluate a reporting unit for impairment if events or circumstances change between annual tests indicating a possible impairment 
examples of such events or circumstances are the same as those described above for the qualitative assessment of goodwill impairment 
we did not record an impairment charge as a result of our qualitative impairment test of goodwill or quantitative impairment test of indefinite lived intangibles in additionally  we do not expect any impairment on our goodwill or indefinite lived intangibles in the foreseeable future 
however  we cannot assure you that goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles will not be impaired at any time in the future 
business combination accounting 
we recognize  separately from goodwill  the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated acquisition date fair values 
we measure and recognize goodwill as of the acquisition date as the excess of a the aggregate of the fair value of consideration transferred  the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree if any and the acquisition date fair value of our previously held equity interest in the acquiree if any  over b the fair value of net assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
from time to time  we consummate acquisitions in which we exchange operations we own for operations owned by another solid waste company 
these exchange transactions require us to estimate the fair market value of either the operations we receive or the operations we dispose of  whichever is more clearly evident 
to the extent that the fair market value of the operations we dispose of differs from the fair market value of the operations we obtain  cash is either paid or received to offset the difference in fair market values 
one method we use to estimate the fair value of solid waste companies is based on a multiple of ebitda 
we determine the appropriate ebitda multiple to be used in the valuation of exchange transactions based on factors such as the size of the transaction  the type and location of markets serviced  the existence of long term contracts and the ebitda multiples we have paid in other similar cash based transactions 
general our solid waste revenues are derived from one industry segment  and consist mainly of fees we charge customers for collection  transfer  recycling and disposal of non hazardous solid waste 
our collection business also generates revenues from the sale of recyclable commodities  which have significant variability 
a large part of our collection revenues comes from providing residential  commercial and industrial services 
we frequently perform these services under service agreements  municipal contracts or franchise agreements with governmental entities 
our existing franchise agreements and most of our existing municipal contracts give us the exclusive right to provide specified waste services in the specified territory during the contract term 
these exclusive arrangements are awarded  at least initially  on a competitive bid basis and subsequently on a bid or negotiated basis 
we also provide residential collection services on a subscription basis with individual households 
we charge transfer station and landfill customers a tipping fee on a per ton and or per yard basis for disposing their solid waste at our transfer stations and landfill facilities 
many of our transfer station and landfill customers have entered into one to ten year disposal contracts with us  most of which provide for annual indexed price increases 
we typically determine the prices of our solid waste services by the collection frequency and level of service  route density  volume  weight and type of waste collected  type of equipment and containers furnished  the distance to the disposal or processing facility  the cost of disposal or processing  and prices charged by competitors for similar services 
the terms of our contracts sometimes limit our ability to pass on price increases 
long term solid waste collection contracts often contain a formula  generally based on a published price index  that automatically adjusts fees to cover increases in some  but not all  operating costs  or that limit increases to less than of the increase in the applicable price index 
our revenues from recycling services consist of selling recyclable materials including cardboard  office paper  plastic containers  glass bottles and ferrous and aluminum metals collected from our residential customers and at our recycling processing operations to third parties for processing before resale 
our revenues from intermodal services consist mainly of fees we charge customers for the movement of cargo and solid waste containers between our intermodal facilities 
we also generate revenue from the storage  maintenance and repair of cargo and solid waste containers and the sale or lease of containers and chassis 

table of contents no single contract or customer accounted for more than of our total revenues at the consolidated or reportable segment level during the periods presented 
the table below shows for the periods indicated our total reported revenues attributable to services provided dollars in thousands 
years ended december  collection disposal and transfer intermodal  recycling and other less intercompany elimination total revenue cost of operations includes labor and benefits  tipping fees paid to third party disposal facilities  vehicle and equipment maintenance  workers compensation  vehicle and equipment insurance  insurance and employee group health claims expense  third party transportation expense  fuel  the cost of materials we purchase for recycling  district and state taxes and host community fees and royalties 
our significant costs of operations in were labor  third party disposal and transportation  vehicle and equipment maintenance  taxes and fees  insurance and fuel 
we use a number of programs to reduce overall cost of operations  including increasing the use of automated routes to reduce labor and workers compensation exposure  utilizing comprehensive maintenance and health and safety programs  and increasing the use of transfer stations to further enhance internalization rates 
we carry high deductible insurance for automobile liability  property  general liability  workers compensation  employer s liability and employer group health claims 
if we experience insurance claims or costs above or below our historically evaluated levels  our estimates could be materially affected 
selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expense includes management  sales force  clerical and administrative employee compensation and benefits  legal  accounting and other professional services  acquisition  bad debt expense and rent expense for our corporate headquarters 
depreciation expense includes depreciation of equipment and fixed assets over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method 
depletion expense includes depletion of landfill site costs and total future development costs as remaining airspace of the landfill is consumed 
remaining airspace at our landfills includes both permitted and probable expansion airspace 
amortization expense includes the amortization of finite lived intangible assets  consisting primarily of long term franchise agreements and contracts  customer lists and non competition agreements  over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  consisting primarily of certain perpetual rights to provide solid waste collection and transportation services in specified territories  are not amortized 
we capitalize some third party expenditures related to development projects  such as legal  engineering and interest expenses 
we expense all third party and indirect acquisition costs  including third party legal and engineering expenses  executive and corporate overhead  public relations and other corporate services  as we incur them 
we charge against net income any unamortized capitalized expenditures and advances net of any portion that we believe we may recover  through sale or otherwise that may become impaired  such as those that relate to any operation that is permanently shut down and any landfill development project that we believe will not be completed 
we routinely evaluate all capitalized costs  and expense those related to projects that we believe are not likely to succeed 
for example  if we are unsuccessful in our attempts to obtain or defend permits that we are seeking or have been awarded to operate or expand a landfill  we will no longer generate anticipated income from the landfill and we will be required to expense in a future period the amount of capitalized expenditures related to the landfill or expansion project  less the recoverable value of the property and other amounts recovered

segment reporting our chief operating decision maker evaluates performance and determines resource allocations based on several factors  of which the primary financial measure is operating income before depreciation  amortization and gain loss on disposal of assets 
operating income before depreciation  amortization and gain loss on disposal of assets is not a measure of operating income  operating performance or liquidity under gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
our management uses operating income before depreciation  amortization and gain loss on disposal of assets in the evaluation of segment operating performance as it is a profit measure that is generally within the control of the operating segments 

table of contents we manage our operations through three geographic operating segments  which are also our reportable segments 
each operating segment is responsible for managing several vertically integrated operations  which are comprised of districts 
in april  as a result of the county waste acquisition described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we realigned our reporting structure and changed our three geographic operating segments from western  central and southern to western  central and eastern 
as part of this realignment  the states of arizona  louisiana  new mexico and texas  which were previously part of the southern region  are now included in the central region 
also as part of this realignment  the state of michigan  which was previously part of the central region  is now included in the eastern region previously referred to as the southern region 
additionally  the states of new york and massachusetts  which we now operate in as a result of the county waste acquisition  are included in the eastern region 
the segment information presented herein reflects the realignment of these districts 
under the current orientation  our western region is comprised of operating locations in california  idaho  montana  nevada  oregon  washington and western wyoming  our central region is comprised of operating locations in arizona  colorado  kansas  louisiana  minnesota  nebraska  new mexico  oklahoma  south dakota  texas  utah and eastern wyoming  and our eastern region is comprised of operating locations in alabama  illinois  iowa  kentucky  massachusetts  michigan  mississippi  new york  north carolina  south carolina and tennessee

total revenues increased million  or  to billion for the year ended december   from billion for the year ended december  acquisitions closed during  or subsequent to  the year ended december   increased revenues by approximately million 
operations divested during  or subsequent to  the year ended december   decreased revenues by approximately million 
during the year ended december   the net increase in prices charged to our customers was million  consisting of million of core price increases and million of fuel  materials and environmental surcharges 
volume decreases in our existing business during the year ended december   decreased revenues by approximately million 
the net decrease in volume was primarily attributable to decreases in commercial hauling activity  partially offset by increases in landfill special waste volumes and roll off hauling activity 
recyclable commodity price increases  which occurred during the nine months ended september   and increased recyclable commodity volumes collected  increased revenues by million 
the increase in recyclable commodity prices during the nine months ended september  was primarily due to increased overseas demand for recyclable commodities 
recyclable commodity prices during the three months ended december  and were consistent as the increased demand occurring during the nine months ended september  did not continue during the final three months of if average recyclable commodity prices during the year ended december  are consistent with the average recyclable commodity prices realized during the three months ended december   we expect recyclable commodity revenue to decline by approximately million to million during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  other revenues increased by million during the year ended december   primarily due to an increase in cargo volume at our intermodal operations

we define adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization as operating income  plus depreciation and amortization expense  plus closure and post closure accretion expense  plus or minus any gain or loss on disposal of assets 
we further adjust this calculation to exclude the effects of items management believes impact the ability to assess the operating performance of our business 
this measure is not a substitute for  and should be used in conjunction with  gaap financial measures 
management uses adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization as one of the principal measures to evaluate and monitor the ongoing financial performance of our operations

reconciliation of net income to adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share  both non gaap financial measures  are provided supplementally because they are widely used by investors as a valuation measure in the solid waste industry 
we provide adjusted net income to exclude the effects of items management believes impact the comparability of operating results between periods 
adjusted net income has limitations due to the fact that it may exclude items that have an impact on our financial condition and results of operations

table of contents inflation other than volatility in fuel prices  inflation has not materially affected our operations in recent years 
consistent with industry practice  many of our contracts allow us to pass through certain costs to our customers  including increases in landfill tipping fees and  in some cases  fuel costs 
therefore  we believe that we should be able to increase prices to offset many cost increases that result from inflation in the ordinary course of business 
however  competitive pressures or delays in the timing of rate increases under our contracts may require us to absorb at least part of these cost increases  especially if cost increases exceed the average rate of inflation 
management s estimates associated with inflation have an impact on our accounting for landfill liabilities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to market risk  including changes in interest rates and prices of certain commodities 
we use hedge agreements to manage a portion of our risks related to interest rates and fuel prices 
while we are exposed to credit risk in the event of non performance by counterparties to our hedge agreements  in all cases such counterparties are highly rated financial institutions and we do not anticipate non performance 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
we monitor our hedge positions by regularly evaluating the positions at market and by performing sensitivity analyses over the unhedged fuel and variable rate debt positions 
at december   our derivative instruments included three interest rate swap agreements that effectively fix the interest rate on the applicable notional amounts of our variable rate debt as follows dollars in thousands fixed variable notional interest interest rate date entered amount rate paid received effective date expiration date march  month libor february february august  month libor april january december  month libor february february plus applicable margin 
under derivatives and hedging guidance  all the interest rate swap agreements are considered cash flow hedges for a portion of our variable rate debt  and we apply hedge accounting to account for these instruments 
the notional amounts and all other significant terms of the swap agreements are matched to the provisions and terms of the variable rate debt being hedged 
on october   we terminated two of our interest rate swap agreements in conjunction with issuing our notes 
we terminated an interest rate swap in the amount of million that would have expired in march and an interest rate swap in the amount of million that would have expired in june as a result of terminating these interest rate swaps  we made a cash payment of million to the counterparty of the swap agreements 
further  because we used the proceeds of the notes to reduce the borrowings under our senior uncollateralized revolving credit facility  it is no longer probable that the forecasted transactions that were being hedged by these interest rate swap agreements will occur 
therefore  we recorded a charge of million to other expense in the fourth quarter of we have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market rate changes will affect the fair value of our unhedged floating rate debt 
such an analysis is inherently limited in that it reflects a singular  hypothetical set of assumptions 
actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions 
fair value sensitivity is not necessarily indicative of the ultimate cash flow or earnings effect we would recognize from the assumed market rate movements 
we are exposed to cash flow risk due to changes in interest rates with respect to the unhedged floating rate balances owed at december  and  of million and million  respectively  including floating rate debt under our credit facility and floating rate municipal bond obligations 
a one percentage point increase in interest rates on our variable rate debt as of december  and  would decrease our annual pre tax income by approximately million and million  respectively 
all of our remaining debt instruments are at fixed rates  or effectively fixed under the interest rate swap agreements described above  therefore  changes in market interest rates under these instruments would not significantly impact our cash flows or results of operations  subject to counterparty default risk 

table of contents the market price of diesel fuel is unpredictable and can fluctuate significantly 
we purchase approximately million gallons of diesel fuel per year  therefore  a significant increase in the price of fuel could adversely affect our business and reduce our operating margins 
to manage a portion of this risk  in  we entered into fuel hedge agreements related to forecasted diesel fuel purchases 
at december   our derivative instruments included one fuel hedge agreement as follows diesel rate notional paid amount fixed in gallons per per diesel rate received effective expiration date entered month gallon variable date date december  doe diesel fuel index january december if the national us on highway average price for a gallon of diesel fuel average price  as published by the department of energy  exceeds the contract price per gallon  we receive the difference between the average price and the contract price multiplied by the notional number of gallons from the counterparty 
if the average price is less than the contract price per gallon  we pay the difference to the counterparty 
under derivatives and hedging guidance  the fuel hedge is considered a cash flow hedge for a portion of our forecasted diesel fuel purchases  and we apply hedge accounting to account for this instrument 
we have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market rate changes will affect the fair value of our unhedged diesel fuel purchases 
such an analysis is inherently limited in that it reflects a singular  hypothetical set of assumptions 
actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions 
fair value sensitivity is not necessarily indicative of the ultimate cash flow or earnings effect we would recognize from the assumed market rate movements 
for the year ending december   we expect to purchase approximately million gallons of diesel fuel  of which million gallons will be purchased at market prices and million gallons will be purchased at prices that are fixed under our fuel hedges 
with respect to the approximately million gallons of unhedged diesel fuel we expect to purchase in at market prices  a per gallon increase in the price of fuel over the year would decrease our pre tax income during this period by approximately million 
we market a variety of recyclable materials  including cardboard  office paper  plastic containers  glass bottles and ferrous and aluminum metals 
we own and operate recycling processing operations and sell other collected recyclable materials to third parties for processing before resale 
certain of our municipal recycling contracts in the state of washington specify benchmark resale prices for recycled commodities 
if the prices we actually receive for the processed recycled commodities collected under the contract exceed the prices specified in the contract  we share the excess with the municipality  after recovering any previous shortfalls resulting from actual market prices falling below the prices specified in the contract 
to reduce our exposure to commodity price risk with respect to recycled materials  we have adopted a pricing strategy of charging collection and processing fees for recycling volume collected from third parties 
in the event of a decline in recycled commodity prices  a decrease in average recycled commodity prices from the average prices that were in effect during the year ended december  and  would have had a million and million impact on revenues for the year ended december  and  respectively
