item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations hei the following discussion should be read in conjunction with hawaiian electric industries  inc s hei s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the general discussion of hei s consolidated results should be read in conjunction with the segment discussions of the electric utilities and the bank that follow 
hei consolidated executive overview and strategy 
hei is a holding company that operates subsidiaries collectively  the company  principally in hawaii s electric utility and banking sectors 
hei s strategy is to build fundamental earnings and profitability of its electric utilities and bank in a controlled risk manner to support its current dividend and improve operating and capital efficiency in order to build shareholder value 
hei  through its electric utility subsidiaries hawaiian electric company  inc heco and its subsidiaries  hawaii electric light company  inc helco and maui electric company  limited meco  provides the only electric public utility service to approximately of hawaii s population 
hei also provides a wide array of banking and other financial services to consumers and businesses through its bank subsidiary  american savings bank  fsb asb  one of hawaii s largest financial institutions based on total assets 
in  the company initiated aggressive strategies to set both the utilities and asb on a new course the utilities entered into an agreement with the state to create a clean energy future for hawaii and asb set new performance standards 
in  the company continued to make major progress on these strategies see segment discussions below 
together  hei s unique combination of electric utilities and a bank continues to provide the company with a strong balance sheet and the financial resources to invest in the strategic growth of its subsidiaries while providing an attractive dividend for investors 
in  net income for hei common stock was million  compared to million in basic earnings per share were per share in  up from per share in due to higher earnings for the electric utility and bank segments  partly offset by slightly higher losses for the other segment and the effects of the higher weighted average number of shares outstanding 
electric utility net income for common stock in of million increased from the prior year due primarily to higher interim and final rate increases and decoupling revenue adjustments 
key to results for will be the impacts of actions taken under the hawaii clean energy initiative hcei and energy agreement  including the steps taken toward the integration of new generation from a variety of renewable energy sources into the utility systems  and managing o m expenses to the levels included in rates 
asb s earnings in of million increased million over prior year net income due primarily to lower provision for loan losses and noninterest expenses  partly offset by lower net interest and noninterest income 
asb s future financial results will continue to be impacted by the interest rate environment  the quality of asb s loan portfolio  and the ongoing results of the performance improvement project 
hei s other segment had a net loss in of million  comparable to the net loss in hei s consolidated effective tax rate was in compared to in the decrease in the effective tax rate was due primarily to additional low income housing credits and tax free income from municipal bonds and bank owned life insurance at asb  and a favorable irs appeals settlement related to foreign losses at hei in shareholder dividends are declared and paid quarterly by hei at the discretion of hei s board of directors 
hei and its predecessor company  heco  have paid dividends continuously since the dividend has been stable at per share annually since the indicated dividend yield as of december  was 
the dividend payout ratios based on net income for common stock for  and were  and  respectively 
the hei board of directors considers many factors in determining the dividend quarterly  including but not limited to the company s results of operations  the long term prospects for the company  and current and expected future economic conditions 
hei s subsidiaries from time to time consider various strategies designed to enhance their competitive positions and to maximize shareholder value 
these strategies may include the formation of new subsidiaries or the acquisition or disposition of businesses 
the company may from time to time be engaged in preliminary discussions  either internally or with third parties  regarding potential transactions 
management cannot predict whether any of these strategies or transactions will be carried out or  if so  whether they will be successfully implemented 
economic conditions 
note the statistical data in this section is from public third party sources eg  department of business  economic development and tourism dbedt  university of hawaii economic research organization uhero  us bureau of labor statistics  blue chip economic indicators  us energy information administration  hawaii tourism authority hta  honolulu board of realtors  bureau of economic analysis and national and local newspapers 
hawaii s tourism industry  a significant driver of hawaii s economy  maintained a positive growth trend in state visitor arrivals grew by in over state visitor expenditures continued to grow  increasing by in over hotel occupancies and room rates remain higher year over year 
the outlook for the visitor industry remains positive with the hawaii tourism authority expecting a increase in airline seat capacity in the first quarter of  with growth in international flights offset by a slight decline in us mainland capacity 
hawaii s unemployment rate was in december  higher than the in december  but lower than the national unemployment rate of in december hawaii s unemployment rate has slowly worsened since june while the national unemployment rate improved to the lowest level since early hawaii jobs continued to grow year over year through december  but not enough to improve the unemployment rate 
single family residential home sales on oahu decreased in december compared to december  and sales were lower than by 
median prices were slightly higher in december  but for the full year median prices were lower than the price of a barrel of west texas intermediate wti crude oil reached on april   its highest level since  but declined somewhat to average per barrel in december however  while mainland wti us prices have declined from the peak in april  hawaii s petroleum product prices  which reflect supply and demand in the asia pacific region and the price of crude oil on international markets  have remained high  owing in part to the disruption occasioned by the tragic earthquake and tsunami in japan in march the dramatic reduction in nuclear production has increased regional demand for oil and the utilities oil prices have remained consistently high for most of the federal open market committee fomc held the federal funds rate target at to percent on january   citing low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation 
the fomc also expects the low federal funds rate to continue through late based on the current economic outlook and continued its program announced in september to extend the average maturity of the system open market account portfolio to support a stronger economic recovery 
overall  hawaii s economy is expected to see only modest growth in and with local economic growth supported by only moderate improvement in the us economy and impeded by some apparent slowing in global economies 
recent tax developments 
the tax relief  unemployment insurance reauthorization and job creation act the act enacted at the end of contained major tax provisions which continue to impact the company 
specifically the and bonus depreciation provisions for certain property result in an estimated net increase in federal tax depreciation of million for and million for  primarily attributable to the utilities 
in addition  the act provided for a reduction in the social security tax on employees and self employed individuals for the temporary payroll tax cut continuation act of extended this reduction through february in december  the internal revenue service irs issued temporary regulations  which provide a framework for determining whether expenditures are deductible as repairs 
although labeled temporary  these regulations have the binding effect of final regulations and are effective january  the irs is expected to issue additional revenue procedures containing transitional rules and guidance 
the company will analyze these regulations and any subsequently issued guidance for their impacts and for the opportunities they present for and future years

see executive overview and strategy above and the other segment  electric utility and bank sections below for discussions of results of operations 
retirement benefits 
the company s reported costs of providing retirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions about future experience 
for example  retirement benefits costs are impacted by actual employee demographics including age and compensation levels  the level of contributions to the plans  plus earnings and realized and unrealized gains and losses on plan assets  and changes made to the provisions of the plans 
during  for example  the qualified retirement plan for employees of hei and heco was changed for employees hired on or after may  those employees will receive lower benefit accruals  different early retirement reduction factors and no automatic cost of living increases 
the change is expected to decrease ongoing costs through a reduction in service cost 
see note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements 
costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions  including the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate 
the company s accounting for retirement benefits under the plans in which the employees of heco and its subsidiaries participate is also adjusted to account for the impact of decisions by the public utilities commission of the state of hawaii puc 
changes in obligations associated with the factors noted above may not be immediately recognized as costs on the income statement  but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants 
the assumptions used by management in making benefit and funding calculations are based on current economic conditions 
changes in economic conditions will impact the underlying assumptions in determining retirement benefits costs on a prospective basis 
for  the company s retirement benefit plans assets generated a loss of  including investment management fees  resulting in net losses and unrealized losses of million  compared to net earnings and unrealized gains of million for and net earnings and unrealized gains of million for the market value of the retirement benefit plans assets for both december  and was million 
the company intends to make contributions to the qualified retirement plan for hei and heco equal to the calculated net periodic pension cost for the year 
however  if the minimum required contribution determined under the employee retirement income security act of erisa  as amended by the pension protection act of  for the year is greater than the net periodic pension cost  then the company will contribute the minimum required contribution and the utilities difference between the minimum required contribution and the net periodic pension cost will increase their regulatory asset 
in the next rate case  the regulatory asset will be amortized over five years and used to reduce the cash funding requirement based on net periodic pension cost 
the regulatory asset may not be applied against the erisa minimum required contribution 
the erisa minimum required contribution is expected to be higher than the net periodic pension cost for and therefore  the pension protection act minimum required contribution will be the basis of the cash funding for and as shown in the following table and constitutes forward looking statements in millions pension protection act estimated minimum required contribution based on plan assets as of december  consolidated heco consolidated hei the company s pension protection act minimum required contribution in is estimated to increase to million primarily due to the decrease in the effective interest rate 
the estimated subsequent decrease in to million is primarily due to assumed asset growth outpacing assumed liability growth 
actual results  however  could differ substantially from these estimates 
based on various assumptions in note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements and assuming no further changes in retirement benefit plan provisions  information regarding consolidated hei s  consolidated heco s and asb s retirement benefits was  or is estimated to be  as follows  and constitutes forward looking statements aoci balance  net of tax benefits  related to retirement benefits liability retirement benefits expense  net of tax benefits retirement benefits paid and plan expenses december years ended december years ended december in millions estimated consolidated hei consolidated heco asb sensitivities of the projected benefit obligation pbo and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation apbo as of december   associated with a change in certain actuarial assumptions  were as follows and constitute forward looking statements

the impact on net income for common stock for changes in actuarial assumptions should be immaterial based on the adoption by the electric utilities of pension and postretirement benefits other than pensions opeb tracking mechanisms approved by the puc

other segment 
dollars in millions change change revenues nm nm operating loss nm nm net loss nm nm including writedowns of and net gains and losses from investments 
nmnot meaningful 
the other business segment includes results of the stand alone corporate operations of hei and american savings holdings  inc ashi  both holding companies  hei properties  inc heipi  a company holding passive  venture capital investments venture capital investments valued at million as of december   and the old oahu tug service  inc toots  a maritime freight transportation company that ceased operations in  hei investments  inc heiii  a company previously holding investments in leveraged leases but whose wind down was substantially completed during  pacific energy conservation services  inc pecs  a contract services company which provided windfarm operational and maintenance services to an affiliated electric utility until the windfarm was dismantled in the fourth quarter of and dissolved in the second quarter of  as well as eliminations of intercompany transactions 
hei corporate level operating  general and administrative expenses were million in compared to million in each of and in  expense increased primarily due to the accrual of million of contributions to be made to the hei charitable foundation in in  expenses increased slightly primarily due to higher compensation expense  partly offset by lower retirement benefit expense and an accrual in to dismantle a windfarm in the other segment s interest expenses were million in  million in and million in in and  financing costs were higher due in part to the recognition of the ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the forward starting swaps 
also in  there was a higher level of borrowings 
the other segment s income tax benefits were million in  million in and million in the increase in income tax benefits in was primarily due to higher operating losses  higher interest expense and a favorable settlement in in an irs appeal related to the character ordinary versus capital of a foreign loss  and the write off in of a deferred tax asset due to the expiration of a capital loss carryforward period 
effects of inflation 
us inflation  as measured by the us consumer price index cpi  averaged in  in and in hawaii inflation  as measured by the honolulu cpi  was in and in the department of business  economic development and tourism estimates average honolulu cpi to have been in and forecasts it to be for inflation continues to have an impact on hei s operations 
inflation increases operating costs and the replacement cost of assets 
subsidiaries with significant physical assets  such as the electric utilities  replace assets at much higher costs and must request and obtain rate increases to maintain adequate earnings 
in the past  the puc has granted rate increases in part to cover increases in construction costs and operating expenses due to inflation

liquidity and capital resources 
selected contractual obligations and commitments 
information about payments under the specified contractual obligations and commercial commitments was as follows december  payments due by period in millions total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations deposit liabilities other bank borrowings long term debt interest on certificates of deposit  other bank borrowings and long term debt operating leases  service bureau contract and maintenance agreements open purchase order obligations fuel oil purchase obligations estimate based on december  fuel oil prices power purchase obligations minimum fixed capacity charges liabilities for uncertain tax positions total estimated deposits that have no maturity are included in the less than year column  however  they may have a duration longer than one year 
includes contractual obligations and commitments for capital expenditures and expense amounts 
december  total in millions other commercial commitments to asb customers loan commitments primarily expiring in loans in process unused lines and letters of credit total the tables above do not include other categories of obligations and commitments  such as deferred taxes  trade payables  amounts that will become payable in future periods under collective bargaining and other employment agreements and employee benefit plans  obligations that may arise under indemnities provided to purchasers of discontinued operations and potential refunds of amounts collected under interim decision and orders d os of the puc 
as of december   the fair value of the assets held in trusts to satisfy the obligations of the company s retirement benefit plans did not exceed the retirement benefit plans benefit obligation 
minimum funding requirements for retirement benefit plans have not been included in the tables above  however  see retirement benefits above for estimated minimum required contributions for and see note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of fuel and power purchase commitments 
the company believes that its ability to generate cash  both internally from electric utility and banking operations and externally from issuances of equity and debt securities  commercial paper and bank borrowings  is adequate to maintain sufficient liquidity to fund its contractual obligations and commercial commitments  its forecasted capital expenditures and investments  its expected retirement benefit plan contributions and other cash requirements in the foreseeable future 
the company s total assets were billion as of december  and billion as of december  the consolidated capital structure of hei excluding deposit liabilities and other bank borrowings was as follows december dollars in millions short term borrowings other than bank long term debt  net other than bank preferred stock of subsidiaries common stock equity hei s short term borrowings and hei s line of credit facility were as follows year ended december  in millions average balance end of period balance december  short term borrowings commercial paper line of credit draws undrawn capacity under hei s line of credit facility expiring december  this table does not include heco s separate commercial paper issuances and line of credit facilities and draws  which are disclosed below under electric utility financial condition liquidity and capital resources 
at february   hei s outstanding commercial paper balance was million and its line of credit facility was undrawn 
the maximum amount of hei s short term borrowings in was million 
hei utilizes short term debt  typically commercial paper  to support normal operations  to refinance commercial paper  to retire long term debt  to pay dividends and for other temporary requirements 
hei also periodically makes short term loans to heco to meet heco s cash requirements  including the funding of loans by heco to helco and meco  but no such short term loans to heco were outstanding as of december  hei periodically utilizes long term debt  historically consisting of medium term notes and other unsecured indebtedness  to fund investments in and loans to its subsidiaries to support their capital improvement or other requirements  to repay long term and short term indebtedness and for other corporate purposes 
in november  hei filed an omnibus registration statement to register an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities 
under securities and exchange commission sec regulations  this registration statement expires on november  on march   hei issued million of senior notes via a private placement million of notes due march  and million of notes due march  
hei used part of the net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes to pay down commercial paper originally issued to refinance million of medium term notes that matured on march  and ultimately used the remaining proceeds to refinance part of the million of medium term notes that matured on august  the note agreement contains customary representation and warranties  affirmative and negative covenants  and events of default the occurrence of which may result in some or all of the notes then outstanding becoming immediately due and payable and provisions requiring the maintenance by hei of certain financial ratios generally consistent with those in hei s revolving noncollateralized credit agreement  expiring on december  for example  it is an event of default if hei fails to maintain a nonconsolidated capitalization ratio funded debt of or less ratio of as of december   as calculated under the agreement or consolidated net worth of at least million net worth of billion as of december   as calculated under the agreement 
the note agreement also requires that hei offer to prepay the notes upon a change of control or certain dispositions of assets as defined in the note agreement 
hei has a line of credit facility of million 
see note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements 
the credit agreement  amended in december  contains provisions for revised pricing in the event of a ratings change 
for example  a ratings downgrade of hei s issuer rating eg  from bbb baa to bbb baa by standard poor s s p and moody s investors service moody s  respectively would result in a commitment fee increase of basis points and an interest rate increase of basis points on any drawn amounts 
on the other hand  a ratings upgrade eg  from bbb baa to bbb baa by s p or moody s  respectively would result in a commitment fee decrease of basis points and an interest rate decrease of basis points on any drawn amounts 
the agreement contains customary conditions which must be met in order to draw on it  including compliance with its covenants such as covenants preventing its subsidiaries from entering into agreements that restrict the ability of the subsidiaries to pay dividends to  or to repay borrowings from  hei 
in addition to customary defaults  hei s failure to maintain its financial ratios  as defined in its agreement  or meet other requirements may result in an event of default 
for example  under its agreement  it is an event of default if hei fails to maintain a nonconsolidated capitalization ratio funded debt of or less ratio of as of december   as calculated under the agreement and consolidated net worth of at least million net worth of billion as of december   as calculated under the agreement  or if hei no longer owns heco 
in addition to their impact on pricing under hei s credit agreement  the rating of hei s commercial paper and debt securities could significantly impact the ability of hei to sell its commercial paper and issue debt securities and or the cost of such debt 
the rating agencies use a combination of qualitative measures ie  assessment of business risk that incorporates an analysis of the qualitative factors such as management  competitive positioning  operations  markets and regulation as well as quantitative measures eg  cash flow  debt  interest coverage and liquidity ratios in determining the ratings of hei securities 
on august   moody s maintained hei s long term and short term commercial paper ratings and stable outlook  indicating that the ratings reflect the relatively stable earnings and cash flow historically provided by its vertically integrated utility businesses and banking operation 
the stable rating outlook factors in moody s belief that the decoupling mechanism will reduce regulatory lag and better match cost recovery of expenses and capital investment such that heco s consolidated roe will approach authorized returns over time and the expectation that profitability initiatives at asb will produce fairly predictable earnings enabling asb to provide regular dividends to hei without jeopardizing the bank s strong capital position 
moody s indicated the rating could be downgraded if the puc does not follow through with the regulatory transformation contemplated under the hcei  including all elements of the decoupling mechanism or if hei s cash flow to debt declined to below last twelve months as of march  latest reported by moody s and its cash flow coverage of interest fell below times times last twelve months as of march  latest reported by moody s on a sustainable basis 
on november   s p maintained hei s long term and corporate credit rating of bbb  short term commercial paper rating of a  stable outlook and aggressive financial profile 
the stable outlook reflects s p s view that despite anticipated weaker cash flow metrics in and  the consolidated credit profile will remain consistent with the hei bbb ratings and the expectation that any financial profile improvements from decoupling approved this year for heco will be gradual 
s p indicated the rating could come under pressure if rate case disallowances are significant enough to drive hei s funds from operations ffo to total debt to less than and ffo interest coverage to less than times  and or if leverage exceeds fully adjusted on a consistent basis 
as of february   the s p and moody s ratings of hei securities were as follows s p moody s commercial paper a p senior unsecured debt bbb baa the above ratings reflect only the view  at the time the ratings are issued  of the applicable rating agency  from whom an explanation of the significance of such ratings may be obtained 
such ratings are not recommendations to buy  sell or hold any securities  such ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agencies  and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
management believes that  if hei s commercial paper ratings were to be downgraded  or if credit markets for commercial paper with hei s ratings or in general were to tighten  it could be more difficult and or expensive for hei to sell commercial paper or hei might not be able to sell commercial paper in the future 
such limitations could cause hei to draw on its syndicated credit facility instead  and the costs of such borrowings could increase under the terms of the credit agreement as a result of any such ratings downgrades 
similarly  if hei s long term debt ratings were to be downgraded  it could be more difficult and or expensive for hei to issue long term debt 
such limitations and or increased costs could materially adversely affect the results of operations  financial condition and liquidity of hei and its subsidiaries 
issuances of common stock through the hawaiian electric industries  inc dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan drip  hawaiian electric industries retirement savings plan heirsp and the asb k plan which was split off from heirsp in provided new capital of million approximately million shares in  million approximately million shares in and million approximately million shares in from april  through september  and from august  to december   hei satisfied the share purchase requirements of the drip  heirsp and asb k plan through open market purchases of its common stock rather than new issuances 
operating activities provided net cash of million in  million in and million in investing activities provided used net cash of million in  million in and million in in  net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to purchases of investment and mortgage related securities  heco s consolidated capital expenditures net of contributions in aid of construction and a net increase in loans held for investment  partly offset by the repayments of  and the proceeds from sales of  investment and mortgage related securities 
financing activities provided used net cash of million in  million in and million in in  net cash provided by financing activities included net increases in deposits and short term borrowings and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under hei plans  offset by the net decrease in long term debt and other bank borrowings and the payment of common and preferred stock dividends 
other than capital contributions from their parent company  intercompany services and related intercompany payables and receivables  heco s periodic short term borrowings from hei and related interest and the payment of dividends to hei  the electric utility and bank segments are largely autonomous in their operating  investing and financing activities 
see the electric utility and bank segments discussions of their cash flows in their respective financial condition liquidity and capital resources sections below 
during  heco and asb paid cash dividends to hei of million and million  respectively 
a portion of the net assets of heco and asb is not available for transfer to hei in the form of dividends  loans or advances without regulatory approval 
one of the conditions to the puc s approval of the merger and corporate restructuring of heco and hei requires that heco maintain a consolidated common equity to total capitalization ratio of not less than actual ratio of at december   and restricts heco from making distributions to hei to the extent it would result in that ratio being less than 
in the absence of an unexpected material adverse change in the financial condition of the electric utilities or asb  such restrictions are not expected to significantly affect the operations of hei  its ability to pay dividends on its common stock or its ability to meet its debt or other cash obligations 
see note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements 
forecasted hei consolidated net cash used in investing activities excluding investing cash flows from asb for through consists primarily of the net capital expenditures of heco and its subsidiaries 
in addition to the funds required for the electric utilities construction programs see electric utility liquidity and capital resources  approximately million will be required during through to repay maturing hei medium term notes  which are expected to be repaid with the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper  bank borrowings  other medium or long term debt  common stock issued under company plans and or dividends from subsidiaries 
in addition  heco special purpose revenue bonds sprbs totaling million will be maturing during through and are expected to be repaid with proceeds from issuances of long term debt 
additional debt and or equity financing may be utilized to invest in the utilities and bank  pay down commercial paper or other short term borrowings or may be required to fund unanticipated expenditures not included in the through forecast  such as increases in the costs of or an acceleration of the construction of capital projects of the utilities  unanticipated utility capital expenditures that may be required by the hcei or new environmental laws and regulations  unbudgeted acquisitions or investments in new businesses  significant increases in retirement benefit funding requirements and higher tax payments that would result if certain tax positions taken by the company do not prevail or if taxes are increased by federal or state legislation 
in addition  existing debt may be refinanced prior to maturity potentially at more favorable rates with additional debt or equity financing or both 
as further explained in retirement benefits above and notes and of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements  the company maintains pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
the company was required to make contributions of million for and million for  but was not required to make any contributions for to the qualified pension plans to meet minimum funding requirements pursuant to erisa  including changes promulgated by the pension protection act of the company also made additional voluntary contributions to these plans in  and contributions to the retirement benefit plans totaled million in comprised of million by the utilities  million by hei and nil by asb  million in and million in and are expected to total million in million by the utilities  million by hei and nil by asb 
in addition  the company paid directly million of benefits in each of and and million in and expects to pay million of benefits in depending on the performance of the assets held in the plans trusts and numerous other factors  additional contributions may be required in the future to meet the minimum funding requirements of erisa or to pay benefits to plan participants 
the company believes it will have adequate cash flow or access to capital resources to support any necessary funding requirements 
off balance sheet arrangements 
although the company has off balance sheet arrangements  management has determined that it has no off balance sheet arrangements that either have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future effect on the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors  including the following types of off balance sheet arrangements obligations under guarantee contracts  retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangements that serve as credit  liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets  obligations under derivative instruments  and obligations under a material variable interest held by the company in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to the company  or engages in leasing  hedging or research and development services with the company 
certain factors that may affect future results and financial condition 
the company s results of operations and financial condition can be affected by numerous factors  many of which are beyond its control and could cause future results of operations to differ materially from historical results 
the following is a discussion of certain of these factors 
also see forward looking statements above and certain factors that may affect future results and financial condition in each of the electric utility and bank segment discussions below 
economic conditions  us capital markets and credit and interest rate environment 
because the core businesses of hei s subsidiaries are providing local electric public utility services and banking services in hawaii  the company s operating results are significantly influenced by hawaii s economy  which in turn is influenced by economic conditions in the mainland us particularly california and asia particularly japan as a result of the impact of those conditions on tourism  by the impact of interest rates  particularly on the construction and real estate industries  and by the impact of world conditions on federal government spending in hawaii 
the two largest components of hawaii s economy are tourism and the federal government including the military 
declines in the hawaii  us and asian economies in recent years led to declines in kwh sales  delinquencies in asb s loan portfolio and other adverse effects on hei s businesses 
if s p or moody s were to further downgrade hei s or heco s debt ratings  or if future events were to adversely affect the availability of capital to the company  hei s and heco s ability to borrow and raise capital could be constrained and their future borrowing costs would likely increase 
changes in the us capital markets can also have significant effects on the company 
for example  pension funding requirements are affected by the market performance of the assets in the master pension trust  and by the discount rate used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost and value obligations 
the electric utilities pension tracking mechanisms help moderate pension expense  however  a decline in the value of the company s defined benefit pension plan assets may increase the unfunded status of the company s pension plans and result in increases in future funding requirements 
because the earnings of asb depend primarily on net interest income  interest rate risk is a significant risk of asb s operations 
hei and its electric utility subsidiaries are also exposed to interest rate risk primarily due to their periodic borrowing requirements  the discount rate used to determine pension funding requirements and the possible effect of interest rates on the electric utilities rates of return and overall economic activity 
interest rates are sensitive to many factors  including general economic conditions and the policies of government and regulatory authorities 
hei cannot predict future changes in interest rates  nor be certain that interest rate risk management strategies it or its subsidiaries have implemented will be successful in managing interest rate risk 
changes in interest rates and credit spreads also affect the fair value of asb s investment securities 
in  the credit markets experienced significant disruptions  liquidity on many financial instruments declined and residential mortgage delinquencies and defaults increased 
these disruptions negatively impacted the fair value of asb s investment portfolio in however  with the fourth quarter sale of asb s remaining private issue mortgage related securities portfolio and substantial residential loan production in and  the company s exposure to credit and interest rate risks have been reduced 
limited insurance 
in the ordinary course of business  the company purchases insurance coverages eg  property and liability coverages to protect itself against loss of or damage to its properties and against claims made by third parties and employees for property damage or personal injuries 
however  the protection provided by such insurance is limited in significant respects and  in some instances  the company has no coverage 
heco  helco and meco s transmission and distribution systems excluding substation buildings and contents have a replacement value roughly estimated at billion and are uninsured 
similarly  heco  helco and meco have no business interruption insurance 
if a hurricane or other uninsured catastrophic natural disaster were to occur  and if the puc were not to allow the utilities to recover from ratepayers restoration costs and revenues lost from business interruption  their results of operations  financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely impacted 
certain of the company s insurance has substantial deductibles or has limits on the maximum amounts that may be recovered 
insurers also have exclusions or limitations of coverage for claims related to certain perils including  but not limited to  mold and terrorism 
if a series of losses occurred  such as from a series of lawsuits in the ordinary course of business each of which were subject to an insurance deductible amount  or if the maximum limit of the available insurance were substantially exceeded  the company could incur uninsured losses in amounts that would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
environmental matters 
hei and its subsidiaries are subject to environmental laws and regulations that regulate the operation of existing facilities  the construction and operation of new facilities and the proper cleanup and disposal of hazardous waste and toxic substances 
these laws and regulations  among other things  may require that certain environmental permits be obtained and maintained as a condition to constructing or operating certain facilities 
obtaining such permits can entail significant expense and cause substantial construction delays 
also  these laws and regulations may be amended from time to time  including amendments that increase the burden and expense of compliance 
material estimates and critical accounting policies 
in preparing financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change include the amounts reported for investment and mortgage related securities  property  plant and equipment  pension and other postretirement benefit obligations  contingencies and litigation  income taxes  regulatory assets and liabilities  electric utility revenues  and allowance for loan losses 
management considers an accounting estimate to be material if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the assumptions selected could have a material impact on the estimate and on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
in accordance with sec release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  management has identified accounting policies it believes to be the most critical to the company s financial statements that is  management believes that the policies discussed below are both the most important to the portrayal of the company s results of operations and financial condition  and currently require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
the policies affecting both of the company s two principal segments are discussed below and the policies affecting just one segment are discussed in the respective segment s section of material estimates and critical accounting policies 
management has reviewed the material estimates and critical accounting policies with the hei audit committee and  as applicable  the heco audit committee

the company is subject to proceedings including puc proceedings  lawsuits and other claims 
management assesses the likelihood of any adverse judgments in or outcomes of these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses  including costs of investigation 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is based on an analysis of each individual case or proceeding often with the assistance of outside counsel 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach in dealing with these matters  such as a change in settlement strategy 
in general  environmental contamination treatment costs are charged to expense  unless it is probable that the puc would allow such costs to be recovered through future rates  in which case such costs would be capitalized as regulatory assets 
also  environmental costs are capitalized if the costs extend the life  increase the capacity  or improve the safety or efficiency of property  the costs mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination  or the costs are incurred in preparing the property for sale 
income taxes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are established for the temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax bases of the company s assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect when such deferred tax assets or liabilities are realized or settled 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management evaluates its potential exposures from tax positions taken that have or could be challenged by taxing authorities 
these potential exposures result because taxing authorities may take positions that differ from those taken by management in the interpretation and application of statutes  regulations and rules 
management considers the possibility of alternative outcomes based upon past experience  previous actions by taxing authorities eg  actions taken in other jurisdictions and advice from its tax advisors 
management believes that the company s provision for tax contingencies is reasonable 
however  the ultimate resolution of tax treatments disputed by governmental authorities may adversely affect the company s current and deferred income tax amounts 
following are discussions of the electric utility and bank segments 
additional segment information is shown in note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements 
the discussion concerning hawaiian electric company  inc should be read in conjunction with its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
electric utility executive overview and strategy 
the electric utilities strategic focus has been to meet hawaii s growing energy needs through a combination of diverse activities modernizing and adding needed infrastructure through capital investment  placing emphasis on energy efficiency and conservation  pursuing renewable energy generation including the use of biofuels and taking the necessary steps to secure regulatory support for their plans 
reliability projects remain a priority for heco and its subsidiaries 
heco has completed construction of a new generating unit that uses biodiesel fuel and has completed the first phase and is currently constructing the remaining phase of the east oahu transmission project eotp a needed alternative route to move power from the west side of oahu to load centers on the east side 
heco and its subsidiaries have been taking actions intended to protect hawaii s island ecology and reduce greenhouse gas ghg emissions  while continuing to provide reliable power to customers 
a three pronged strategy supports attainment of the requirements and goals of the state of hawaii renewable portfolio standards rps  the hawaii global warming solutions act of and the hcei by the greening of existing assets  the expansion of renewable energy generation and the acceleration of energy efficiency and load management programs 
utility strategic progress 
in  the utilities continued to make significant progress in implementing their clean energy strategies and the puc issued several important regulatory decisions  all of which are key steps to support hawaii s efforts to reduce its dependence on oil 
included in the puc decisions were a number of interim and final rate case decisions see table in most recent rate proceedings below 
additional puc decisions are needed that will allow the utilities to recover their increasing expenditures for clean energy and reliability on a more timely basis 
regulatory 
with puc approval  heco implemented decoupling on march  decoupling is a new regulatory model that is intended to facilitate meeting the state s goals to transition to a clean energy economy and achieve an aggressive renewable portfolio standard 
the decoupling model implemented in hawaii delinks revenues from sales and includes annual revenue adjustments for o m expenses and rate base additions 
the decoupling mechanism has three components a sales decoupling component via a revenue balancing account rba  a revenue escalation component via a revenue adjustment mechanism ram and an earnings sharing mechanism  which would provide for a reduction of rates between rate cases in the event the utility exceeds the return on average common equity roace allowed in its most recent rate case 
decoupling provides for more timely cost recovery and earning on investments 
in the second half of  decoupling has resulted in an improvement in heco s under earning situation that has existed over the last several years 
prior to and during the transition to decoupling  however  the utilities returns have been well below puc allowed returns 
in february  helco received the final d o in its rate case  which approved decoupling 
decoupling will be implemented for helco when the final rates in its rate case become effective 
under decoupling  the most significant drivers for improving earnings are spending within puc approved amounts for major projects and completing projects on schedule  managing o m expenses relative to authorized o m adjustments  especially during periods of increasing demand  and rate case outcomes that cover o m requirements and rate base items not included in the rams 
effective march   as part of the decoupling implementation  heco established the rba and started recording the difference between target revenues from its heco rate case and actual revenues 
beginning june   heco began accruing and collecting ram revenues of million annually  or million per month  which was superseded on july  by the implementation of interim rates in heco s general rate case see most recent rate proceedings below 
under the decoupling tariff order  in future non general rate case years  heco will accrue and collect ths of the annual ram adjusted revenues in one year and the remaining ths in the following year 
heco had expected to be able to accrue ram adjusted revenues from january of each ram period 
also critical to improving earnings are heco s rate case  decoupling implementation for meco and the outcome of the regulatory audits to be conducted on certain major projects 
see major projects in note to hei s notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the regulatory audits ordered by the puc 
the heco rate case interim d o reset target revenues  o m expenses and rate base for the decoupling mechanisms until a final d o is issued 
future earnings growth is also dependent on rate base growth 
the utilities five year forecast reflects net capital expenditures of billion and a compounded annual rate base growth rate of approximately to 
many of the major initiatives within this forecast are expected to be completed beyond the year period 
major initiatives which comprise approximately of the year plan include projects relating to environmental compliance  fuel infrastructure investments  new generation  and infrastructure investments to integrate renewables into the system 
estimates for these initiatives could change with time  based on external factors such as the timing and technical requirements for environmental compliance 
actual and puc allowed returns were as follows return on rate base rorb roace year ended december  heco helco meco heco helco meco utility returns puc allowed returns difference based on recorded operating income and average rate base  both adjusted for items not included in determining electric rates

the electric utilities initiate puc proceedings from time to time to request electric rate increases to cover rising operating costs and the cost of plant and equipment  including the cost of new capital projects to maintain and improve service reliability 
the puc may grant an interim increase within to months following the filing of an application  but there is no guarantee of such an interim increase and interim amounts collected are refundable  with interest  to the extent they exceed the amount approved in the puc s final d o 
the timing and amount of any final increase is determined at the discretion of the puc 
the adoption of revenue  expense  rate base and cost of capital amounts including the roace and rorb for purposes of an interim rate increase does not commit the puc to accept any such amounts in its final d o 
the following table summarizes certain details of each utility s most recent rate cases  including the details of the increases requested  whether the utility and the consumer advocate reached a settlement that they proposed to the puc  and the details of increases granted in interim and final puc d os or whether an interim or final puc d o remains pending

all other line items reflect the effective dates of the revised schedules and tariffs as a result of puc approved increases 
in april  heco reduced this rate increase request by million because a new customer information system would not be placed in service as originally planned see note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements 
because the final increase was million less in annual revenues  heco refunded million to customers including interest in february heco filed a request with the puc for a general rate increase of million  based on a test year and without the then estimated impacts of the implementation of decoupling as proposed in the puc s separate decoupling proceeding and depreciation rates and methodology as proposed by heco in a separate depreciation proceeding 
including the estimated effects of the implementation of decoupling at the time  the effective revenue request was million  or 
heco s request was primarily to pay for major capital projects and higher o m costs to maintain and improve service reliability and to recover the costs for several proposed programs to help reduce hawaii s dependence on imported oil  and to further increase reliability and fuel security 
the million interim increase includes million in annual revenues already being recovered through the decoupling ram 
final d o appealed by a participant in the rate case proceeding 
the appeal is pending  but has not affected implementation of the rate increase 
helco s request was primarily to cover investments for system upgrade projects  two major transmission line upgrades and increasing o m expenses 
on february   the puc issued a final d o  which reflected the approval of decoupling and cost recovery mechanisms 
implementation of final rates is subject to puc review and approval 
see discussion below 
meco s interim increase  effective august   was based on a stipulated agreement reached with the consumer advocate and temporary approval of new depreciation rates and methodology in a separate depreciation proceeding 
the adjustment to this increase  effective january   reflects the final rates from meco s test year rate case 
on february   the puc issued an order instructing meco and the consumer advocate to submit a revised stipulated agreement by march  to provide them the opportunity to incorporate the applicable rulings and decisions in d os issued in related proceedings since the first stipulation was filed  including the final decoupling d o  the final d os in the meco  heco  and helco test year rate cases including the findings related to roace with the implementation of decoupling  the interim d o in the heco test year rate case and the final d o in meco s depreciation proceeding 
meco s request is required to pay for o m expenses and additional investments in plant and equipment required to maintain and improve system reliability and to cover the increased costs to support the integration of more renewable energy generation 
the request is for an increase over rates currently in effect 
meco s electric rates currently in effect include the million annual interim rate increase granted in the test year rate case  which is subject to a final d o and subject to refund with interest if the final d o provides for a lesser increase 
the consumer advocate filed its direct testimony in february and proposed an increase of million  based on a roace of  a rorb of and an average rate base of million 
heco test year rate case 
on july   the puc issued an interim d o in heco s test year rate case  effective july   granting a total annual interim increase of million  or  or an increase of million in annual revenues  or  net of the million of revenues currently being recovered through the decoupling revenue adjustment mechanism ram 
the interim increase is based on  and is substantially the same as  the increase proposed in the settlement agreement executed and filed on july  by heco  the consumer advocate and the department of defense the parties in the proceeding 
the interim increase reflects the new depreciation rates and methods approved by the puc in a separate proceeding  which will result in a million decrease in depreciation expense effective with interim rates to the end of the puc did not approve the portion of the settlement agreement to allow deferral of certain costs amounting to approximately million for including costs related to project management for the interisland wind project and undersea cable system sourcing 
heco filed a motion for clarification and or partial reconsideration of the interim d o s findings and conclusions on the deferral of these costs 
on november   the parties filed a joint motion to adjust the interim increase granted to million  a net reduction of million  to be effective january  as part of the settlement agreement regarding eotp phase costs  the parties filed a joint motion to increase the interim increase that became effective on july  by million  to be effective march   based on the additional revenue requirements reflecting all remaining eotp phase costs not previously included in rates or agreed to be written off and offset by the amounts included in the november  motion 
management cannot predict the timing  or the ultimate outcome  of the orders on the motions and a final d o in this rate case 
see major projects in note to hei s notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the deferral of project costs in the interim d o 
helco test year rate case 
on february   the puc issued a final d o in helco s test year rate case  which allows helco to implement the decoupling mechanism 
in the final d o  the roace of and rorb of reflect the puc s approval of decoupling and other cost recovery mechanisms that the puc concluded will cumulatively lower helco s business risk 
the puc also approved the ppac  which is also intended to lower financial risk of recovery of such expenses 
the final d o accepts helco s proposed austerity adjustment to reduce expenses by million in lieu of the puc s downward adjustments to the labor costs and employee benefits included in the interim d o 
helco will file final revenue requirements  which will reflect the slightly lower depreciation rates and methodology approved in a separate depreciation proceeding 
the heat rates by fuel type that establish the fuel efficiency targets will reflect the current complement of helco units  and the heat rate deadband will be implemented with the effective date of the final rates in this proceeding 
helco expects the final annual revenue requirements may be slightly lower than the interim increase currently in effect due to factors such as the lower depreciation rates and the lower roace 
helco will also implement decoupling  including the ram  and begin tracking the target revenues and actual recorded revenues via the revenue balancing account as established by the decoupling proceeding d o when the final rates in this proceeding become effective 
clean energy strategy 
the utilities policy is to support efforts to increase renewable energy in hawaii 
the utilities believe their actions will help stabilize customer bills over time as they become less dependent on costly and price volatile fossil fuel 
the utilities clean energy strategy will also allow them to meet hawaii s rps law  which requires electric utilities to meet an rps of   and by december    and  respectively 
heco met the rps for with a consolidated rps of  including savings from energy efficiency programs and solar water heating or without dsm energy savings 
energy savings resulting from dsm energy efficiency programs and solar water heating will not count toward the rps after the utilities believe they are on track to meet the rps 
recent developments in the utilities clean energy strategy include in january  helco signed a year contract  subject to puc approval  with aina koa pono ka u llc to supply million gallons of biodiesel per year with initial consumption to begin by in september  however  the puc denied the utilities requested approval of the contract citing the higher cost of the biofuel over the cost of petroleum diesel 
heco  on behalf of helco  is negotiating changes to the original contract with akp with the intent of submitting a new contract to the puc for its approval 
in february  heco successfully demonstrated that unit at its kahe power plant could be powered using up to of biofuel 
in february  helco executed a purchase power agreement ppa amendment with puna geothermal venture pgv for the purchase of energy and capacity from an megawatts mw expansion of pgv s geothermal energy plant on the island of hawaii 
in february  the puc opened dockets related to meco s and heco s plans to proceed with competitive bidding processes to acquire up to approximately mw and mw  respectively  of new  renewable firm dispatchable capacity generation resources  with the initial increments expected to come on line in the and timeframes  respectively 
in  heco issued an oahu renewable energy request for proposals rfp for combined renewable energy projects up to mw 
in  heco executed a ppa with kalaeloa solar two for a mw pv project and a ppa with kawailoa wind  llc for a mw wind project 
included in the bids received in response to the rfp were proposals for two large scale neighbor island wind projects that would produce energy to be imported from lanai and molokai to oahu via a yet to be built undersea transmission cable system 
heco is negotiating with one of the project developers for a mw wind farm to be built on lanai 
the other proposal did not advance after missing a key puc deadline 
further  in july  the puc directed heco to prepare a draft rfp for mw or more of renewable energy for the island of oahu from generation on any of the hawaiian islands 
in october  heco filed a draft rfp with the puc 
in july  heco signed a year contract  subject to puc approval  with pacific biodiesel to supply at least  gallons of locally produced biodiesel for a new mw standby generation facility at the honolulu airport that will be owned by the state and operated by heco  targeted for operation in in august  heco signed a year contract  subject to puc approval  with hawaii bioenergy to supply million gallons per year of biocrude at kahe power plant with initial consumption to begin as early as in august  heco signed a pilot contract  subject to puc approval  with phycal hawaii r d  llc for a single delivery of  to  gallons of biocrude at kahe power plant to conduct testing in in october  heco signed a year contract  subject to puc approval  with reg to supply million to million gallons of biodiesel per year for cip ct if approved  this contract will be in effect upon expiration of the current biodiesel supply contract with reg that expires in july in august  meco successfully demonstrated that its reciprocal diesel engines at maalaea power plant can be powered using biofuel 
other regulatory matters 
in addition to the items below  also see hawaii clean energy initiative and major projects in note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements 
adequacy of supply 
heco 
in february  heco filed its adequacy of supply aos letter  which indicated that based on its may sales and peak forecast  heco s generation capacity for to is sufficiently large to meet all reasonably expected demands for service and provide reasonable reserves for emergencies 
the letter reported that  beginning in  heco anticipates that based on expected increasing demand it will begin experiencing reserve capacity shortfalls if no more firm generating capacity is added to the system 
also  four existing generating units may be retired within the next years because of their age or more stringent environmental regulations 
heco estimates it will need approximately mw of new  firm generating capacity to replace the capacity that would be lost with the retirement of these four units and to accommodate load growth 
helco 
in january  helco filed its aos letter  which indicated that helco s generation capacity through is sufficiently large to meet all reasonably expected demands for service and provide reasonable reserves for emergencies 
in january  helco added mw of renewable capacity from puna geothermal venture 
helco is currently negotiating with one independent power producer ipp to supply additional firm renewable generating capacity to the helco grid 
should this additional firm renewable facility come on line within the next three years as anticipated  helco will not have a need for additional firm capacity in the foreseeable future 
helco  however  may choose to add additional renewable generating capacity to replace existing nonrenewable generation 
in january  helco announced plans to request that the puc open a docket for a geothermal request for proposals 
meco 
in january  meco filed its aos letter  which indicated that meco s generation capacity through is sufficient to meet the forecasted demands on the islands of maui  lanai and molokai  but also stated that additional increments of firm capacity will be needed on maui in and should a major ipp cease providing capacity and energy to meco after december  also  in january  meco filed a request to open a new docket related to meco s plan to proceed with a competitive bidding process to acquire up to approximately mw of new  renewable firm dispatchable capacity generation resources on the island of maui  with the initial increment expected to come on line in the timeframe 
heco and meco aos letters 
heco and meco have each requested from the puc an extension of time for filing its respective aos letter until march the additional time is required to assess the impact on heco s and meco s forecasts of the sales and peak load impact targets set in the eeps framework adopted by the puc in january these revised forecasts may reduce heco s and meco s estimates of future firm generating capacity requirements 
collective bargaining agreements 
see collective bargaining agreements in note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements 
legislation and regulation 
congress and the hawaii legislature periodically consider legislation that could have positive or negative effects on the utilities and their customers 
also see hawaii clean energy initiative and environmental regulation in note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements and recent tax developments above 
renewable energy 
in  a hawaii law was enacted that stated that the puc may consider the need for increased renewable energy in rendering decisions on utility matters 
due to this measure  it is possible that  if energy from a renewable source were more expensive than energy from fossil fuel  the puc may still approve the purchase of energy from the renewable source 
in  a hawaii law was enacted to promote and encourage the use of solar thermal energy 
this measure requires the installation of solar thermal water heaters in residences constructed after january   but allows for limited variances in cases where installation of solar water heating is deemed inappropriate 
the measure establishes standards for quality and performance of such systems 
also in  a hawaii law was enacted that is intended to facilitate the permitting of larger mw or greater renewable energy projects 
the energy agreement includes several undertakings by the utilities to integrate solar energy into the electric grid 
in  a bill became hawaii law act that authorizes preferential rates to agricultural energy producers selling electricity to utilities 
this will help support the long term development of locally grown biofuel crops  cultivating potential local renewable fuel sources for the utilities 
in addition  pursuant to act also adopted in  avoided cost is no longer a consideration in determining a just and reasonable rate for non fossil fuel generated electricity 
this will allow the utilities to negotiate purchased power prices for renewable energy that have the potential to be more stable and less costly than current pricing tied to avoided cost 
in  a hawaii law was enacted that gives the puc the authority to allow those electric utilities that aggregate their renewable portfolios to achieve the rps eg  heco  helco and meco to distribute the costs and expenses of renewable energy projects among those utilities 
the bill also allows the puc to establish a surcharge for such costs and expenses without a rate case filing 
also passed in  act provides for continued inclusion of customer sited  grid connected renewable energy generation in the rps calculations after this is the current practice in calculating rps levels  which provides electric utility ratepayers with a clear value from a program such as net energy metering 
biofuels 
in  a hawaii law was enacted with the stated purpose of encouraging further production and use of biofuels in hawaii 
it established that biofuel processing facilities in hawaii are a permitted use in designated agricultural districts and established a program with the hawaii department of agriculture to encourage the production in hawaii of energy feedstock ie  raw materials for biofuels 
in  a hawaii law was enacted that encourages the development of biofuels by authorizing the hawaii board of land and natural resources to lease public lands to growers or producers of plant and animal material used for the production of biofuels 
the utilities have agreed in the energy agreement to test the use of biofuels in their generating units and  if economically feasible  to connect them to the use of biofuels 
for its part  the state agrees to support this testing and conversion by expediting all necessary approvals and permitting

liquidity and capital resources 
management believes that heco s ability  and that of its subsidiaries  to generate cash  both internally from operations and externally from issuances of equity and debt securities  commercial paper and lines of credit  is adequate to maintain sufficient liquidity to fund their respective capital expenditures and investments and to cover debt  retirement benefits and other cash requirements in the foreseeable future 
heco s consolidated capital structure was as follows december dollars in millions short term borrowings long term debt  net preferred stock common stock equity heco s short term borrowings other than from helco and meco  heco s line of credit facility  the principal amount of sprbs that have been authorized by the hawaii legislature for future issuance by the state of hawaii department of budget and finance dbf for the benefit of the utilities and the principal amount of unsecured taxable obligations approved by the puc were as follows year ended december  in millions average balance end of period balance december  short term borrowings commercial paper line of credit draws borrowings from hei undrawn capacity under line of credit facility expiring december  special purpose revenue bonds authorized for issuance legislative authorization expiring june  heco helco meco total special purpose revenue bonds available for issuance unsecured taxable obligations approved by the puc for issuance on or before december  heco helco meco total unsecured taxable obligations available for issuance in the maximum amount of external short term borrowings in was million 
at december   heco had million and million of short term borrowings from helco and meco  respectively  which borrowings are eliminated in consolidation 
at february   heco had no outstanding commercial paper  its line of credit facility was undrawn  it had no borrowings from hei and it had borrowings of million and million from helco and meco  respectively 
heco utilizes short term debt  typically commercial paper  to support normal operations  to refinance short term debt and for other temporary requirements 
heco also borrows short term from hei for itself and on behalf of helco and meco  and heco may borrow from or loan to helco and meco short term 
the intercompany borrowings among the utilities  but not the borrowings from hei  are eliminated in the consolidation of heco s financial statements 
heco and its subsidiaries periodically utilize long term debt  historically borrowings of the proceeds of sprbs issued by the dbf to finance the utilities capital improvement projects  or to repay short term borrowings used to finance such projects 
the puc must approve issuances  if any  of equity and long term debt securities by heco  helco and meco 
heco has a line of credit facility of million 
see note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements 
the credit agreement  amended in december  contains provisions for revised pricing in the event of a ratings change 
for example  a ratings downgrade of heco s long term rating eg  from bbb baa to bbb baa by s p and moody s  respectively would result in a commitment fee increase of basis points and an interest rate increase of basis points on any drawn amounts 
on the other hand  a ratings upgrade eg  from bbb baa to bbb baa by s p or moody s  respectively would result in a commitment fee decrease of basis points and an interest rate decrease of basis points on any drawn amounts 
the agreement contains customary conditions that must be met in order to draw on it  including compliance with several covenants such as covenants preventing its subsidiaries from entering into agreements that restrict the ability of the subsidiaries to pay dividends to  or to repay borrowings from  heco  and restricting its ability as well as the ability of any of its subsidiaries to guarantee additional indebtedness of the subsidiaries if such additional debt would cause the subsidiary s consolidated subsidiary funded debt to capitalization ratio to exceed ratio of for helco and for meco as of december   as calculated under the agreement 
in addition to customary defaults  heco s failure to maintain its financial ratios  as defined in its agreement  or meet other requirements may result in an event of default 
for example  under its agreement  it is an event of default if heco fails to maintain a consolidated capitalization ratio equity of at least ratio of as of december   as calculated under the agreement  or if heco is no longer owned by hei 
in addition to their impact on pricing under heco s credit agreement  the ratings of heco s commercial paper and debt securities could significantly impact the ability of heco to sell its commercial paper and issue debt securities and or the cost of such debt 
the rating agencies use a combination of qualitative measures eg  assessment of business risk that incorporates an analysis of the qualitative factors such as management  competitive positioning  operations  markets and regulation as well as quantitative measures eg  cash flow  debt  interest coverage and liquidity ratios in determining the ratings of heco securities 
on august   moody s maintained heco s long term and short term commercial paper ratings and stable outlook  indicating that the ratings factor in the anticipated cash flow stability of this vertically integrated utility  the long term benefits of a more predictable regulatory framework being introduced  and a conservative financial management 
moody s indicated the rating could be downgraded if the hawaii puc does not follow through with the regulatory transformation contemplated under the hcei  including all elements of the decoupling mechanism or if the utilities cash flow to debt declined to below last twelve months as of march  latest reported by moody s on a sustainable basis and its cash flow coverage of interest fell below times times last twelve months as of march  latest reported by moody s 
on november   s p maintained its long term ratings for heco  helco and meco of bbb and stable outlook 
in addition  s p maintained its a short term rating and aggressive financial profile on heco 
s p indicated that although heco s consolidated credit profile has the potential to gradually improve through heco s decoupling and recently approved automatic rate adjustment mechanisms  the utilities had yet to make meaningful strides in closing the significant gap between their actual and authorized roace 
as of february   the s p and moody s ratings of heco securities were as follows s p moody s commercial paper a p special purpose revenue bonds insured principal amount noted in parentheses  senior unsecured  insured as follows ambac assurance corporation billion bbb baa financial guaranty insurance company billion bbb baa mbia insurance corporation billion bbb baa syncora guarantee inc formerly xl capital assurance inc

heco s consolidated cash flows from operating activities net income for common stock  adjusted for non cash income and expense items such as depreciation  amortization and deferred taxes  after the payment of common stock and preferred stock dividends  are currently not expected to provide sufficient cash to cover the forecasted net capital expenditures 
debt and equity financing are expected to be required to fund this estimated shortfall as well as to refinance maturing revenue bonds million in and million in and to fund any unanticipated expenditures not included in the through forecast  such as increases in the costs or acceleration of the construction of capital projects  unbudgeted acquisitions or investments in new businesses and significant increases in retirement benefit funding requirements

consolidated net capital expenditures for heco and subsidiaries for  and were million  million and million  respectively 
management periodically reviews capital expenditure estimates and the timing of construction projects 
these estimates may change significantly as a result of many considerations  including changes in economic conditions  changes in forecasts of kwh sales and peak load  the availability of purchased power and changes in expectations concerning the construction and ownership of future generation units  the availability of generating sites and transmission and distribution corridors  the need for fuel infrastructure investments  the ability to obtain adequate and timely rate increases  escalation in construction costs  commitments under the energy agreement  the effects of opposition to proposed construction projects and requirements of environmental and other regulatory and permitting authorities

hcei energy agreement 
heco  for itself and its subsidiaries  entered into the energy agreement on october  see hawaii clean energy initiative in note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements 
the far reaching nature of the energy agreement  including the extent of renewable energy commitments  present new increased risks to the company 
among such risks are the dependence on third party suppliers of renewable purchased energy  which if the utilities are unsuccessful in negotiating purchased power agreements with such ipps or if a major ipp fails to deliver the anticipated capacity in its purchased power agreement  could impact the utilities achievement of their commitments under the energy agreement and or the utilities ability to deliver reliable service  delays in acquiring or unavailability of non fossil fuel supplies for renewable generation  the impact of intermittent power to the electrical grid and reliability of service if appropriate supporting infrastructure is not installed or does not operate effectively  the likelihood that the utilities may need to make substantial investments in related infrastructure  which could result in increased borrowings and materially impact the financial condition and liquidity of the utilities  and the commitment to support a variety of initiatives  which  if approved by the puc  may have a material impact on the results of operations and financial condition of the utilities depending on their design and implementation 
these initiatives include  but are not limited to  decoupling revenues from sales  implementing feed in tariffs to encourage development of renewable energy  removing the system wide caps on net energy metering but studying dg interconnections on a per circuit basis  and developing an energy efficiency portfolio standard 
management cannot predict the ultimate impact or outcome of the implementation of these or other hcei programs on the results of operations  financial condition and liquidity of the electric utilities 
regulation of electric utility rates 
the rates the electric utilities are allowed to charge for their services  and the timeliness of permitted rate increases  are among the most important items influencing their results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
the puc has broad discretion over the rates the electric utilities charge and other matters 
any adverse decision by the puc concerning the level or method of determining electric utility rates  the items and amounts permitted to be included in rate base  the authorized returns on equity or rate base found to be reasonable  the potential consequences of exceeding or not meeting such returns  or any prolonged delay in rendering a decision in a rate or other proceeding could have a material adverse effect on the company s and heco s consolidated results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
upon a showing of probable entitlement  the puc is required to issue an interim d o in a rate case within months from the date of filing a completed application if the evidentiary hearing is completed subject to extension for days if the evidentiary hearing is not completed 
there is no time limit for rendering a final d o 
interim rate increases are subject to refund with interest  pending the final outcome of the case 
management cannot predict when the final d os in pending or future rate cases will be rendered or the amount of any interim or final rate increase that may be granted 
fuel oil and purchased power 
the electric utilities rely on fuel oil suppliers and ipps to deliver fuel oil and power  respectively 
see fuel contracts and power purchase agreements in note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company estimates that of the net energy generated and purchased by heco and its subsidiaries in will be generated from the burning of fossil fuel oil 
purchased kwhs provided approximately of the total net energy generated and purchased in  and failure or delay by the electric utilities oil suppliers and shippers to provide fuel pursuant to existing supply contracts  or failure by a major ipp to deliver the firm capacity anticipated in its ppa  could interrupt the ability of the electric utilities to deliver electricity  thereby materially adversely affecting the company s results of operations and financial condition 
heco generally maintains an average system fuel inventory level equivalent to days of forward consumption 
helco and meco generally maintain an inventory level equivalent to one month s supply of both medium sulfur fuel oil and diesel fuel 
some  but not all  of the electric utilities ppas require that the ipps maintain minimum fuel inventory levels and all of the firm capacity ppas include provisions imposing substantial penalties for failure to produce the firm capacity anticipated by those agreements 
other operation and maintenance expenses 
other o m expenses were essentially flat in and increased and for and  respectively  when compared to the prior year  and respectively  excluding dsm program expense 
o m expenses for the year are expected to be approximately higher than as the electric utilities expect to incur costs to facilitate the safe  reliable integration of more renewables to the separate island systems 
transmission and distribution expenses are also expected to increase consistent with the new asset management initiatives to modernize the infrastructure 
the timing and amount of expenses can vary as circumstances change 
for example  recent overhauls have been more expensive than in the past due to the larger scope of work necessary to maintain aging equipment 
also  the cost of overhauls can be higher than originally planned after full assessments of the repair work are performed 
heco s implementation of decoupling mechanisms has mitigated some of the negative net income impact of rising other o m expenses 
other regulatory and permitting contingencies 
many public utility projects require puc approval and various permits eg  environmental and land use permits from other agencies 
delays in obtaining puc approval or permits can result in increased costs 
if a project does not proceed or if the puc disallows costs of the project  the project costs may need to be written off in amounts that could have a material adverse effect on the company 
two major capital improvement utility projects  the keahole project consisting of ct  ct and st and the east oahu transmission project  encountered opposition and were seriously delayed before being placed in service  with a writedown being required for both the keahole and eotp projects 
see note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of additional regulatory contingencies 
competition 
although competition in the generation sector in hawaii has been moderated by the scarcity of generation sites  various permitting processes and lack of interconnections to other electric utilities  heco and its subsidiaries face competition from ipps and customer self generation  with or without cogeneration 
in october  the puc opened investigative proceedings on two specific issues competitive bidding and distributed generation dg to move toward a more competitive electric industry environment under cost based regulation 
competitive bidding proceeding 
in december  the puc issued a decision that included a final competitive bidding framework  which became effective immediately 
the final framework states  among other things  that a utility is required to use competitive bidding to acquire a future generation resource or a block of generation resources unless the puc finds bidding to be unsuitable  the framework does not apply in certain situations identified in the framework  waivers from competitive bidding for certain circumstances will be considered  the utility is required to select an independent observer from a list approved by the puc whenever the utility or its affiliate seeks to advance a project proposal ie  in competition with those offered by bidders  the utility may consider its own self bid proposals in response to generation needs identified in its rfp  and for any resource to which competitive bidding does not apply due to waiver or exemption  the utility retains its traditional obligation to offer to purchase capacity and energy from a qualifying facility qf at avoided cost upon reasonable terms and conditions approved by the puc 
management cannot currently predict the ultimate effect of the framework on the ability of the utilities to acquire or build additional generating capacity in the future 
the utilities received approval for waivers from the competitive framework to negotiate modifications to existing ppas that generate electricity from renewable resources 
also  certain renewable energy projects were grandfathered from the competitive bidding process 
the puc can also grant waivers on its own volition to renewable energy projects that are not exempt from the competitive bidding framework 
distributed generation proceeding 
in january  the puc issued a d o indicating that its policy is to promote the development of a market structure that assures dg is available at the lowest feasible cost  dg that is economical and reliable has an opportunity to come to fruition and dg that is not cost effective does not enter the system 
the d o affirmed the ability of the utilities to procure and operate dg for utility purposes at utility sites 
the puc also indicated its desire to promote the development of a competitive market for customer sited dg 
the d o allows the utility to provide dg services on a customer owned site as a regulated service when the dg resolves a legitimate system need  the dg is the lowest cost alternative to meet that need and it can be shown that  in an open and competitive process acceptable to the puc  the customer operator was unable to find another entity ready and able to supply the proposed dg service at a price and quality comparable to the utility s offering 
environmental matters 
the heco  helco and meco generating stations operate under air pollution control permits issued by the hawaii department of health doh and  in a limited number of cases  by the federal environmental protection agency epa 
the hawaii state legislature passed legislation that requires an environmental assessment for proposed waste to energy facilities  landfills  oil refineries  power generating facilities greater than mw and wastewater facilities  except individual wastewater systems 
meeting this requirement results in increased project costs 
the amendments to the clean air act caa  changes to the national ambient air quality standard naaqs for ozone  and adoption of a naaqs for fine particulate matter resulted in substantial changes for the electric utility industry 
further significant impacts may occur under newly adopted rules eg  one hour naaqs for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide  control of ghgs under the ghg psd and title v tailoring rule  under rules deemed applicable to the utilities facilities eg  regional haze rule  if currently proposed legislation  rules and standards are adopted eg  ghg emission reduction rules  or if new legislation  rules or standards are adopted in the future 
similarly  soon to be issued rules governing cooling water intake may significantly impact heco s steam generating facilities on oahu 
see environmental regulation in note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements 
there can be no assurance that a significant environmental liability will not be incurred by the electric utilities or that the related costs will be recoverable through rates 
additional environmental compliance costs are expected to be incurred as a result of the initiatives called for in the energy agreement  including permitting and siting costs for new facilities and testing and permitting costs related to changing to the use of biofuels 
management believes that the recovery through rates of most  if not all  of any costs incurred by heco and its subsidiaries in complying with environmental requirements would be allowed by the puc  but no assurance can be given that this will in fact be the case 
technological developments 
new technological developments eg  the commercial development of energy storage  dg and generation from renewable sources may impact the electric utility s future competitive position  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
material estimates and critical accounting policies 
also see material estimates and critical accounting policies for consolidated hei above 
property  plant and equipment 
property  plant and equipment are reported at cost 
self constructed electric utility plant includes engineering  supervision  and administrative and general costs  and an allowance for the cost of funds used during the construction period 
these costs are recorded in construction in progress and are transferred to property  plant and equipment when construction is completed and the facilities are either placed in service or become useful for public utility purposes 
upon the retirement or sale of electric utility plant  no gain or loss is recognized 
the cost of the plant retired is charged to accumulated depreciation 
amounts collected from customers for cost of removal expected to exceed salvage value in the future are included in regulatory liabilities 
heco and its subsidiaries evaluate the impact of applying lease accounting standards to their new ppas  ppa amendments and other arrangements they enter into 
a possible outcome of the evaluation is that an arrangement results in its classification as a capital lease  which could have a material effect on heco s consolidated balance sheet if a significant amount of capital assets of the ipp and lease obligations needed to be recorded 
management believes that the puc will allow recovery of property  plant and equipment in its electric rates 
if the puc does not allow recovery of any such costs  the electric utility would be required to write off the disallowed costs at that time 
see the discussion under major projects in note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements concerning costs of major projects that have not yet been approved for inclusion in the applicable utility s rate base 
regulatory assets and liabilities 
the electric utilities are regulated by the puc 
in accordance with accounting standards for regulatory operations  the company s financial statements reflect assets  liabilities  revenues and costs of heco and its subsidiaries based on current cost based rate making regulations 
the actions of regulators can affect the timing of recognition of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities 
regulatory liabilities represent amounts collected from customers for costs that are expected to be incurred in the future 
regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because their recovery in future customer rates is probable 
as of december   the consolidated regulatory liabilities and regulatory assets of the utilities amounted to million and million  respectively  compared to million and million as of december   respectively 
regulatory liabilities and regulatory assets are itemized in note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements 
management continually assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as changes in the applicable regulatory environment 
because current rates include the recovery of regulatory assets existing as of the last rate case and rates in effect allow the utilities to earn a reasonable rate of return  management believes that the recovery of the regulatory assets as of december  is probable 
this determination assumes continuation of the current political and regulatory climate in hawaii  and is subject to change in the future 
management believes heco and its subsidiaries operations currently satisfy the criteria for regulatory accounting 
if events or circumstances should change so that those criteria are no longer satisfied  the electric utilities expect that the regulatory assets would be charged to expense and the regulatory liabilities would be credited to income or refunded to ratepayers immediately 
in the event of unforeseen regulatory actions or other circumstances  however  management believes that a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial condition and liquidity may result if regulatory assets have to be charged to expense or if regulatory liabilities are required to be refunded to ratepayers immediately 
revenues 
electric utility revenues are based on rates authorized by the puc and include revenues applicable to energy consumed in the accounting period but not yet billed to customers 
as of december   revenues applicable to energy consumed  but not yet billed to customers  amounted to million 
revenue amounts recorded pursuant to a puc interim order are subject to refund  with interest  pending a final order 
the rate schedules of the electric utilities include ecacs under which electric rates are adjusted for changes in the weighted average price paid for fuel oil and certain components of purchased power  and the relative amounts of company generated power and purchased power 
the rate schedules of heco also include a ppac under which electric rates are more closely aligned with purchase power costs incurred 
management believes that a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial condition and liquidity may result if the ecacs or ppac were lost 
consolidation of variable interest entities 
a business enterprise must evaluate whether it should consolidate a variable interest entity vie 
the company evaluates the impact of applying accounting standards for consolidation to its relationships with ipps with whom the utilities execute new ppas or execute amendments of existing ppas 
a possible outcome of the analysis is that heco or its subsidiaries may be found to meet the definition of a primary beneficiary of a vie which finding may result in the consolidation of the ipp in heco s consolidated financial statements 
the consolidation of ipps could have a material effect on heco s consolidated financial statements  including the recognition of a significant amount of assets and liabilities  and  if such a consolidated ipp were operating at a loss and had insufficient equity  the potential recognition of such losses 
the utilities do not know how the consolidation of ipps would be treated for regulatory or credit ratings purposes

bank executive overview and strategy 
when asb was acquired by hei in  it was a traditional thrift with assets of billion and net income of about million 
asb has grown by both acquisition and internal growth  but has been optimizing its balance sheet in recent years as a result of its multi year performance improvement project  which has resulted in a reduction in asset size and a concomitant improvement in profitability and capital efficiency 
asb ended with assets of billion and net income of million  compared to assets of billion as of december  and net income of million in asb improved its interest rate risk by selling substantially all of its salable fixed rate residential loan production during and a portion of its fixed rate residential loan production in and into the secondary market 
a portion of the excess liquidity was used to pay off other borrowings that were maturing 
asb is a full service community bank serving both consumer and commercial customers 
in order to remain competitive and continue building core franchise value  asb continues to develop and introduce new products and services in order to meet the needs of those markets 
additionally  the banking industry is constantly changing and asb is making the investments in people and technology necessary to adapt and remain competitive 
asb s ongoing challenge is to continue to increase revenues and control expenses after the completion of its performance improvement project 
the interest rate environment and the quality of asb s assets will continue to impact its financial results 
asb continues to face a challenging interest rate environment 
the persistent  low level of interest rates and excess liquidity in the financial system have impacted the new loan production rates and made it challenging to find investments with adequate risk adjusted returns  which resulted in a negative impact on asb s asset yields and net interest margin 
the potential for compression of asb s margin when interest rates rise is an ongoing concern 
as part of its interest rate risk management process  asb uses simulation analysis to measure net interest income sensitivity to changes in interest rates see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
asb then employs strategies to limit the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income 
asb s key strategies include attracting and retaining low cost  core deposits  particularly those in non interest bearing transaction accounts  reducing the overall exposure to fixed rate residential mortgage loans and diversifying the loan portfolio with higher spread  shorter maturity loans or variable rate loans such as commercial  commercial real estate and consumer loans  managing costing liabilities to optimize cost of funds and manage interest rate sensitivity  and focusing new investments on shorter duration or variable rate securities 
although asb s loan quality improved in  there are still signs of financial stress in the hawaii and mainland markets 
the slowdown in the economy  both nationally and locally  had resulted in asb experiencing higher levels of loan delinquencies and losses  which were concentrated in the residential land portfolio and on the neighbor islands 
the residential land portfolio has declined  which has enabled asb to release some loan loss reserves on that portfolio 
although asb s provision for loan losses had decreased in compared to  it is still at an elevated level compared to several years of historically low loan losses and loan loss allowances 
while a gradual recovery was experienced in as the global economic recovery began to take hold  many challenges remain and the outlook for the hawaii economy is for a slow  steady recovery 
consumers and businesses are expected to recover slowly in as gradual improvement in measures such as job growth  unemployment and real personal income are expected 
continued financial stress on asb s customers may result in higher levels of loan delinquencies and losses

earning assets  costing liabilities and other factors 
earnings of asb depend primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between interest earned on earning assets and interest paid on costing liabilities 
the current interest rate environment is impacted by disruptions in the financial markets and these conditions may have a negative impact on asb s net interest margin 
loan originations and mortgage related securities are asb s primary sources of earning assets 
loan portfolio 
asb s loan volumes and yields are affected by market interest rates  competition  demand for financing  availability of funds and management s responses to these factors 
see note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements for the composition of asb s loans receivable 
the increase in the total loan portfolio from billion at the end of to billion at the end of was primarily due to growth in the commercial market and home equity line of credit loan portfolios  which asb targeted because of their shorter duration and variable rates 
loan portfolio risk elements 
when a borrower fails to make a required payment on a loan and does not cure the delinquency promptly  the loan is classified as delinquent 
if delinquencies are not cured promptly  asb normally commences a collection action  including foreclosure proceedings in the case of secured loans 
in a foreclosure action  the property securing the delinquent debt is sold at a public auction in which asb may participate as a bidder to protect its interest 
if asb is the successful bidder  the property is classified as real estate owned until it is sold 
see allowance for loan losses in note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements for information with respect to nonperforming assets 
the level of nonperforming loans reflects the impact of current unemployment levels in hawaii and the weak economic environment globally  nationally and in hawaii 
allowance for loan losses 
see allowance for loan losses in note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements for the tables which sets forth the allocation of asb s allowance for loan losses 
for  the allowance for loan losses decreased by million due to a lower historical loss ratio used for commercial loans and a decrease in loss reserves for residential land loans as a result of the contraction of the portfolio 
offsetting these decreases was an increase in the commercial real estate loan loss reserves due to an increase in the outstanding loan balance 
investment and mortgage related securities 
as of december   asb s investment portfolio consisted of mortgage related securities issued by federal national mortgage association fnma  federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc or government national mortgage association gnma  federal agency obligations and municipal bonds 
as of december   asb s investment portfolio consisted of mortgage related securities issued by fnma  fhlmc or gnma and federal agency obligations and municipal bonds 
principal and interest on mortgage related securities issued by fnma  fhlmc and gnma are guaranteed by the issuer  and the securities carry implied aaa ratings 
the unrealized gains on asb s investment in federal agency mortgage backed securities were primarily caused by lower interest rates 
the low interest rate environment coupled with tighter spreads on all mortgage collateralized securities caused the market value of the securities held to increase above the carrying book value

as of december   and  asb did not have any private issue mortgage related securities 
in the fourth quarter of  asb sold its pmrs portfolio and had no otti as of december  deposits and other borrowings 
deposits continue to be the largest source of funds for asb and are affected by market interest rates  competition and management s responses to these factors 
deposit retention and growth will remain challenging in the current environment due to competition for deposits and the low level of short term interest rates 
advances from the fhlb of seattle and securities sold under agreements to repurchase continue to be additional sources of funds

as of december   asb s costing liabilities consisted of deposits and other borrowings 
see note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements for the composition of asb s deposit liabilities and other borrowings 
other factors 
interest rate risk is a significant risk of asb s operations and also represents a market risk factor affecting the fair value of asb s investment securities 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in the fair value of those instruments  respectively 
in addition  changes in credit spreads also impact the fair values of those instruments 
as of december  and  asb had unrealized gains  net of taxes  on available for sale investments and mortgage related securities including securities pledged for repurchase agreements in aoci of million and million  respectively 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
legislation and regulation 
asb is subject to extensive regulation  principally by the office of the comptroller of the currency occ and the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 
depending on asb s level of regulatory capital and other considerations  these regulations could restrict the ability of asb to compete with other institutions and to pay dividends to its shareholder

dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank act 
regulation of the financial services industry  including regulation of hei and asb  has changed and will continue to change as a result of the enactment of the dodd frank act  which became law in july importantly for hei and asb  under the dodd frank act  on july   all of the functions of the office of thrift supervision ots transferred to the occ  the fdic  the federal reserve board frb and the consumer financial protection bureau 
supervision and regulation of hei  as a thrift holding company  moved to the frb  and supervision and regulation of asb  as a federally chartered savings bank  moved to the occ 
while the laws and regulations applicable to hei and asb did not generally change the home owners loan act and regulations issued thereunder still apply the applicable laws and regulations are being interpreted  and new and amended regulations may be adopted by the frb and the occ 
hei will for the first time be subject to minimum consolidated capital requirements  and asb may be required to be supervised through ashi  its intermediate holding company 
the dodd frank act requires regulators  at a minimum  to apply to bank and thrift holding companies leverage and risk based capital standards that are at least as strict as those in effect at the insured depository institution level on the date the act became effective  although there will be a phase in period for meeting these standards 
in addition  hei will continue to be required to serve as a source of strength to asb in the event of its financial distress 
the dodd frank act also imposes new restrictions on the ability of a savings bank to pay dividends should it fail to remain a qualified thrift lender 
more stringent affiliate transaction rules now apply to asb in the securities lending  repurchase agreement and derivatives areas 
standards were raised with respect to the ability of asb to merge with or acquire another institution 
in reviewing a potential merger or acquisition  the approving federal agency will need to consider the extent to which the proposed transaction will result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the us banking or financial system 
the dodd frank act establishes a consumer financial protection bureau bureau that will have authority to prohibit practices it finds to be unfair  deceptive or abusive  and it may also issue rules requiring specified disclosures and the use of new model forms 
asb may also be subject to new state regulation because of a provision in the dodd frank act 
asb may also be subject to new state regulation because of a provision in the dodd frank act that acknowledges that a federal savings bank may be subject to state regulation and allows federal law to preempt a state consumer financial law on a case by case basis only when the state law would have a discriminatory effect on the bank compared to that on a bank chartered in that state  the state law prevents or significantly interferes with a bank s exercise of its power  or the state law is preempted by another federal law 
the dodd frank act also adopts a number of provisions that will impact the mortgage industry  including the imposition of new specific duties on the part of mortgage originators such as asb to act in the best interests of consumers and to take steps to ensure that consumers will have the capability to repay loans they may obtain  as well as provisions imposing new disclosure requirements and requiring appraisal reforms 
regulations are required to be adopted within months after the date that is to be specified by the secretary of the treasury for the transfer of consumer protection power to the bureau 
the durbin amendment to the dodd frank act required the frb to issue rules to ensure that debit card interchange fees are reasonable and proportional to the processing costs incurred 
in june  the frb issued a final rule establishing standards for debit card interchange fees and prohibiting network exclusivity arrangements and routing restrictions 
under the final rule  effective october   the maximum permissible interchange fee that an issuer may receive for an electronic debit transaction is cents  depending on certain components 
for  asb had earned an average of cents per transaction 
as specified in the dodd frank act  these regulations will exempt banks like asb  that  along with their affiliates  have less than billion in assets 
however  market pressures could cause all banks to observe this limitation 
many of the provisions of the dodd frank act  as amended  will not become effective until implementing regulations are issued and effective 
thus  management cannot predict the ultimate impact of the dodd frank act  as amended  on the company or asb at this time 
nor can management predict the impact or substance of other future federal or state legislation or regulation  or the application thereof 
overdraft rules 
on november   the board of governors of the federal reserve system announced that it amended regulation e which implements the electronic fund transfer act to limit the ability of a financial institution to assess an overdraft fee for paying automated teller machine or one time debit card transactions that overdraw a consumer s account  unless the consumer affirmatively consents  or opts in  to the institution s payment of overdrafts for those transactions 
these new rules applied on july  for new accounts and on august  for existing accounts 
for  these types of overdraft fees were million lower compared to safe act 
under the secure and fair enforcement for mortgage licensing act and the final rules issued on july   residential mortgage loan originators employed by banks must register with the nationwide mortgage lending system and registry to obtain a unique identifier from the registry  and maintain that registration 
the initial period for this federal registration ended july   asb satisfied its obligations under this act before that deadline 
fhlb of seattle stock 
as of december   asb s investment in stock of the fhlb of seattle of million was carried at cost because it can only be redeemed at par 
there is a minimum required investment in such stock based on measurements of asb s capital  assets and or borrowing levels  and asb s investment is substantially in excess of that requirement 
the fhlb of seattle reported net income of million for the nine months ended september  compared to net income of million for the nine months ended september  the fhlb of seattle reported retained earnings of million as of september  and was in compliance with all of its regulatory capital requirements 
in october  the fhlb of seattle entered into a stipulation and consent to the issuance of a consent order with the federal housing finance agency  which requires the fhlb of seattle to take certain actions related to its business and operations 
the consents provide that  following a stabilization period and once the fhlb of seattle reaches and maintains certain thresholds  it may redeem or repurchase capital stock and begin paying dividends 
asb does not believe that the consents will affect the fhlb of seattle s ability to meet asb s liquidity and funding needs 
the fhlb of seattle did not pay any cash dividends in  or commitments and contingencies

liquidity and capital resources 
december change change dollars in millions total assets available for sale investment and mortgage related securities loans receivable held for investment  net deposit liabilities other bank borrowings as of december   asb was one of hawaii s largest financial institutions based on assets of billion and deposits of billion 
in august  moody s affirmed asb s counterparty credit rating of a with a stable outlook based on asb s excellent asset quality indicators  high capital ratios and healthy liquidity position that is supported by good core deposit funding 
in december  s p affirmed asb s issuer credit ratings of bbb stable a based on strong capital and earnings  moderate risk position  above average funding and adequate liquidity 
these ratings reflect only the view  at the time the ratings are issued  of the applicable rating agency from whom an explanation of the significance of such ratings may be obtained 
such ratings are not recommendations to buy  sell or hold any hei or heco securities  such ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agencies  and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
asb s principal sources of liquidity are customer deposits  borrowings and the maturity and repayment of portfolio loans and securities 
asb s deposits as of december  were million higher than december  asb s principal sources of borrowings are advances from the fhlb and securities sold under agreements to repurchase from broker dealers 
as of december   fhlb borrowings totaled million  representing of assets 
asb is approved to borrow from the fhlb up to of asb s assets to the extent it provides qualifying collateral and holds sufficient fhlb stock 
as of december   asb s unused fhlb borrowing capacity was approximately billion 
as of december   securities sold under agreements to repurchase totaled million  representing of assets 
asb utilizes deposits  advances from the fhlb and securities sold under agreements to repurchase to fund maturing and withdrawable deposits  repay maturing borrowings  fund existing and future loans and purchase investment and mortgage related securities 
as of december   asb had commitments to borrowers for undisbursed loan funds  loan commitments and unused lines and letters of credit of billion  including million to lend additional funds to borrowers whose loan terms have been modified in troubled debt restructurings 
management believes asb s current sources of funds will enable it to meet these obligations while maintaining liquidity at satisfactory levels 
as of december  and  asb had million and million of loans on nonaccrual status  respectively  or and of net loans outstanding  respectively 
as of december  and  asb had million and million  respectively  of real estate acquired in settlement of loans 
in  operating activities provided cash of million 
net cash of million was used by investing activities primarily due to purchases of investment and mortgage related securities  a net increase in loans held for investment and capital expenditures  partly offset by repayments of investment and mortgage related securities and proceeds from the sale of mortgage related securities and real estate 
financing activities provided net cash of million due to a net increase in deposits  partly offset by a decrease in other borrowings and the payment of common stock dividends 
asb believes that maintaining a satisfactory regulatory capital position provides a basis for public confidence  affords protection to depositors  helps to ensure continued access to capital markets on favorable terms and provides a foundation for growth 
fdic regulations restrict the ability of financial institutions that are not well capitalized to compete on the same terms as well capitalized institutions  such as by offering interest rates on deposits that are significantly higher than the rates offered by competing institutions 
as of december   asb was well capitalized see regulation capital requirements below for asb s capital ratios 
for a discussion of asb dividends  see common stock equity in note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements 
certain factors that may affect future results and financial condition 
also see forward looking statements and certain factors that may affect future results and financial condition for consolidated hei above 
competition 
the banking industry in hawaii is highly competitive 
asb is one of hawaii s largest financial institutions  based on total assets  and is in direct competition for deposits and loans  not only with larger institutions  but also with smaller institutions that are heavily promoting their services in certain niche areas  such as providing financial services to small and medium sized businesses  and national organizations offering financial services 
asb s main competitors are banks  savings associations  credit unions  mortgage brokers  finance companies and securities brokerage firms 
these competitors offer a variety of lending  deposit and investment products to retail and business customers 
the primary factors in competing for deposits are interest rates  the quality and range of services offered  marketing  convenience of locations  hours of operation and perceptions of the institution s financial soundness and safety 
to meet competition  asb offers a variety of savings and checking accounts at competitive rates  convenient business hours  convenient branch locations with interbranch deposit and withdrawal privileges at each branch and convenient automated teller machines 
asb also conducts advertising and promotional campaigns 
the primary factors in competing for first mortgage and other loans are interest rates  loan origination fees and the quality and range of lending and other services offered 
asb believes that it is able to compete for such loans primarily through the competitive interest rates and loan fees it charges  the type of mortgage loan programs it offers and the efficiency and quality of the services it provides to individual borrowers and the business community 
asb is a full service community bank serving both consumer and commercial customers and has been diversifying its loan portfolio from single family home mortgages to higher spread  shorter duration consumer  commercial and commercial real estate loans 
the origination of consumer  commercial and commercial real estate loans involves risks and other considerations different from those associated with originating residential real estate loans 
for example  the sources and level of competition may be different and credit risk is generally higher than for mortgage loans 
these different risk factors are considered in the underwriting and pricing standards and in the allowance for loan losses established by asb for its consumer  commercial and commercial real estate loans 
us capital markets and credit and interest rate environment 
volatility in us capital markets may negatively impact the fair values of investment and mortgage related securities held by asb 
as of december   the fair value and carrying value of the investment and mortgage related securities held by asb were billion 
asb s strategic sales of its private issue mortgage related securities in the fourth quarter of  substantially all of its salable residential loan production during and a portion of its residential loan production in and helped to reduce its exposure to credit risk and interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is a significant risk of asb s operations 
asb actively manages this risk  including managing the relationship of its interest sensitive assets to its interest sensitive liabilities 
persistent low levels of interest rates  weak loan demand  and excess liquidity in the financial system have made it challenging to find investments with adequate risk adjusted returns  resulting in declining loan balances and an increase in asb s liquidity position  with a negative impact on asb s asset yields and net interest margin 
if the current interest rate environment persists  the potential for compression of asb s net interest margin will continue 
asb also manages the credit risk associated with its lending and securities portfolios  but a deep and prolonged recession led by a material decline in housing prices could materially impair the value of its portfolios 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk below 
technological developments 
new technological developments eg  significant advances in internet banking may impact asb s future competitive position  results of operations and financial condition 
environmental matters 
prior to extending a loan collateralized by real property  asb conducts due diligence to assess whether or not the property may present environmental risks and potential cleanup liability 
in the event of default and foreclosure of a loan  asb may become the owner of the mortgaged property 
for that reason  asb seeks to avoid lending upon the security of  or acquiring through foreclosure  any property with significant potential environmental risks  however  there can be no assurance that asb will successfully avoid all such environmental risks 
regulation 
asb is subject to examination and comprehensive regulation by the department of treasury  occ and the fdic  and is subject to reserve requirements established by the board of governors of the federal reserve system 
regulation by these agencies focuses in large measure on the adequacy of asb s capital and the results of periodic safety and soundness examinations conducted by the occ 
capital requirements 
the occ  which is asb s principal regulator  administers two sets of capital standards minimum regulatory capital requirements and prompt corrective action requirements 
the fdic also has prompt corrective action capital requirements 
as of december   asb was in compliance with occ minimum regulatory capital requirements and was well capitalized within the meaning of occ prompt corrective action regulations and fdic capital regulations  as follows asb met applicable minimum regulatory capital requirements noted in parentheses as of december  with a tangible capital ratio of  a core capital ratio of and a total risk based capital ratio of 
asb met the capital requirements to be generally considered well capitalized noted in parentheses as of december  with a leverage ratio of  a tier risk based capital ratio of and a total risk based capital ratio of the purpose of the prompt corrective action capital requirements is to establish thresholds for varying degrees of oversight and intervention by regulators 
declines in levels of capital  depending on their severity  will result in increasingly stringent mandatory and discretionary regulatory consequences 
capital levels may decline for any number of reasons  including reductions that would result if there were losses from operations  deterioration in collateral values or the inability to dispose of real estate owned such as by foreclosure 
the regulators have substantial discretion in the corrective actions they might direct and could include restrictions on dividends and other distributions that asb may make to hei through ashi and the requirement that asb develop and implement a plan to restore its capital 
under an agreement with regulators entered into by hei when it acquired asb  hei currently could be required to contribute to asb up to an additional million of capital  if necessary  to maintain asb s capital position 
examinations 
asb is subject to periodic safety and soundness examinations and other examinations by the occ 
in conducting its examinations  the occ utilizes the uniform financial institutions rating system adopted by the federal financial institutions examination council  which system utilizes the camels criteria for rating financial institutions 
the six components in the rating system are capital adequacy  asset quality  management  earnings  liquidity and sensitivity to market risk 
the occ examines and rates each camels component 
an overall camels rating is also given  after taking into account all of the component ratings 
a financial institution may be subject to formal regulatory or administrative direction or supervision such as a memorandum of understanding or a cease and desist order following an examination if its camels rating is not satisfactory 
an institution is prohibited from disclosing the occ s report of its safety and soundness examination or the component and overall camels rating to any person or organization not officially connected with the institution as an officer  director  employee  attorney  or auditor  except as provided by regulation 
the occ also regularly examines asb s information technology practices and its performance under community reinvestment act measurement criteria 
the federal deposit insurance act  as amended  addresses the safety and soundness of the deposit insurance system  supervision of depository institutions and improvement of accounting standards 
pursuant to this act  federal banking agencies have promulgated regulations that affect the operations of asb and its holding companies eg  standards for safety and soundness  real estate lending  accounting and reporting  transactions with affiliates and loans to insiders 
fdic regulations restrict the ability of financial institutions that fail to meet relevant capital measures to engage in certain activities  such as offering interest rates on deposits that are significantly higher than the rates offered by competing institutions 
as of december   asb was well capitalized and thus not subject to these restrictions 
qualified thrift lender status 
asb is a qualified thrift lender qtl under its federal thrift charter and  in order to maintain this status  asb is required to maintain at least of its assets in qualified thrift investments  which include housing related loans including mortgage related securities as well as certain small business loans  education loans  loans made through credit card accounts and a basket not exceeding of total assets of other consumer loans and other assets 
institutions that fail to maintain qtl status are subject to various penalties  including limitations on their activities 
in asb s case  the activities of hei  ashi and hei s other subsidiaries would also be subject to restrictions if asb failed to maintain its qtl status  and a failure or inability to comply with those restrictions could effectively result in the required divestiture of asb 
as of december   approximately of asb s assets were qualified thrift investments 
unitary savings and loan holding company 
the gramm leach bliley act of gramm act permitted banks  insurance companies and investment firms to compete directly against each other  thereby allowing one stop shopping for an array of financial services 
although the gramm act further restricted the creation of so called unitary savings and loan holding companies ie  companies such as hei whose subsidiaries include one or more savings associations and one or more nonfinancial subsidiaries  the unitary savings and loan holding company relationship among hei  ashi and asb is grandfathered under the gramm act so that hei and its subsidiaries will be able to continue to engage in their current activities so long as asb maintains its qtl status 
under the gramm act  any proposed sale of asb would have to satisfy applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and potential acquirers of asb would most likely be limited to companies that are already qualified as  or capable of qualifying as  either a traditional savings and loan association holding company or a bank holding company  or as one of the newly authorized financial holding companies permitted under the gramm act 
there have been legislative proposals in the past which would operate to eliminate the thrift charter or the grandfathered status of hei as a unitary thrift holding company and effectively require the divestiture of asb 
material estimates and critical accounting policies 
also see material estimates and critical accounting policies for consolidated hei above 
investment and mortgage related securities 
asb owns federal agency obligations and mortgage related securities issued by the fnma  gnma and fhlmc and municipal bonds  all of which are classified as available for sale and reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in aoci 
asb views the determination of whether an investment security is temporarily or other than temporarily impaired as a critical accounting policy since the estimate is susceptible to significant change from period to period because it requires management to make significant judgments  assumptions and estimates in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
see investment and mortgage related securities in note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of securities impairment assessment and other than temporary impaired securities 
prices for investments and mortgage related securities are provided by an independent third party pricing service and are based on observable inputs  including historical trading levels or sector yields  using market based valuation techniques 
the price of these securities is generally based on observable inputs  which includes market liquidity  credit considerations of the underlying collateral  the levels of interest rates  expectations of prepayments and defaults  limited investor base  market sector concerns and overall market psychology 
to validate the accuracy and completeness of security pricing  a separate third party pricing service is used on a quarterly basis to compare prices that were received from the initial third party pricing service 
if the pricing differential between the two pricing sources exceeds an established threshold  the security price will be re evaluated by sending a re pricing request to both independent third party pricing services  to another third party vendor  or to an independent broker to determine the most accurate price based on all observable inputs found in the market place 
the third party price selected will be based on the value that best reflects the data and observable characteristics of the security 
as of december   asb had investment and mortgage related securities issued by fhlmc  gnma and fnma valued at billion 
allowance for loan losses 
see note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements and the discussion above under earning assets  costing liabilities and other factors 
as of december   asb s allowance for loan losses was million and asb had million of loans on nonaccrual status  compared to million and million at december   respectively 
in  asb recorded a provision for loan losses of million 
the determination of the allowance for loan losses is sensitive to the credit risk ratings assigned to asb s loan portfolio and loss ratios inherent in the asb loan portfolio at any given point in time 
a sensitivity analysis provides insight regarding the impact that adverse changes in credit risk ratings may have on asb s allowance for loan losses 
at december   in the event that of the homogenous loans move down one delinquency classification eg  of the loans in the days delinquent category move to the days delinquent category  of the loans in the days delinquent category move to the days delinquent category and of the loans in the days delinquent category move to the days delinquent category and of non homogenous loans were downgraded one credit risk rating category for each category eg  of the loans in the pass category moved to the special mention category  of the loans in the special mention category moved to the substandard category  of the loans in the substandard category moved to the doubtful category and of the loans in the doubtful category moved to the loss category  the allowance for loan losses would have increased by approximately million 
the sensitivity analyses do not imply any expectation of future deterioration in asb loans risk ratings and they do not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the allowance for loan losses due to the numerous quantitative and qualitative factors considered in determining asb s allowance for loan losses 
the example above is only one of a number of possible scenarios 
although management believes asb s allowance for loan losses is adequate  the actual loan losses  provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses may be materially different if conditions change eg  if there is a significant change in the hawaii economy or real estate market  and material increases in those amounts could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
heco the information required by this item is set forth in heco s md a  incorporated herein by reference to page of heco exhibit item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk hei the company manages various market risks in the ordinary course of business  including credit risk and liquidity risk 
the company believes the electric utility and the other segment s exposures to these two risks are not material as of december  credit risk for asb is the risk that borrowers or issuers of securities will not be able to repay their obligations to the bank 
credit risk associated with asb s lending portfolios is controlled through its underwriting standards  loan rating of commercial and commercial real estate loans  on going monitoring by loan officers  credit review and quality control functions in these lending areas and adequate allowance for loan losses 
credit risk associated with the securities portfolio is mitigated through investment portfolio limits  experienced staff working with analytical tools  monthly fair value analysis and on going monitoring and reporting such as investment watch reports and loss sensitivity analysis 
see allowance for loan losses above 
liquidity risk for asb is the risk that the bank will not meet its obligations when they become due 
liquidity risk is mitigated by asb s asset liability management process  on going analytical analysis  monitoring and reporting information such as weekly cash flow analyses and maintenance of liquidity contingency plans 
the company is exposed to some commodity price risk primarily related to the fuel supply and ipp contracts of the electric utilities 
the company s commodity price risk is substantially mitigated so long as the electric utilities have their current ecacs in their rate schedules 
the company currently has no hedges against its commodity price risk 
the company currently has no exposure to market risk from trading activities nor foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the company considers interest rate risk to be a very significant market risk as it could potentially have a significant effect on the company s results of operations  financial condition and liquidity  especially as it relates to asb  but also as it may affect the discount rate used to determine retirement benefit liabilities  the market value of retirement benefit plans assets and the electric utilities allowed rates of return 
interest rate risk can be defined as the exposure of the company s earnings to adverse movements in interest rates 
bank interest rate risk the company s success is dependent  in part  upon asb s ability to manage interest rate risk 
asb s interest rate risk profile is strongly influenced by its primary business of making fixed rate residential mortgage loans and taking in retail deposits 
large mismatches in the amounts or timing between the maturity or repricing of interest sensitive assets or liabilities could adversely affect asb s earnings and the market value of its interest sensitive assets and liabilities in the event of significant changes in the level of interest rates 
many other factors also affect asb s exposure to changes in interest rates  such as general economic and financial conditions  customer preferences  and competition for loans or deposits 
asb s asset liability management committee alco  whose voting members are officers and employees of asb  is responsible for managing interest rate risk and carrying out the overall asset liability management objectives and activities of asb as approved by the asb board of directors 
alco establishes policies under which management monitors and coordinates asb s assets and liabilities 
see note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the use of rate lock commitments on loans held for sale and forward sale contracts to manage some interest rate risk associated with asb s residential loan sale program 
management of asb measures interest rate risk using simulation analysis with an emphasis on measuring changes in net interest income nii and the market value of interest sensitive assets and liabilities in different interest rate environments 
the simulation analysis is performed using a dedicated asset liability management software system enhanced with a mortgage prepayment model and a collateralized mortgage obligation database 
the simulation software is capable of generating scenario specific cash flows for all instruments using the specified contractual information for each instrument and product specific prepayment assumptions for mortgage loans and mortgage related securities 
nii sensitivity analysis measures the change in asb s twelve month  pretax nii in alternate interest rate scenarios 
nii sensitivity is measured as the change in nii in the alternate interest rate scenarios as a percentage of the base case nii 
the base case interest rate scenario is established using the current yield curve and assumes interest rates remain constant over the next twelve months 
the alternate scenarios are created by assuming rate ramps or gradual interest changes and accomplished by moving the yield curve in a parallel fashion  over the next twelve month period  in increments of basis points 
the simulation model forecasts scenario specific principal and interest cash flows for the interest bearing assets and liabilities  and the nii is calculated for each scenario 
key balance sheet modeling assumptions used in the nii sensitivity analysis include the size of the balance sheet remains relatively constant over the simulation horizon and maturing assets or liabilities are reinvested in similar instruments in order to maintain the current mix of the balance sheet 
in addition  assumptions are made about the prepayment behavior of mortgage related assets  future pricing spreads for new assets and liabilities  and the speed and magnitude with which deposit rates change in response to changes in the overall level of interest rates 
other nii sensitivity analysis may include scenarios such as yield curve twists or non static balance sheet changes such as changes to key balance sheet drivers 
for  asb adopted terminology and interest rate risk irr assessment  measurement and management practices consistent with occ guidelines 
the market value or economic capitalization of asb is now measured as economic value of equity eve replacing the ots net portfolio value npv ratio and sensitivity measures 
eve is a similar measurement conceptually as npv and represents the theoretical market value of asb s net worth and is defined as the present value of expected net cash flows from existing assets minus the present value of expected cash flows from existing liabilities plus the present value of expected net cash flows from existing off balance sheet contracts 
key assumptions used in the calculation of asb s eve include the prepayment behavior of loans and investments  the possible distribution of future interest rates  pricing spreads for assets and liabilities in the alternate scenarios and the rate and balance behavior of deposit accounts with indeterminate maturities 
eve is calculated in multiple scenarios 
as with the nii simulation  the base case is represented by the current yield curve 
alternate scenarios are created by assuming immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve in increments of basis points bp up to bp 
the change in eve is measured as the change in eve in a given rate scenario from the base case and expressed as a percentage 
to gain further insight into the irr profile  additional analysis is periodically performed in alternate scenarios including rate shifts of greater magnitude  yield curve twists and changes in key balance sheet drivers 
asb s interest rate risk sensitivity measures as of december  and constitute forward looking statements and were as follows december change in interest rates change in nii change in eve change in nii change in eve basis points gradual change instantaneous change gradual change instantaneous change base results for were restated from npv ratio sensitivity to change in eve for comparative purposes 
management believes that asb s interest rate risk position as of december  represents a reasonable level of risk 
the nii profile under the rising interest rate scenarios is less liability sensitive as of december  compared to december  due to changes in the deposit mix and assumptions 
in the scenario  the increase in nii is due to the effect of rate floors on certain loans in asb s portfolio 
the interest income benefit from the rate increases is not fully realized in this scenario until the rate on certain loans exceeds their floors 
asb s base eve was approximately million as of december  compared to million as of december  due to the higher relative value of the mortgage portfolio and changes in assumptions about the behavior of core deposits 
the change in eve was less sensitive in the rising scenarios as of december  compared to december  as the asset mix shifted from longer duration residential loans and investments to shorter duration consumer and commercial loans  changes in core deposit assumptions and the large drop in rates during  which shortened the duration of mortgage related assets 
the computation of the prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes on the nii sensitivity and the percentage change in eve is based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan prepayments  balance changes and pricing strategies  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
to the extent market conditions and other factors vary from the assumptions used in the simulation analysis  actual results may differ materially from the simulation results 
furthermore  nii sensitivity analysis measures the change in asb s twelve month  pretax nii in alternate interest rate scenarios  and is intended to help management identify potential exposures in asb s current balance sheet and formulate appropriate strategies for managing interest rate risk 
the simulation does not contemplate any actions that asb management might undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
further  the changes in nii vary in the twelve month simulation period and are not necessarily evenly distributed over the period 
these analyses are for analytical purposes only and do not represent management s views of future market movements  the level of future earnings  or the timing of any changes in earnings within the twelve month analysis horizon 
the actual impact of changes in interest rates on nii will depend on the magnitude and speed with which rates change  actual changes in asb s balance sheet  and management s responses to the changes in interest rates 
other than bank interest rate risk the company s general policy is to manage other than bank interest rate risk through use of a combination of short term debt  long term debt currently fixed rate debt and preferred securities 
as of december   management believes the company is exposed to other than bank interest rate risk because of its periodic borrowing requirements  the impact of interest rates on the discount rate and the market value of plan assets used to determine retirement benefits expenses and obligations see retirement benefits in hei s md a and note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements and the possible effect of interest rates on the electric utilities allowed rates of return see electric utility certain factors that may affect future results and financial condition regulation of electric utility rates
