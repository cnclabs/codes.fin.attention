item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion may contain forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results and the timing of selected events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of several factors  including those set forth under item a risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
unless otherwise stated  references in this report to particular years or quarters refer to our fiscal year and the associated quarters of those fiscal years 
overview we were incorporated in california in under the name omnicell technologies  inc and reincorporated in delaware in as omnicell  inc our healthcare automation solutions are designed to enable healthcare facilities to acquire  manage  dispense and administer medications and medical and surgical supplies  and are intended to enhance patient safety  reduce medication errors  improve workflow and increase operational efficiency 
we sell our medication dispensing and supply automation systems primarily in the united states 
approximately of our product revenue is from outside the united states and canada  although we believe adoption of our products internationally will increase in future years 
our sales force is organized by geographic region in the united states and canada 
we also sell through distributors in asia  australia  europe  the middle east and south america 
we have not sold and have no future plans to sell our products either directly or indirectly to customers located in countries that are identified as state sponsors of terrorism by the us department of state  or those subject to economic sanctions and export controls 
in  we manufactured the majority of our systems in our california facility and refurbishment and spare parts activities were conducted in our illinois facility 
in general  we recognize revenue when our systems are installed 
installation for our products generally takes place two weeks to nine months after our systems are ordered 
the installation process at our customers sites includes internal procedures associated with integrating large capital expenditures and time associated with adopting new technologies 
given the length of time necessary for our customers to plan for and complete the installation of our systems  our focus is on shipping products based on the installation dates requested by our customers and working at the customer s pace 
the amount of revenue recognized in future periods may depend on  among other things  the terms and timing of lease contract renewals  timing of customer installations  additional product sales and the size of such transactions 
we believe that future revenue will be affected by the competitiveness of our products and services 
our revenue increased by from million in to million in of the million increase in revenues from to  million was attributable to an increase in product revenues for as compared with  reflecting increased completed installations of our new automation products  increases in lease renewals from existing customers and a full year of revenues derived from our acquisition of pandora data systems  inc at the end of the third quarter of service revenues increased by million in as compared with  primarily due to growth in the installed customer base 
we believe that economic conditions are improving and that spending in the healthcare industry and demand for our products will increase in the future 
we believe that demand for our products in future periods will be based on our expectation that the overall market demand for healthcare services will increase as the population grows  life expectancies continue to increase  the quality of healthcare services increases and the availability of healthcare services increases  
table of contents our expectation that the environment of increased patient safety awareness  increased regulatory control and increased need for workflow efficiency through the adoption of technology in the healthcare industry will make our solutions a priority in the capital budgets of healthcare facilities  our continued ability to differentiate ourselves through a strategy intended to provide the best customer experience in the healthcare industry  and our delivery of industry leading products with differentiated product features that are designed to appeal to nurses  pharmacists  supply chain managers  chief information officers and hospital management 
we expect to operate through with our backlog within our objective of the next six to nine months of product revenue but we believe there will be variation from time to time 
our product backlog  consisting of orders accepted but not yet installed  increased from million as of december  to million at december  our key business strategies include delivering solutions that are designed to provide our customers with the best experience in the healthcare industry by proactively anticipating and meeting customer product and service requirements  listening carefully to our customers prospective issues  and meeting and exceeding our customers installation and support needs 
further penetrating the existing market for our products through sustaining technological leadership in our products by consistently innovating our product and service offerings  and maintaining our flexibility in customer product design and in the installation process 
increasing penetration of the international market by bringing new products and technologies to market that are specific to international markets  partnering with companies that have sales  distribution  or other capabilities that we do not possess in non us geographies  and increasing customer awareness of safety issues in the administration of medications 
expanding our product offering through acquisitions and partnerships 
in order to implement these strategies during  we did the following increased our sales organization to expand coverage of our growing installed base and to expand our reach to new customers  introduced eleven new products to market through our g launch  achieved modular certification for meaningful use of an ehr  which allows chief information officers to meet new regulations and take advantage of government incentives  and expanded into the chinese market after an extensive trial of our mandarin language system in peking union medical center hospital in beijing 
our healthcare customers expect a high degree of partnership from their technology suppliers 
omnicell provides extensive installation planning and consulting as part of every product sale 
our customers medication control systems are mission critical to their success and our customers require 
table of contents these systems to be functional at all times 
to help assure the maximum availability of our systems  our customers purchase maintenance and support contracts in one  two or five year increments 
our long term liabilities  which were million as of december  and million as of december   are principally composed of long term deferred service revenue  which was million as of december   and million as of december  our deferred service revenue will be amortized to service revenue as the service contracts are executed 
in  we generated positive overall cash flow of million 
this was primarily due to our million of net income  adjusted for non cash expenses associated with depreciation and amortization of million  share based compensation of million and million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase and stock option plans 
additional factors were strong cash collections  reducing accounts receivable at year end by million as compared to and increases of million of deferred service revenue and million of deferred gross profit 
these increases to cash were offset by a million increase in inventory  primarily related to the g launch  million for the acquisition and development of productive long lived assets and million in stock repurchases 
in  we generated positive overall cash flow of million  primarily due to improved net income  adjusted for non cash expenses associated with depreciation  amortization and share based compensation  and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase and stock option plans 
the increases to cash were offset by million in investing cash outflows for purchases of short term investments  the acquisition of pandora  and the acquisition and development of productive long lived assets 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by operations continued to be positive at million  and our cash and cash equivalents balance plus short term investments as of december  was million as compared to million at december  we expect cash provided by operations to remain positive in our full time headcount of on december  increased by net positions from our full time headcount on december  the net increase included rebalancing of the functional mix  with the majority of the net increase in sales and marketing 
we record compensation expense from our share based awards  options and our employee stock purchase plan in accordance with account standards codification  or asc   stock compensation 
total share based compensation expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million in our gross profit increased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   with gross margins increasing by percentage points to 
the increases in gross profits and related margins were driven primarily by a shift in product mix to higher margin products including a significant volume of lease renewal activity  overall manufacturing efficiencies and higher service revenues without a proportional increase in costs 
we expect revenues to increase modestly in and we do not anticipate any major fluctuations in our gross margin beyond normal fluctuations caused by changes in product mix 
revenues and gross margins may be adversely affected  however  as a result of unforeseen market price reductions and additional costs to expand our business 
net income increased to million in compared to million in due to an increase in gross profit of million  which included an million increase in gross profit from product revenues and million from service revenues 
this increase was partially offset by an million increase in operating expenses primarily due to an increase in selling  general and administrative of million and an increase in research and development activities of million 
partially offsetting these increases in was the absence of pretax restructuring charges compared to million in for facilities consolidation 

table of contents we operate in one business segment  the design  manufacturing  selling and servicing of medication and supply dispensing systems 
our chief operating decision maker  who is our chief executive officer  along with our management team evaluates our profit performance based on company wide  consolidated results 
the september acquisition of pandora resulted in neither the creation of a new reporting unit nor a new operating segment 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we regularly review our estimates and assumptions  which are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
we earn revenues from sales of our medication and supply dispensing systems  with related services  sold in our principal market the healthcare industry 
our market is primarily located in the united states 
our customer arrangements typically include one or more of the following deliverables products software enabled equipment that manages and regulates the storage and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and other medical supplies 
software additional software applications that enable incremental functionality of our equipment 
installation installation of equipment as integrated systems at customers sites 
post installation technical support phone support  on site service  parts and access to unspecified software upgrades and enhancements  if and when available 
professional services other customer services  such as training and consulting 
we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete  based upon our evaluation of whether the following four criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
we use signed customer contracts and signed customer purchase orders as evidence of an arrangement for leases and sales 
for service engagements  we use a signed services agreement and a statement of work to evidence an arrangement 
delivery has occurred 
equipment and software product delivery is deemed to occur upon successful installation and receipt of a signed and dated customer confirmation of installation letter  providing evidence that we have delivered what the customer ordered 
in instances of a customer self installation  product delivery is deemed to have occurred upon receipt of a signed and dated customer confirmation letter 
if a sale does not require installation  we recognize revenue on delivery of products to the customer  including transfer of title and risk of loss assuming all other revenue criteria are met 
we recognize revenue from sales of products to distributors upon delivery assuming all other revenue criteria are met since we do not allow for rights of return or refund 
assuming all other revenue criteria are met  we recognize revenue for 
table of contents support services ratably over the related support services contract period 
we recognize revenue on training and professional services as they are performed 
fee is fixed or determinable 
we assess whether a fee is fixed or determinable at the outset of the arrangement based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
we have established a history of collecting under the original contract without providing concessions on payments  products or services 
collection is probable 
we assess the probability of collecting from each customer at the outset of the arrangement based on a number of factors  including the customer s payment history and its current creditworthiness 
if  in our judgment  collection of a fee is not probable  we defer the revenue until the uncertainty is removed  which generally means revenue is recognized upon our receipt of cash payment assuming all other revenue criteria are met 
our historical experience has been that collection from our customers is generally probable 
in arrangements with multiple deliverables  assuming all other revenue criteria are met  we recognize revenue for individual delivered items if they have value to the customer on a standalone basis 
effective for new or modified arrangements entered into beginning on january   we allocate arrangement consideration at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
we adopted the new revenue recognition guidance for arrangements with multiple deliverables on a prospective basis as of january  this method requires us to determine the selling price at which each deliverable could be sold if it were sold regularly on a standalone basis 
when available  we use vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe of fair value as the selling price 
vsoe represents the price charged for a deliverable when it is sold separately or for a deliverable not yet being sold separately  the price established by management with the relevant authority 
we consider vsoe to exist when approximately or more of our standalone sales of an item are priced within a reasonably narrow pricing range plus or minus of the median rates 
we have established vsoe of fair value for our post installation technical support services and professional services 
when vsoe of fair value is not available  third party evidence  or tpe  of fair value for similar products and services is acceptable  however  our offerings and market strategy differ from those of our competitors  such that we cannot obtain sufficient comparable information about third parties prices 
if neither vsoe nor tpe are available  we use our best estimates of selling prices  or besp 
we determine besp considering factors such as market conditions  sales channels  internal costs and product margin objectives and pricing practices 
we regularly review and update our vsoe  tpe and besp information and obtain formal approval by appropriate levels of management 
the relative selling price method allocates total arrangement consideration proportionally to each deliverable on the basis of its estimated selling price 
in addition  the amount recognized for any delivered items cannot exceed that which is not contingent upon delivery of any remaining items in the arrangement 
we also use the residual method of allocating the arrangement consideration in certain circumstances 
we use the residual method to allocate total arrangement consideration between delivered and undelivered items for any arrangements entered into prior to january  and not subsequently materially modified 
the use of the residual method is required by software revenue recognition rules that applied to sales of most of our products and services until the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance 
we also use the residual method to allocate revenue between the software products that enable incremental equipment functionality and thus are not deemed to deliver their essential functionality  and the related post installation technical support  as these products and services continue to be accounted for under software revenue recognition rules 
under the residual method  the amount allocated to the undelivered elements equals vsoe of fair value of these elements 
any remaining amounts are attributed to the delivered items and are recognized when those items are delivered 

table of contents the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance did not result in changes in what we identify as the individual deliverables to which revenue is allocated  or the timing of revenue recognition related to these individual deliverables 
the change in the allocation method from residual to relative selling price did not have a material impact on our financial statements during year ended december  in addition  there is a time lag between when we receive a signed customer purchase order or contract and when we install the products  sometimes as long as one year or more  primarily due to the installation cycles and timing preferences of our customers 
as a result  only about half of the product revenue we recognized during year ended december  was subject to the new revenue recognition guidance 
in future periods  we anticipate the cumulative impact of the adoption may increase  as additional arrangements become subject to the new revenue recognition guidance 
however  the specific adjustments for any future period are not predictable  as they depend on the timing of our backlog shipments and installations and the nature of the orders we receive from new customers 
a portion of our sales are made through multi year lease agreements 
we recognize product related revenue under sales type leases  net of lease execution costs such as post installation product maintenance and technical support  at the net present value of the lease payment stream once our installation obligations have been met 
we optimize cash flows by selling a majority of our non us government leases to third party leasing finance companies on a non recourse basis 
we have no obligation to the leasing company once the lease has been sold 
some of our sales type leases  mostly those relating to us government hospitals  are retained in house 
interest income in these leases is recognized in product revenue using the interest method 
provision for allowances 
we continually monitor and evaluate the collectability of our trade receivables and our net investment in sales type leases based on a combination of factors 
we record specific allowances for doubtful accounts when we become aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligation to us such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration of financial position 
estimates are used in determining our allowances for all other customers based on factors such as current trends  the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience 
valuation and impairment of goodwill  other intangible assets and other long lived assets 
we account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other 
for the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and intangibles resulting from business acquisitions  we use the guidance in asc  business combinations 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized 
rather  they are tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may be impaired 
we perform our goodwill impairment tests during the fourth quarter of each year and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
to perform the goodwill impairment test  we determine the fair value of the reporting unit and compare the fair value to the reporting unit s carrying value 
we believe we are one reporting unit  and therefore  we compare our fair value to the total net asset value on our balance sheet 
if our total net asset value were to exceed our fair value  we would perform the second step of the impairment test 
in the second step  we would compare the implied fair value of our goodwill to our carrying amount  taking a write down to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value 
if our fair value exceeds the carrying value of our net assets under step one  then no impairment is indicated and the test is complete 
we passed the first step of our annual impairment test for in addition  there were no indicators of impairment as of december  
table of contents we continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long lived assets may not be recoverable 
we review long lived assets and certain purchased intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we will not be able to recover the asset s carrying amount 
recoverability of an asset is measured by comparing its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of that asset  excluding future interest costs that would be recognized as an expense when incurred 
any impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair market value 
significant management judgment is required in identifying a triggering event that arises from a change in circumstances  forecasting future operating results  and estimating the proceeds from the disposition of long lived or intangible assets 
in future periods  material impairment charges could be necessary should different conditions prevail or different judgments be made 
significant management judgment is also required for initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangibles assets resulting from business combinations pursuant asc management must assess the extent to which identified other intangibles assets are properly includable and with the appropriate fair value or properly excludable  by applying the recognition criteria 
this judgment affects not only the other intangible assets but the remainder calculation of goodwill 
the assessment of useful life for each acquired intangible impacts future financial position and operating performance through amortization expense 
inventory 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost  utilizing standard costs  applying the first in  first out method  or market 
we routinely assess our on hand inventory for timely identification and measurement of obsolete  slow moving or otherwise impaired inventory 
we write down inventory for estimated obsolescence  excess or unmarketable quantities equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than we projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
valuation of share based awards 
we account for share based compensation in accordance with asc  stock compensation 
we estimate the fair value of our employee stock awards at the date of grant using certain subjective assumptions  such as expected volatility which is based on a combination of historical and market based implied volatility  and the expected term of the awards  which is based on our historical experience of employee stock option exercises  including forfeitures 
the valuation assumptions we use in estimating the fair value of employee share based awards may change in future periods 
we recognize the fair value of awards over their vesting period or requisite service period 
in addition  we calculate our pool of excess tax benefits available within additional paid in capital in accordance with the provisions of asc accounting for income taxes 
we record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations 
in accordance with gaap  the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and for operating losses and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled 
in the event that these tax rates change  we will incur a benefit or detriment on our income tax expense in the period of change 
if we were to determine that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not 
table of contents realizable in the future  we will record a valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
in accordance with asc  income taxes  we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management s expectations could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results 
remediation of prior year material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as previously disclosed in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  and our quarterly reports on form q for the quarters ended september   june  and march   our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting  relating to our financial statement close process  was not effective as of december  our management concluded that  as of december   our internal control over financial reporting was not effective in providing reasonable assurance that a material misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis 
our evaluation concluded that we had a material weakness related to accounting for income taxes 
specifically  our processes  procedures and controls related to the preparation and review of the annual income tax provision were not effective to ensure that amounts recorded for the income tax provision and the related current and deferred income tax asset and liability accounts were accurate and determined in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
additionally  we did not maintain effective controls over the review and analysis of supporting work papers for such income tax balances 
during fiscal  we implemented the following remediation actions designed to address this material weakness hired a senior tax manager with knowledge and experience in relevant technical areas  re assessed the relationship with our third party tax consultant to ensure that there is an adequate level of review of the tax provision performed by the consultant and an appropriate level of oversight and validation by our management  ensured our internal review processes are carefully executed and the documentation management or version control is monitored to properly account for changes to the files used for calculation and review of the income tax provision and related balance sheet income tax accounts  and implemented a more extensive reconciliation process to support our computation of our income tax provision and related balance sheet income tax accounts  provided more supervision and performed a more thorough review of the work performed by the tax personnel 
we believe these actions have strengthened our internal control over financial reporting and addressed the material weakness identified above 
based on our testing of these enhanced procedures  management determined that  as of december   we have remediated the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as disclosed in the annual report on form k for december  
table of contents recently issued and adopted accounting standards in may  the financial accounting standards board  or the fasb  issued accounting standards update  or asu   fair value measurement  which amends the fair value guidance in asc  thereby completing the joint project to achieve substantially converged fair value measurement and disclosure requirements for us gaap and international financial reporting standards  or ifrs 
the new guidance changes some fair value measurement principles such as extending the level prohibition of blockage discounts to levels and in the fair value hierarchy and expands disclosure requirements  primarily for level measurements 
this update will be effective for us the first quarter of  applied prospectively with no early adoption permitted 
we do not anticipate the requirements of the update will have any significant impact on our financial position  operating results or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued asu  presentation of comprehensive income 
this asu prohibits equity statement presentation of other comprehensive income  requiring instead either a single continuous operating statement or two separate  but consecutive  statements of net income and other comprehensive income 
the new guidance does not change which components of comprehensive income are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income  or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income 
also  the earnings per share computation based on net income does not change 
in december  the fasb issued asu  deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 
 in order to redeliberate the portion of the earlier asu relating to presentation of reclassifications from other comprehensive income 
both updates are required for us the first quarter of  applied retrospectively 
we have opted for the permitted early adoption  applied retrospectively  of both updates in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  as asu and asu are only presentation standards  their adoption did not have any impact on our financial position  operating results or cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued asu  testing goodwill for impairment  giving entities the option to determine qualitatively whether they can bypass the two step goodwill impairment test in asc  intangibles  goodwill and other 
under the new guidance  if an entity chooses to perform a qualitative assessment and determines that it is more likely than not more than likelihood that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  it would then perform step of the annual goodwill impairment test and  if necessary  proceed to step otherwise  no further evaluation would be necessary 
each reporting period  the entity may choose which reporting units  if any  will use the qualitative assessment for goodwill impairment testing 
this update will be effective for us for any goodwill impairment tests  with early adoption permitted 
we do not anticipate the requirements of the update will have any significant impact on our financial position  operating results or cash flows  as we currently apply the existing step test for our single reporting unit business

table of contents installation experience and our flexibility in manpower allocations among customers to complete installations on a timely basis 
the timing of our product revenues is primarily dependent on when our customers schedules allow for installations 
the overall increase in product revenues was driven by a combination of increased installations of our new automation products  increases in lease renewals from existing customers and a full year of revenues derived from our acquisition of pandora at the end of the third quarter of we anticipate our revenues will continue to increase in at approximately to  as we fulfill our existing orders and as we experience a continued high volume of lease renewals that were initiated in cost of product revenues increased by million  or  in as compared to the increase was primarily a function of revenue growth  partially offset by the favorable impact of overall product mix and generally lower material costs from our cost reduction efforts during the year 
additionally  during the year we incurred higher product costs related to the manufacturing cost of the new g cabinet console platform  released on may  the early production units of the g cabinet console were at a higher product cost than our previous generation product 
this was due to initial production line ramp up and longer production cycles to validate the manufacturability and quality of the new console 
the majority of the higher production line cost was absorbed in the three months ended september  and december  the future cost of product revenues are expected to be more reflective of the previous generation product  net of any product mix effects

gross profit on service and other revenues increased by million  or  in as compared to this increase was due to increased revenues from an expanded installed base without proportional growth in service cost 
we expect our service and other revenues and the associated gross profit to continue to increase in at a similar rate with the continued expansion of our installed base of automation systems and service and maintenance contracts

research and development expenses increased by million  or  in as compared to research and development expenses represented and of total revenues in and  respectively 
the increase was due primarily to a million increase in compensation costs and million in other increases  partially offset by decreases of million in tools and million in outside services 
additional offset was provided by the capitalization of software development costs  increasing to million in as compared to million in due to the higher level of post feasibility beta testing that preceded several new product introductions in the second quarter of we expect research and development expenses to increase slightly in as we continue to invest in new products and services 
the amount of research and development expense can fluctuate based on the amount of prototype expenses for hardware and or the amount of capitalized software development costs in any given quarter 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  in as compared to selling  general and administrative expenses represented and of total revenues in and  respectively 
this increase was primarily due to a million increase in compensation costs related to increased sales and marketing staffing  a million increase for the settlement of litigation with medacist solutions group llc  as described in note legal proceedings of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k  and a million increase in freight  travel  promotional expenses and other costs 
reduced outside service and other spending of million partially offset these increases 
additionally  expenses were reduced by the million benefit from the settlement of a litigation claim with flo healthcare llc in the third quarter of for less than the amount previously accrued  as described in our annual report on form k for the year ended december   and million resulting from the favorable timing effect on expenses due to a reduction in accrued vacation 
we anticipate selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues to stabilize and reduce throughout as we have aligned our sales efforts and cost structure to the current economic and market environments and anticipate a reduction in legal expenses 

table of contents compared to research and development 
research and development expenses increased by million  or  in as compared to research and development expenses represented and of total revenues in and  respectively 
the increase in research and development expenses in was due to an increase of million in consulting expenses  an increase of million of labor and related costs  both of which are related to new hardware and software product development  and a decrease of million of software capitalization in compared to primarily due the release in of two major software releases used in our products
