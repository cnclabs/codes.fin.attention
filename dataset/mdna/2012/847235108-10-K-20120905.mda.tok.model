additionally  the us navy generally has the ability to terminate dss contracts  in whole or in part  without prior notice  for convenience or for default based on performance 
if any of these us navy contracts were to be terminated for convenience  sparton would generally be protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contracts and profit on those costs  but not the anticipated profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed 
we rely on the continued growth and financial stability of our customers  including our major customers 
adverse changes in the end markets they serve can reduce demand from our customers in those markets and or make customers in these end markets more price sensitive 
furthermore  mergers or restructurings among our customers or our customers customers could increase concentration or reduce total demand as the combined entities rationalize their business and consolidate their suppliers 
future developments  particularly in those end markets which account for more significant portions of our revenues  could harm our business and our results of operations 
sparton also generates large accounts receivable in connection with electronic contract manufacturing 
if one or more of our customers experiences financial difficulty and is unable to pay for the services provided  our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
if our customers seek bankruptcy protection  they could act to terminate all or a portion of their business with us  originate new business with our competitors and terminate or assign our long term supply agreements 
any loss of revenue from our major customers  including the non payment or late payment of our invoices  could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
congressional budgetary constraints or reallocations can reduce our government sales 
our us government contracts have many inherent risks that could adversely impact our financial results 
future governmental sales could be affected by a change in defense spending by the us government  or by changes in spending allocation that could result in one or more of our programs being reduced  delayed or terminated  which could adversely affect our financial results 
the company s us governmental sales are 
table of contents funded by the federal budget 
changes in negotiations for program funding levels or unforeseen world events can interrupt the funding for a program or contract 
the timing of sonobuoy sales to the us navy is dependent upon access to their test facilities and successful passage of their product tests 
any future reduction or interruption in access to the test range or changes in sonobuoy testing criteria may impact the consistency or predictability of our reported revenues 
customer cancellations  reductions  or delays could adversely affect our operating results 
we generally do not obtain long term purchase commitments from our customers 
customers may cancel orders  delay the delivery of orders or release orders for fewer products than we previously anticipated for a variety of reasons  including decreases in demand for their products and services 
such changes by a significant customer  by a group of customers  or by a single customer whose production is material to an individual facility could seriously harm results of operations in that period 
in addition  since much of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed  a reduction in customer demand would adversely affect our margins and operating income 
although we are always seeking new opportunities  we cannot be assured that we will be able to replace deferred  reduced or cancelled orders 
our inability to forecast the level of customer orders with much certainty makes it difficult to schedule production and maximize utilization of manufacturing capacity 
additionally  we are often required to place materials orders from vendors  some of which are non cancelable  based on an expected level of customer volume 
at june   non cancelable purchase orders with vendors totaled approximately million 
if actual demand is higher than anticipated  we may be required to increase staffing and other expenses in order to meet such demand of our customers 
alternatively  anticipated orders from our customers may be delayed or fail to materialize  thereby adversely affecting our results of operations 
such customer order fluctuations and deferrals have had a material adverse effect on us in the past  and we may experience similar effects in the future 
such order changes could cause a delay in the repayment to us for inventory expenditures we incurred in preparation for the customer s orders or  in certain circumstances  require us to return the inventory to our suppliers  resell the inventory to another customer or continue to hold the inventory 
in some cases  excess material resulting from longer order lead time is a risk due to the potential of order cancellation or design changes by customers 
additionally  dramatic changes in circumstances for a customer could also negatively impact the carrying value of our inventory for that customer 
the company and its customers may be unable to keep current with technological changes 
our customers participate in markets that have rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions  and relatively short product life cycles 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies or the emergence of new industry standards can render existing products obsolete or unmarketable 
our success depends upon our customers ability to enhance existing products and to develop and introduce new products  on a timely and cost effective basis  that keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards  and address increasingly sophisticated customer requirements 
there is no assurance that our customers will do so  and any failure to do so could substantially harm our customers and us 
additionally  our future success will depend upon our ability to maintain and enhance our own technological capabilities  develop and market manufacturing services and products which meet changing customer needs  and successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes in manufacturing processes on a cost effective and timely basis 
if we are unable to do so  business  financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
our growth strategies could be ineffective due to the risks of further acquisitions 
our growth strategy has included acquiring complementary businesses 
we could fail to identify  finance or complete suitable acquisitions on acceptable terms and prices 
acquisition efforts could increase a number of 
table of contents risks  including diversion of management s attention  difficulties in integrating systems and operations  potential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired companies and exposure to unanticipated liabilities  as well as the price we pay may exceed the value we realize 
our discovery of  or failure to discover  material issues during due diligence investigations of acquisition targets  either before closing with regard to potential risks of the acquired operations  or after closing with regard to the timely discovery of breaches of representations or warranties  could materially harm our business 
acquisitions also may result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets which are subject to potential impairments in the future that could harm our financial results 
our current use of advance billings within government contracts may not continue 
our current contracts with the us navy include provisions for certain billing and collection of funds from the government in advance of related inventory purchases and incurrence of manufacturing expenses 
these contractual provisions are an integral part of our capital and liquidity profile 
while we have other sources of liquidity including  but not limited to  our operations  existing cash balances and our revolving line of credit  and we believe we have sufficient liquidity for our anticipated needs over the next months  no assurances regarding liquidity can be made 
the discontinuance of advance billing provisions from future us navy contracts would require us to fund the working capital requirements related to these contracts from other sources and otherwise could materially adversely impact our business  results of operations and financial condition 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could increase operating costs 
a portion of the company s operations and some customers are in foreign locations 
as a result  transactions may occur in currencies other than the us dollar 
currency exchange rates fluctuate on a daily basis as a result of a number of factors and cannot be easily predicted 
volatility in the us dollar could seriously harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
the primary impact of currency exchange fluctuations is on the adjustments related to the remeasurement of the company s vietnamese financial statements into us dollars  which are included in current earnings  as well as impacting the cash  receivables  payables  property and equipment of our operating entities 
the company currently does not use financial instruments to hedge foreign currency fluctuation and unexpected expenses could occur from future fluctuations in exchange rates 
failure to attract and retain key personnel and skilled associates could hurt operations 
our success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of key management personnel 
while we have employment contracts in place with several of our executive officers  we nevertheless cannot be assured that we will retain our key employees  and the loss of service of any of these officers or key management personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business growth and operating results 
our future success will require an ability to attract and retain qualified employees 
competition for such key personnel is intense  and we cannot be assured that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
changes in the cost of providing pension and other employee benefits  including changes in health care costs  investment returns on plan assets  and discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities  could lead to increased costs in any of our operations 
certain of our us government contracts require our employees to maintain various levels of security clearances  and we are required to maintain certain facility security clearances complying with us government requirements 
if our employees are unable to obtain security clearances in a timely manner  or at all  or if our employees who hold security clearances are unable to maintain the clearances or terminate employment with us  then a customer requiring classified work could terminate the contract or decide not to renew it upon its expiration 
in addition  we expect that many of the contracts on which we will bid will require us to demonstrate our ability to obtain facility security clearances and employ personnel with specified types of security clearances 

table of contents to the extent we are not able to obtain facility security clearances or engage employees with the required security clearances for a particular contract  we may not be able to bid on or win new contracts  or effectively bid on expiring contracts 
we are involved in legal proceedings and unfavorable decisions could materially affect us 
our business activities expose us to risks of litigation with respect to our customers  suppliers  creditors  shareholders  product liability  or environmental related matters 
we may incur significant expense to defend or otherwise address current or future claims 
any litigation  even a claim without merit  could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources  and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
although we maintain insurance policies  we cannot assure you that this insurance will be adequate to protect us from all material judgments and expenses related to potential future claims or that these levels of insurance will be available in the future at economical prices or at all 
adverse regulatory developments could harm our business 
our business operates  and certain of our customers businesses operate  in heavily regulated environments 
we must manage the risk of changes in or adverse actions under applicable law or in our regulatory authorizations  licenses and permits  governmental security clearances  government procurement regulations or other legal rights in order to operate our business  manage our work force  or import and export goods and services as needed 
we also face the risk of other adverse regulatory actions  compliance costs  or governmental sanctions 
the regulations and regulatory bodies include  but are not limited to  the following the federal acquisition regulations  the truth in negotiations act  the false claims act and the false statements act  the foreign corrupt practices act  the food and drug administration  the federal aviation administration and the international traffic in arms regulations 
our failure to comply with applicable regulations  rules and approvals or misconduct by any of our employees could result in the imposition of fines and penalties  the loss of security clearances  the loss of our government contracts or our suspension or debarment from contracting with the us government generally  any of which would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
see also additional risk factors below relating to us government contract audits  securities laws regulations  environmental law regulations and foreign law regulations 
us government audits and investigations could adversely affect our business 
federal government agencies  including the defense contract audit agency dcaa and the defense contract management agency dcma  routinely audit and investigate government contracts and government contractors administrative processes and systems 
these agencies review the company s performance on contracts  pricing practices  cost structure and compliance with applicable laws  regulations and standards 
they also review the adequacy of the company s internal control systems and policies  including the company s purchasing  accounting  estimating  compensation and management information processes and systems 
any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed  while such costs already reimbursed must be refunded 
if an audit or investigation of our business were to uncover improper or illegal activities  then we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  including termination of contracts  forfeiture of profits  suspension of payments  fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the us government 
in addition  responding to governmental audits or investigations may involve significant expenses and divert management attention 
if any of the forgoing were to occur  our financial condition and operating result could be materially adversely affected 
the company responded in november to dcaa review comments received in the first quarter of fiscal regarding corrective actions to improve the reliability for accumulating costs under government contracts 
as a result  dcma has determined our cost accounting system is currently adequate and the company 
table of contents remains eligible to receive costs reimbursable contracts from the us government 
while the company s corrective actions remain open for further review  the company remains confident formal resolution of dcaa cost accounting practices findings will not have a material adverse impact on the company s financial results 
the efficiency of our operations could be adversely affected by disruptions to our information technology it services  including implementation of our new enterprise resource planning erp system 
we rely in part on various it systems to manage our operations and to provide analytical information to management 
these systems are vulnerable to  among other things  damage and interruption from power loss or natural disasters  computer system and network failures  loss of telecommunication services  physical and electronic loss of data  security breaches and computer viruses 
any inefficiencies or production down times resulting from such disruptions could have a negative impact on our ability to meet customers orders  resulting in a delay or decrease to our revenue and a reduction to our operating margins 
further  we are in the process of implementing a new erp system 
while we believe we are effectively managing the implementation  there are risks involved in the rollout of an enterprise wide project 
any disruption to our financial or other systems as a result of the erp rollout could have a material adverse impact on our business 
business disruptions could seriously harm our business and results of operations 
increased international political instability  evidenced by threats and occurrence of terrorist attacks  conflicts in the middle east and asia  and strained international relations arising from these conflicts  may hinder our ability to do business 
the political environment in communist countries can contribute to the threat of instability 
while we have not been adversely affected as yet due to this exposure  one of our facilities is based in vietnam  which is a communist country 
these events have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the us and world economies  particularly customer confidence and spending  which in turn could affect our revenue and results of operations 
the impact of these events on the volatility of the us and world financial markets could increase the volatility of our securities and may limit the capital resources available to us  our customers and our suppliers 
our operations could be subject to natural disasters  disease and other business disruptions  including earthquakes  power shortages  telecommunications failures  water shortages  tsunamis  floods  hurricanes  fires  pandemic outbreaks and other natural or manmade disasters  which could seriously harm our financial condition and increase our expenses 
in the past  hurricanes have adversely impacted the performance of two of our production facilities located in florida 
we have a production facility outside ho chi minh city  vietnam 
this area  in the tropics and close to the sea  may be vulnerable to storms  floods and typhoons 
changes in the securities laws and regulations have increased  and are likely to continue to increase our costs 
the sarbanes oxley act of the sarbanes oxley act and more recently the dodd frank act required or will require changes in some of our corporate governance  securities disclosure and compliance practices 
in response to the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act  the sec and the new york stock exchange nyse promulgated new rules on a variety of subjects 
similar rules are expected to be promulgated in relation to the dodd frank act 
compliance with these new rules has increased and may increase further our legal  financial and accounting costs 
absent significant changes in related rules  which we cannot assure  we anticipate some level of increased costs related to these new regulations to continue indefinitely 
we also expect these developments to make it more difficult and more expensive to obtain director and officer liability insurance  and we may be forced to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage 
likewise  these developments may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors or qualified management personnel 

table of contents if we are unable to maintain effective internal control over our financial reporting  investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements  which could result in a reduction in the value of our common stock 
as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act  the sec adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on the company s internal control over financial reporting in their annual reports on form k 
the report must contain an assessment by management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
in addition  the independent registered public accounting firm auditing a company s financial statements must attest to and report on the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting  if the company s public equity float remains above certain thresholds 
we are continuing our comprehensive efforts to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
if we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting  this could lead us to issue a financial restatement or otherwise cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations to the sec or could result in a finding by our independent auditors of a significant deficiency or material weakness in our controls over financial reporting  which  in turn  could result in an adverse reaction to our stock in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements 
we are subject to a variety of environmental laws  which expose us to potential liability 
our operations are regulated under a number of federal  state  provincial  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations  which govern  among other things  the discharge of hazardous materials into the air and water  as well as the handling  storage and disposal of such materials 
these laws and regulations include the clean air act  the clean water act  the resource  conservation and recovery act and the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  as well as analogous state and foreign laws 
compliance with these environmental laws is a significant consideration for us because we use various hazardous materials in our manufacturing processes 
we may be liable under environmental laws for the cost of cleaning up properties we own or operate if they are or become contaminated by the release of hazardous materials  regardless of whether we caused the release  even if we fully comply with applicable environmental laws 
in the event of contamination or violation of environmental laws  we could be held liable for damages including fines  penalties and the costs of remedial actions and could also be subject to revocation of our discharge permits 
any such penalties or revocations could require us to cease or limit production at one or more of our facilities  thereby harming our business 
in addition  such regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or could require us to acquire costly equipment  or to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations  including expenses associated with the recall of any non compliant product 
sparton has been involved with ongoing environmental remediation since the early s related to one of its former manufacturing facilities  located in albuquerque  new mexico 
at june   sparton had accrued approximately million as its estimate of the remaining minimum future undiscounted financial liability with respect to this matter 
uncertainties associated with environmental remediation contingencies are pervasive and often result in wide ranges of reasonably possible outcomes 
estimates developed in the early stages of remediation can vary significantly 
normally a finite estimate of cost does not become fixed and determinable at a specific point in time 
rather  the costs associated with environmental remediation become estimable over a continuum of events and activities that help to frame and define a liability 
factors which cause uncertainties for the company include  but are not limited to  the effectiveness of the current work plans in achieving targeted results and proposals of regulatory agencies for desired methods and outcomes 
it is possible that cash flows and results of operations could be materially affected by the impact of changes associated with the ultimate resolution of this contingency 
at june   the company estimates that it is reasonably possible  but not probable  that future environmental remediation costs associated with the company s past operations at the coors road property  in excess of amounts already recorded and net of doe reimbursement  could be up to million before income taxes over the next eighteen years 
see item legal proceedings of this annual report on form k 

table of contents operations outside of the united states may be affected by legal and regulatory risks  and government reviews  inquiries or investigations could harm the company s business 
the company s operations in vietnam and the business it conducts outside the united states are subject to risks relating to compliance with legal and regulatory requirements in the united states as well as in local jurisdictions 
additionally  there is a risk of potentially higher incidence of fraud or corruption in certain foreign jurisdictions and greater difficulty in maintaining effective internal controls 
from time to time  the company may conduct internal investigations and compliance reviews to ensure that the company is in compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
additionally  the company could be subject to inquiries or investigations by government and other regulatory bodies 
any determination that the company s operations or activities are not in compliance with united states laws  including the foreign corrupt practices act  or various international laws and regulations could expose the company to significant fines  penalties or other sanctions that may harm the business and reputation of the company 
if we are not able to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights  we may be adversely affected 
our success can be impacted by our ability to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights 
we rely primarily on patents  trademarks  copyrights  trade secrets and unfair competition laws  as well as license agreements and other contractual provisions  to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights 
however  a significant portion of our technology is not patented  and we may be unable or may not seek to obtain patent protection for this technology 
moreover  existing us legal standards relating to the validity  enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights offer only limited protection  may not provide us with any competitive advantages  and may be challenged by third parties 
the laws of countries other than the united states may be even less protective of intellectual property rights 
accordingly  despite our efforts  we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property or otherwise gaining access to our technology 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights  then our business  results of operations or financial condition could be negatively impacted 
certain shareholders have significant control and shares eligible for public sale could adversely affect the share price 
as of june   the directors  executive officers and shareholders beneficially owned or controlled an aggregate of approximately of our common stock 
accordingly  certain persons have significant influence over the election of our board of directors  the approval or disapproval of any other matters requiring shareholder approval  and the affairs and policies of the company 
such voting power could also have the effect of deterring or preventing a change in control of the company that might otherwise be beneficial to other shareholders 
conversely  such voting power could have the effect of deterring or preventing a change in control of the company that might otherwise be detrimental to other shareholders 
in addition  the company s stock is thinly traded 
thinly traded stocks can be susceptible to sudden  rapid declines in price  especially when holders of large blocks of shares seek exit positions 
sales of substantial amounts of common stock by shareholders  or even the potential for such sales  may cause the market price to decline and could impair the ability to raise capital through the sale of equity securities 
in the future  we may need additional funding  which could be raised through issuances of equity securities 
we also have the right to issue shares upon such terms and conditions and at such prices as our board of directors may establish 
such offerings would dilute the ownership interest of existing shareholders and could cause a dilution of the net tangible book value of such shares 
at june   there were options outstanding for the purchase of  shares of common stock of the company  all of which options were vested and exercisable 
holders of our common stock could suffer dilution if outstanding common stock options are exercised in excess of the number of shares repurchased by sparton 

table of contents market volatility may have an adverse impact on our pension costs associated with our defined benefit plan 
volatility and uncertainty in the global financial market has resulted in the company making significant cash contributions to our pension plan in recent years 
for a further discussion of the sparton corporation pension plan  see pension obligations in the critical accounting policies and estimates section in part ii  item of this report and note  employee retirement benefits plans  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
notwithstanding the actions taken to reduce the costs of the plan in recent years  if the global financial market continues to be unstable or declines further  we may be required to make further contributions to the pension plan in future periods 
these contributions  if made  would negatively impact our liquidity  cash flows  and financial position 
the tightened credit market  both nationally and globally  may adversely affect the availability of funds to us for working capital  liquidity requirements  and other purposes  which may adversely affect our cash flows and financial condition 
we anticipate that our recently amended revolving line of credit facility will be a component of our available working capital during fiscal the line of credit facility has been extended to august  for a summary of our banking arrangements  see note  debt  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
there are no assurances that the line of credit will be sufficient for all purposes 
additionally  if vendors of electronic components restrict or reduce credit to us for purchase of raw materials as a result of general market conditions  the vendor s credit status  or our financial position  it could adversely affect liquidity  cash flows  and results of operations 
our stock price may be volatile  and the stock is thinly traded  which may cause investors to lose most or part of their investment in our common stock 
the stock market may experience volatility that is often unrelated to the operating performance of any particular company or companies 
if market sector or industry based fluctuations occur  our stock price could decline regardless of our actual operating performance  and investors could lose a substantial part of their investments 
moreover  if an active public market for our common stock is not sustained in the future  it may be difficult to resell such stock 
generally  our stock is thinly traded 
when trading volumes are low  a relatively small buy or sell order can result in a relatively large change in the trading price of our common stock and investors may not be able to sell their securities at a favorable price

although the company entered into a long term lease of the coors road property that was accounted for as a sale of property during fiscal  it remains responsible for the remediation obligations related to its past operation of this facility 
at june   sparton had accrued approximately million as its estimate of the remaining minimum future undiscounted financial liability with respect to this matter  of which approximately million is classified as a current liability and included on the balance sheet in other accrued expenses 
the company s minimum cost estimate is based upon existing technology and excludes certain legal costs  which are expensed as incurred 
the company s estimate includes equipment and operating and maintenance costs for onsite and offsite pump and treat containment systems  as well as continued onsite and offsite monitoring 
it also includes periodic reporting requirements 
on october   approximately million of cash was utilized to establish a trust  the sparton corporation financial assurance trust  for remediation activity 
the funds were held in sparton s name and were invested with sparton receiving the benefit of the investment return

the trust was established to meet the united 
table of contents states environmental protection agency s epa financial assurance requirements for the fiscal year ended june   with trust funds to be drawn upon only should sparton not continue to meet its financial remediation requirements 
the trust was to remain in place until the company could again satisfy the epa financial assurance requirements through compliance with financial ratios  as was previously attained on an annual basis until fiscal year based on the company s financial results for fiscal year  the company was again in compliance with the financial ratios and dissolved the trust during october in fiscal  sparton reached an agreement with the united states department of energy doe and others to recover certain remediation costs 
under the settlement terms  sparton received cash and obtained some degree of risk protection as the doe agreed to reimburse sparton for of certain future environmental expenses in excess of million incurred from the date of settlement  if any  of which approximately million has been expended as of june  toward the million threshold

business overview general sparton is a provider of complex and sophisticated electromechanical devices with capabilities that include concept development  industrial design  design and manufacturing engineering  production  distribution  and field service 
the company serves the medical  military aerospace and industrial instrumentation markets through three reportable business segments  medical device medical  complex systems cs and defense security systems dss 
all of the company s facilities are registered to iso standards  including or  with most having additional certifications 
the company s products and services include products for original equipment manufacturers oem and emerging technology et customers that are microprocessor based systems that include transducers  printed circuit boards and assemblies  sensors  and electromechanical components  as well as development and design engineering services relating to these product sales 
sparton also develops and manufactures sonobuoys  anti submarine warfare asw devices used by the united states navy and other free world countries 
many of the physical and technical attributes in the production of sonobuoys are similar to those required in the production of the company s other electrical and electromechanical products and assemblies 
the company uses an internal management reporting system  which provides important financial data to evaluate performance and allocate the company s resources on a market segment basis 
net sales for segments are attributed to the segment in which the product is manufactured or service is performed 
a segment s performance is evaluated based upon its operating income loss 
a segment s operating income loss includes its gross profit on sales less its selling and administrative expenses  but excludes some corporate and other unallocated items such as  interest expense  interest income  other income expense and income tax expense benefit 
allocations of certain corporate operating expenses are allocated based on the nature of the service provided 
corporate and other unallocated costs primarily represent corporate administrative expenses related to those administrative  financial and human resource activities which are not allocated to operations and excluded from segment profit 
these costs are not allocated to the segments  as management excludes such costs when assessing the performance of the segments 
inter segment transactions are generally accounted for at amounts that approximate arm s length transactions 
the accounting policies for each of the segments are the same as for the company taken as a whole 
medical segment medical operations are comprised of contract development  design  production and fulfillment of sophisticated medical and biotech devices and sub assemblies for industry leaders  emerging technologies companies and start ups 
in manufacturing devices for its customers  this business unit follows specific design and manufacturing processes to assure product reliability and safety in accordance with food and drug administration fda guidelines and approvals 
this group specializes in technologies  systems and processes required by medical oem and et customers primarily in the diagnostic  therapeutic and surgical segments of the medical device and biotech market spaces 

table of contents complex systems segment complex systems operations provides complex electronics systems to multiple industries  offering end to end development and manufacturing solutions focused on high expectations of quality and delivery performance through an international footprint 
as a vertically integrated business unit  this segment assists in providing its customers with seamless development of circuit card and sub assemblies for integration into electro mechanical solutions 
by focusing on maximizing efficiency and cost containment at the various steps in the design  engineering  and manufacturing process  complex systems acts as an intelligent source and ideal partner for development firms and oems 
this business unit is a supplier for low to medium volume high complexity commercial and military aerospace applications  telecommunications  energy  and industrial controls

dss segment dss operations are comprised of design  development and production of products for a number of technologically significant programs aimed at fulfilling defense and commercial needs 
specializing in the development and production of complex electromechanical equipment  sparton designs and manufactures sonobuoys  asw devices for the us navy and foreign governments that meet department of state licensing requirements 
this business unit also performs an engineering development function for the united states military and prime defense contractors for advanced technologies ultimately leading to future defense products as well as replacements for existing products 
the sonobuoy product line is built to the customer s demanding specifications 
these products are restricted by international tariff and arms regulations itar and qualified by the us navy  which limits opportunities for competition 
additionally  this business unit internally develops and markets commercial products based on its navigation and underwater acoustic knowledge and the intrinsic skill sets of its technical staff 
risks and uncertainties sparton  as a high mix  low to medium volume supplier  provides rapid product turnaround for customers 
high mix describes customers needing multiple product types with generally low to medium volume manufacturing runs 
as a contract manufacturer with customers in a variety of markets  the company has substantially less visibility of end user demand and  therefore  forecasting sales can be problematic 
customers may cancel their orders  change production quantities and or reschedule production for a number of reasons 
depressed economic conditions may result in customers delaying delivery of product  or the placement of purchase orders for lower volumes than previously anticipated 
unplanned cancellations  reductions  or delays by customers may negatively impact the company s results of operations 
as many of the company s costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed within given ranges of production  a reduction in customer demand can disproportionately affect the company s gross margins and operating income 
the majority of the company s sales have historically come from a limited number of customers 
significant reductions in sales to  or a loss of  one of these customers could materially impact our operating results if the company were not able to replace those sales with new business 
other risks and uncertainties that may affect our operations  performance  growth forecasts and business results include  but are not limited to  timing and fluctuations in us and or world economies  sharp volatility of world financial markets over a short period of time  competition in the overall contract manufacturing business  availability of production labor and management services under terms acceptable to the company  congressional budget outlays for sonobuoy development and production  congressional legislation  uncertainties associated with the outcome of litigation  changes in the interpretation of environmental laws and the uncertainties of environmental remediation and customer labor and work strikes 
further risk factors are the availability and cost of materials  as well as non cancelable purchase orders we have committed to in relation to customer forecasts 
table of contents that can be subject to change 
a number of events can impact these risks and uncertainties  including potential escalating utility and other related costs due to natural disasters  as well as political uncertainties such as the unrest in africa and the middle east 
the february earthquake  tsunami and resultant nuclear disaster in japan had the potential to cause availability and pricing issues relating to certain materials used within the company s products 
the company currently does not believe that the effects of these events will have a material impact on its business 
additional trends  risks and uncertainties include dependence on key personnel  risks surrounding the company s recent acquisitions  uncertainties surrounding the global economy and us healthcare legislation and the effects of those uncertainties on oem behavior  including heightened inventory management  product development cycles and outsourcing strategies 
finally  the sarbanes oxley act  and more recently the dodd frank act have required or will require changes in  and formalization of  some of the company s corporate governance and compliance practices 
the sec and the new york stock exchange have also passed or will pass related rules and regulations requiring additional compliance activities 
compliance with these rules has increased administrative costs and may increase these costs further in the future 
a further discussion of the company s risk factors has been included in part i  item a  risk factors  of this annual report on form k 
management cautions readers not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements  which are subject to influence by the enumerated risk factors as well as unanticipated future events

inflation we believe that inflation has not had a significant impact in the past and is not likely to have a significant impact in the foreseeable future on our results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported as assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
estimates are regularly evaluated and are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require management s judgment in application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  which is included in item  the following involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of sparton s board of directors 
environmental contingencies one of sparton s former manufacturing facilities  located in albuquerque  new mexico coors road  has been the subject of ongoing investigations and remediation efforts conducted with the epa under the resource conservation and recovery act rcra 
as discussed in note  commitments and contingencies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k  sparton has accrued its estimate of the minimum future non discounted financial liability 
the estimate was developed using existing technology and excludes legal and related consulting costs 
the minimum cost estimate includes equipment  operating and monitoring costs for both onsite and offsite remediation 
sparton recognizes certain legal costs in the periods incurred and reviews its epa accrual activity quarterly 
uncertainties associated with environmental 
table of contents remediation contingencies are pervasive and often result in wide ranges of reasonably possible outcomes 
estimates developed in the early stages of remediation can vary significantly 
normally a finite estimate of cost does not become fixed and determinable at a specific point in time 
rather  the costs associated with environmental remediation become estimable over a continuum of events and activities that help to frame and define a liability 
factors which cause uncertainties for the company include  but are not limited to  the effectiveness of the current work plans in achieving targeted results and proposals of regulatory agencies for desired methods and outcomes 
it is possible that cash flows and results of operations could be materially affected by the impact of changes associated with the ultimate resolution of this contingency 
at june   the company estimates that it is reasonably possible  but not probable  that future environmental remediation costs associated with the company s past operations at the coors road property  in excess of amounts already recorded and net of doe reimbursement  could be up to million before income taxes over the next eighteen years 
government contract cost estimates government production contracts are accounted for based on completed units accepted with respect to revenue recognition and their estimated average cost per unit regarding costs 
losses for the entire amount of the contract are recognized in the period when such losses are determinable 
significant judgment is exercised in determining estimated total contract costs including  but not limited to  cost experience to date  estimated length of time to contract completion  costs for materials  production labor and support services to be expended and known issues on remaining units to be completed 
in addition  estimated total contract costs can be significantly affected by changing test routines and procedures  resulting design modifications and production rework from these changing test routines and procedures  and limited range access for testing these design modifications and rework solutions 
estimated costs developed in the early stages of contracts can change  sometimes significantly  as the contracts progress  and events and activities take place 
changes in estimates can also occur when new designs are initially placed into production 
the company formally reviews its costs incurred to date and estimated costs to complete on all significant contracts at least quarterly and revised estimated total contract costs are reflected in the financial statements 
advance billings in excess of inventoried costs are included in current liabilities 
depending upon the circumstances  it is possible that the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected by changes in estimated costs to complete on one or more significant government contracts 
commercial inventory valuation valuation of commercial customer inventories requires a significant degree of judgment 
these valuations are influenced by the company s experience to date with both customers and other markets  prevailing market conditions for raw materials  contractual terms and customers ability to satisfy these obligations  environmental or technological materials obsolescence  changes in demand for customer products  and other factors resulting in acquiring materials in excess of customer product demand 
contracts with some commercial customers may be based upon estimated quantities of product manufactured for shipment over estimated time periods 
raw material inventories are purchased to fulfill these customer requirements 
within these arrangements  customer demand for products frequently changes  sometimes creating excess and obsolete inventories 
the company regularly reviews raw material inventories by customer for both excess and obsolete quantities 
wherever possible  the company attempts to recover its full cost of excess and obsolete inventories from customers or  in some cases  through other markets 
when it is determined that the company s carrying cost of such excess and obsolete inventories cannot be recovered in full  a charge is taken against income for the difference between the carrying cost and the estimated realizable amount 
these cost adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory create a new cost basis for the inventory 
the company recorded inventory write downs totaling approximately million  million and million for the years ended june   and  respectively 
these charges are included in cost of goods sold for the periods presented 
if inventory that has previously been impaired is subsequently sold  the amount of reduced cost basis is reflected as cost of goods 
table of contents sold 
the company experienced minimal subsequent sales of excess and obsolete inventory during the three years ended june  that resulted in higher gross margins due to previous write downs 
such sales and the impact of those sales on gross margin were not material to the years presented 
if assumptions the company has used to value its inventory deteriorate in the future  additional write downs may be required 
allowance for probable losses on receivables the accounts receivable balance is recorded net of allowances for amounts not expected to be collected from customers 
the allowance is estimated based on historical experience of write offs  the level of past due amounts  information known about specific customers with respect to their ability to make payments  and future expectations of conditions that might impact the collectability of accounts 
accounts receivable are generally due under normal trade terms for the industry 
credit is granted  and credit evaluations are periodically performed  based on a customer s financial condition and other factors 
although the company does not generally require collateral  cash in advance or letters of credit may be required from customers in certain circumstances  including some foreign customers 
when management determines that it is probable that an account will not be collected  it is charged against the allowance for probable losses 
the company reviews the adequacy of its allowance monthly 
the allowance for doubtful accounts considered necessary was approximately million and million at june  and  respectively 
if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payment  additional allowances may be required 
given the company s significant balance of government receivables and in some cases letters of credit from foreign customers  collection risk is considered minimal 
historically  uncollectible accounts have generally been insignificant  have generally not exceeded management s expectations  and the allowance is deemed adequate 
pension obligations the company calculates the cost of providing pension benefits under the provisions of fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  compensation retirement benefits  asc topic 
the key assumptions required within the provisions of asc topic are used in making these calculations 
the most significant of these assumptions are the discount rate used to value the future obligations and the expected return on pension plan assets 
the discount rate is consistent with market interest rates on high quality  fixed income investments 
the expected return on assets is based on long term returns and assets held by the plan  which is influenced by historical averages 
if actual interest rates and returns on plan assets materially differ from the assumptions  future adjustments to the financial statements would be required 
while changes in these assumptions can have a significant effect on the pension benefit obligation and the unrecognized gain or loss accounts disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the effect of changes in these assumptions is not expected to have the same relative effect on net periodic pension expense in the near term 
while these assumptions may change in the future based on changes in long term interest rates and market conditions  there are no known expected changes in these assumptions as of june  as indicated above  to the extent the assumptions differ from actual results  there would be a future impact on the financial statements 
the extent to which this will result in future expense is not determinable at this time as it will depend upon a number of variables  including trends in interest rates and the actual return on plan assets 
the annual actuarial valuation of the pension plan is completed at the end of each fiscal year 
based on these valuations  net periodic pension benefit for fiscal was calculated to be million compared to net periodic pension expense prior to settlement expenses of million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
effective april   participation and the accrual of benefits in the company s pension plan were frozen  at which time all participants became fully vested and all remaining prior service costs were recognized 
lump sum benefit distributions during fiscal years and exceeded plan service and interest costs  resulting in lump sum settlement charges of approximately million and million also being recognized during the respective years 
these settlement charges resulted from several business and economic factors that have affected the measurement of the plan s projected benefit obligation in recent years  including the recent 
table of contents management actions described above  changes in the plan s benefit formula  the timing of participants retirement  changes in assumed interest rates  variation in investment returns  and the amounts of lump sum distributions paid 
the components of net periodic pension expense are detailed in note  employee retirement benefit plans  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
business combinations the company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with asc topic  business combinations 
accordingly  the company recognizes amounts for identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed equal to their estimated acquisition date fair values 
transaction and integration costs associated with business combinations are expensed as incurred 
any excess of the acquisition price over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill while any excess of the estimated fair value of net assets acquired over the acquisition price is recorded in current earnings as a gain 
the company makes various assumptions in estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
as fair value is a market based measurement  it is determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use 
the most significant assumptions typically relate to the estimated fair values of inventory and intangible assets  including customer lists and non compete agreements 
management arrives at estimates of fair value based upon assumptions it believes to be reasonable 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired business and is inherently uncertain 
critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected discounted cash flows from customer relationships and contracts assuming similar product platforms and completed projects  the acquired company s market position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired customer relationships will continue to generate revenue streams  and attrition and discount rates 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results  particularly with respect to amortization periods assigned to identifiable intangible assets 
valuation of property  plant and equipment the company records an impairment charge on our investment in property  plant and equipment that we hold and use in our operations if and when management determines that the related carrying values may not be recoverable 
if one or more impairment indicators are deemed to exist  sparton will measure any impairment of these assets based on current independent appraisals or a projected discounted cash flow analysis using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our business model 
our estimates of cash flows require significant judgment based on our historical and anticipated operating results and are subject to many factors 
during the year ended june   the company recognized impairment charges of approximately million related to the restructuring related activities  primarily related to the closures of the company s jackson  michigan  london  ontario  canada and albuquerque  new mexico facilities 
goodwill and intangible assets the company tests for possible goodwill impairment annually or more often should events or changes in circumstances indicate the carry value of the goodwill may not be recoverable 
the test is conducted at the reporting unit level 
sparton has three reportable business segments medical  complex systems  and dss 
in fiscal  medical  complex systems and dss each consist of a single reporting unit 
all of the company s goodwill resides within the medical reporting unit and  for fiscal and fiscal  goodwill impairment testing was conducted on this single reporting unit 
in fiscal  medical consisted of two reporting units i the company s ohio business purchased from astro during fiscal and holding the goodwill related to the astro purchase  and ii the company s colorado businesses acquired from delphi and byers peak during fiscal and holding the goodwill related to the byers peak acquisition 
for fiscal  goodwill impairment 
table of contents testing was conducted on these two medical segment reporting units 
the ohio and newly acquired combined colorado businesses were considered separate operating segments and therefore separate reporting units during fiscal due to the nature of how these businesses were managed and internally reported on during that year 
during fiscal  these two businesses were aggregated as one operating segment and therefore one reporting unit due to the similar nature of their businesses and combined manner in which they were managed and internally reported on during the year 
the impairment analysis is a two step process 
the first step is to identify a potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit  goodwill is considered not impaired and the company is not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then management will perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then the company would record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
sparton determines the fair value of its medical reporting unit  with the assistance of an independent valuation firm  based upon a combination of the income approach discounted cash flow method and market approach market comparable model methodologies 
in concluding on the fair value estimates of its reporting units  the income approach and the market approach are given weighting based on the quality and suitability of information available in performing each approach 
the income approach methodology utilized in estimating the fair value of the company s reporting units for purposes of the goodwill impairment testing requires various judgmental assumptions about revenues  operating margins  growth rates  working capital requirements and appropriate discount rate 
in determining those judgmental assumptions  sparton considers a variety of data  including  for each reporting unit  its annual budget for the upcoming year  its longer term business plan  anticipated future cash flows  market data  and historical cash flow growth rates 
the key assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the company s reporting units under the discounted cash flow method are i projected revenue growth over a five year period  ii projected operating margins over a five year period  iii projected terminal growth rate  and iv a weighted average cost of capital 
under the market approach  the value of each of the company s reporting units is estimated by comparing it to publicly traded firms in similar lines of business and geographic markets 
the market approach takes into account  among other things  the market value of total invested capital to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda multiples of comparable companies 
the selected multiples are then applied to the reporting unit s projected ebitda to arrive at an indicated range of value 
the company s fiscal and annual tests of goodwill related to its single medical reporting unit did not indicate that the related goodwill was impaired 
the company determined at those times that the fair value of the reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying value  having exceeded the carrying values by approximately and  respectively 
the company s fiscal annual test of goodwill related to its colorado reporting unit similarly did not indicate that the related goodwill was impaired 
the company determined that the fair value of the reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying value  having exceeded its carrying value by approximately 
the company s fiscal annual test of goodwill related to its ohio reporting unit did indicate that the related goodwill was impaired 
the company determined that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeded its fair value  requiring sparton to compare the carrying value of this goodwill to its implied fair value  which resulted in a non cash impairment charge of approximately million recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal to reflect this asset at its fair value of million 

table of contents the drop in fair value between fiscal and fiscal reflected various downward trends in volume within the company s ohio reporting unit  which was acquired in fiscal  including the impact of a customer disengagement and siemens fiscal fourth quarter notification of its intent to dual source certain programs with us as part of an overall dual sourcing strategy for certain of its critical programs 
the company s assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the medical segment s ohio reporting unit in fiscal reflected the company s outlook at that time for the reporting unit and reflected the effects of the events and uncertainties mentioned above  including but not limited to  lower expected revenues and lower expected operating margins than reflected in the company s fiscal goodwill impairment analysis 
determining the fair value of any reporting unit and intangible asset is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
the company bases its fair value estimates on assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
circumstances that may lead to future impairment of goodwill include  but are not limited to  unforeseen decreases in future performance or industry demand  as well as further loss of a significant customer or program in excess of future incremental new business wins 
the next annual goodwill impairment review is expected to be performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company s intangible assets other than goodwill represent the values assigned to customer relationships acquired in conjunction with the company s purchases of astro and byers peak and values assigned to non compete agreements acquired in conjunction with the company s purchase of byers peak 
all of the company s intangible assets are included within the medical segment 
the impairment test for these intangible assets is conducted when impairment indicators are present 
the company continually evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that would indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of its intangible assets warrant revision or that the remaining balance of such assets may not be recoverable 
the company uses an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the asset in measuring whether the asset is recoverable 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows  an impairment charge would be recognized for the amount that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
as noted above  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company was notified by siemens that it intended to dual source two of its larger programs with the company beginning in fiscal siemens was acquired as a customer in conjunction with the company s purchase of astro and as such sparton considered siemens dual sourcing of these two programs to be an impairment indicator requiring impairment review of the related intangible asset 
this impairment review  which was conducted during the fourth quarter of fiscal  concluded that the carrying value of this intangible asset was not fully recoverable and consequently a non cash impairment charge of approximately million was recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal to record this asset at its fair value of million 
the other business events and uncertainties described above in relation to the medical segment s ohio reporting unit were also contributing factors to the astro customer relationship impairment charge 
as part of the impairment review  the estimated remaining useful life of this asset was evaluated with the company determining that no change was warranted 
during fiscal and in previous years  the customer relationships acquired in conjunction with the company s purchase of astro were amortizing on a straight line basis over years 
the straight line method was used to amortize these identified intangible assets because the company believed that the expected undiscounted cash flows were reasonably consistent with a ratable decline in value over time 
beginning in fiscal  the remaining customer relationships acquired in conjunction with the company s purchase of astro are being amortized using an accelerated methodology on its remaining life as the company now believes that this more reasonably reflects the expected future undiscounted cash flows of the asset 
the customer relationships acquired in conjunction with the company s purchase of byers peak are also being amortized using an accelerated methodology over ten years 
the company s non compete agreements are being amortized on a straight line basis over two years as the ratable decline in value over time is most consistent with the contractual nature of these assets 

table of contents income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves management estimating the actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
future taxable income depends on the ability to generate income in excess of allowable deductions 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change this allowance in a period  an expense benefit is recorded within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
in and  the company recorded valuation allowances against substantially all of its net deferred tax assets as management believed that the realization of the deferred tax assets related to the net operating loss carryovers and the other net temporary timing differences while possible  was not more likely than not 
in  the company restored a large portion of the deferred tax assets as the company then believed that the realization of the remaining net operating loss carryovers and the other net temporary timing differences was more likely than not  based on achieved levels of profitability over the past two fiscal years combined with the expectation of future profitability 
in making these decisions to both record a valuation allowance and restore the net deferred tax assets  the company considered all available positive and negative evidence  including future reversals of taxable temporary differences  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies  and recent financial results 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to change the valuation allowance that could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  significant judgment and estimates would be required in determining how to account for uncertain tax positions the company might take in the next twelve months 
the company believes its income tax filing positions and deductions will be sustained on audit and does not anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flow 
pursuant to fasb asc topic  no liability has been recorded for uncertain tax positions 
stock based compensation asc topic  share based payment  requires significant judgment and the use of estimates in the assumptions for the model used to value the share based payment awards  including stock price volatility  and expected option terms 
in addition  expected forfeiture rates for the share based awards must be estimated 
because of our small number of option grants during our history  we are limited in our historical experience to use as a basis for these assumptions 
while we believe that the assumptions and judgments used in our estimates are reasonable  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions
