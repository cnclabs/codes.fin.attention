item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the following discussion  general communication  inc gci and its direct and indirect subsidiaries are referred to as we  us and our 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to the allowance for doubtful receivables  unbilled revenues  accrual of the usf high cost remote area program support  share based compensation  inventory at lower of cost or market  reserve for future customer credits  valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets  depreciable and amortizable lives of assets  the carrying value of long lived assets including goodwill  cable certificates and wireless licenses  our effective tax rate  purchase price allocations  the accrual of cost of goods sold exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense cost of goods sold  depreciation  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
see also our cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements 
the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and supplementary data as presented in part iv of this form k 
general overview through our focus on long term results  acquisitions  and strategic capital investments  we strive to consistently grow our revenues and expand our margins 
we have historically met our cash needs for operations  regular capital expenditures and maintenance capital expenditures through our cash flows from operating activities 
historically  cash requirements for significant acquisitions and major capital expenditures have been provided largely through our financing activities 
the national economy continues to see persistent unemployment and slow economic growth and even once stabilized is not expected to return quickly to a period of strong growth 
should the national economy deteriorate further  it could lead to reductions in consumer spending which could impact our revenue growth 
we believe the alaska economy continues to perform well compared to most other states at the current time 
the state of alaska has large cash reserves that should enable it to maintain its budget for at least the short term 
this cash reserve is important for alaska s economy as the state is the largest employer and second largest source of gross state product 
the majority of our revenue is driven by the strength of the alaska economy which appears to have weathered the recessionary pressures relatively well to date 
nonetheless we cannot predict the impact the nation s future economic situation may have on us in the future 
as part of an agreement signed in december with at t mobility  at t mobility has provided to us a large block of wireless network usage at no charge that we use for roaming 
this block of minutes expired in january and we expect our wireless cost of goods sold to increase million to million before factoring in the impact of subscriber growth 
our future wireless cost of goods sold will depend on several factors including the impact and timing of our wireless network build out  the pattern of usage by our wireless subscribers  and negotiated rates with our roaming partners 
as an etc  we receive support from the usf to support the provision of wireline local access and wireless service in high cost areas 
on november   the fcc published a final rule to reform the methodology for distributing usf high cost support for voice and broadband services  as well as to the access charge regime for terminating traffic between carriers high cost order 
the high cost order divided support to alaska between urban and remote areas 
support for cetcs serving urban areas that generally include anchorage  fairbanks  and juneau will follow national reforms  capping support per provider per service area as of january   and commencing a five step phase down on july  in addition to broader reforms  the fcc tailored revisions specifically for cetcs serving remote alaska  intended to address the unique challenges for serving these areas 
support to these locations will be capped and distributed on a per line basis until the later of july   or the implementation of a successor funding mechanism 
a further rulemaking to consider successor funding mechanisms is underway 
we cannot predict at this time the outcome of this proceeding or its effect on remote high cost support available to us  but our revenue for providing local services in these areas would be materially adversely affected by a substantial reduction of usf support 
the high cost order remote and urban program changes decreased our revenue million for the year ended december   primarily impacting our consumer segment 
the high cost order remote and urban program changes will decrease our revenue approximately million as compared to at december   we have million and million in remote and urban high cost accounts receivable  respectively 
in november  verizon acquired a license for mhz wireless spectrum covering alaska 
we expect verizon will build an lte network in and subsequently they will be an additional competitor where our markets overlap 
we cannot predict the potential impact this new competition may have on us in the future

consumer segment revenues the increase in data revenue is primarily due to a increase in cable modem revenue to million due to increased subscribers  rate increases in may and august and in may and our subscribers selection of plans that offer higher speeds 
as discussed in the general overview section of this item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the fcc published the high cost order in november the high cost order remote and urban program changes decreased our consumer segment voice revenue  for the year ended december   and decreased our consumer segment wireless revenue million for the year ended december  the high cost order remote and urban program changes will result in decreased consumer segment voice revenue of approximately million and decreased consumer segment wireless revenue of approximately million for the year ending december  on february   the fcc released its report and order and further notice of proposed rulemaking to comprehensively reform and modernize the usf s lifeline program 
the lifeline program is administered by the usac and is designed to ensure that quality telecommunications services are available to low income customers at just  reasonable  and affordable rates 
we participate in the lifeline program and recognized million in consumer wireless lifeline program support revenue during the year ended december  following are the reforms included in the order that we expect to impact consumer segment wireless revenue the order adopted on an interim basis a flat rate of to replace the support previously available under tier i through tier iii support mechanisms 
the replacement support reduces the wireless subscriber per line support which we expect will result in a  reduction in our revenue for the year ending december  the fcc intends to further investigate whether this support amount is reasonable over the long term in further rulemaking 
the order adopted a requirement for annual recertification of all lifeline subscribers enrolled as of june  to be completed by the end of we are evaluating this requirement and possible processes and cannot predict whether this new rule will have a material impact on our income statement  financial position or cash flows 
consumer segment cost of goods sold the increase in video cost of goods sold is primarily due to increased channels offered to our subscribers  increased rates paid to programmers and increased costs associated with delivery of digital services offered through our hd dvr converter boxes 
this increase was partially offset by decreased costs due to a decrease in subscribers 
the wireless cost of goods sold increase is primarily due to increased costs for wireless handset equipment sales and a change in the allocation of network maintenance costs 
the increased wireless handset equipment sale costs are associated with an increased number of premium wireless handsets which have higher costs and an increased number of handsets issued to new customers and those extending their service 
the change in allocation of network maintenance costs resulted in an increase to our consumer segment and a decrease to our network access  commercial and managed broadband segments 
consumer segment adjusted ebitda the decrease in adjusted ebitda is primarily due to increased cost of goods sold as described above in consumer segment cost of goods sold and an increase in the selling  general and administrative expense that was allocated to our consumer segment due to an increase in the segment margin upon which the selling  general and administrative expense allocation is based and an increase in consolidated selling  general and administrative expense 
these increases are partially offset by increased revenue as described above in consumer segment revenues

beginning in the these cost of goods sold were reclassified to data cost of goods sold for a more accurate presentation  and million in cost of goods sold related to special project work 
network access segment adjusted ebitda the adjusted ebitda decrease is primarily due to decreased revenue and increased cost of goods sold as described above in network access segment cost of goods sold 
these changes are partially offset by a decrease in the selling  general and administrative expense that was allocated to our network access segment primarily due to a decrease in the segment margin upon which the selling  general and administrative expense allocation is based 
commercial segment overview commercial segment revenue represented of consolidated revenues

if one entity purchases multiple cable modem service access points  each access point is counted as a subscriber 
a wireless line in service is defined as a revenue generating wireless device 
commercial segment revenues the increase in data revenue is primarily due to a million or increase in managed services project revenue due to special project work 
commercial segment cost of goods sold the decrease in voice cost of goods sold is primarily due to the intrastate access reform act intrastate access reform which went into effect july intrastate access reform eliminated the ilecs ability to bill long distance carriers for certain intrastate line charges 
this decrease was partially offset by the absence of a million favorable adjustment for refunds from several vendors in in the course of business we estimate unbilled long distance services cost of goods sold based upon minutes of use processed through our network and established rates 
such estimates are revised when subsequent billings are received  payments are made  billing matters are researched and resolved  tariffed billing periods lapse  or when disputed charges are resolved 
the increase in data cost of goods sold is primarily due to a million or increase in managed services project cost of goods sold related to the increased revenue described above in commercial segment revenues 
commercial segment adjusted ebitda the adjusted ebitda increase is primarily due to increased revenue as described above in commercial segment revenues 
this increase was partially offset by increased cost of goods sold as described above in commercial segment cost of goods sold and an increase in the selling  general and administrative expense that was allocated to our commercial segment primarily due to an increase in consolidated selling  general and administrative expense 
managed broadband segment overview managed broadband segment revenue  cost of goods sold and adjusted ebitda represented  and of consolidated revenues  cost of goods sold and adjusted ebitda  respectively 
managed broadband segment revenues managed broadband segment revenue  which includes data products only  increased to million in as compared to the increase is primarily due to increased monthly contract revenue due to increased data network capacity purchased by our connectmd and schoolaccess customers and absence of million in denied funding from the usac for one connectmd customer for the funding year july to june we received the funding commitment letter  which outlined the denied portion  in the second quarter of the denial has been appealed to the fcc and we cannot predict the likelihood of success 
managed broadband segment cost of goods sold managed broadband segment cost of goods sold increased from million in to million in primarily due to the increase in data network capacity described above in managed broadband segment revenues 
managed broadband segment adjusted ebitda managed broadband segment adjusted ebitda increased to million in primarily due to an increase in revenue as described above in managed broadband segment revenues  partially offset by an increase in the cost of goods sold as described above in managed broadband segment cost of goods sold  and an increase in the selling  general and administrative expense that was allocated to our managed broadband segment 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expense is primarily due to an increase in the consolidated selling  general and administrative expense

regulated operations segment overview regulated operations segment revenue  cost of goods sold and adjusted ebitda represented  and of consolidated revenues  cost of goods sold and adjusted ebitda  respectively 
a selected key performance indicator for our regulated operations segment follows december  percentage change voice total local access lines in service on gci facilities a local access line in service is defined as a revenue generating circuit or channel connecting a customer to the public switched telephone network 
regulated operations segment revenues regulated operations segment revenues decreased from million in to million in regulated operations segment cost of goods sold regulated operations segment cost of goods sold increased from million in to million in beginning july   our regulated segment began purchasing access to carry its traffic in certain regions from our network access segment 
prior to this the traffic in these regions was carried on its own network plant 
under regulatory accounting these intercompany transactions are not eliminated from the consolidated financial statements 
regulated operations segment adjusted ebitda regulated operations segment adjusted ebitda decreased to million in primarily due to a decrease in revenue  an increase in cost of goods sold as described above in regulated operations segment cost of goods sold and an increase in the selling  general and administrative expense that was recorded in our regulated operations segment 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expense is primarily due to non capitalizable terra sw expenses recorded in see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv of this annual report on form k for a reconciliation of consolidated adjusted ebitda  a non gaap financial measure  to consolidated income before income taxes 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million in individually significant items contributing to the increase include a million increase in labor costs  a million increase in health benefit costs  and a million increase in bad debt expense primarily due to absence of settlements which resulted in the release of credit reserves in the third quarter of these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in our company wide success sharing bonus accrual 
the remainder of the increase is comprised of individually insignificant items 
as a percentage of total revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses were in and depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense decreased  to million in other expense  net other expense  net of other income  increased to million in primarily due to a million loss on extinguishment of debt 
on may   gci  inc  our wholly owned subsidiary  completed an offering of million in aggregate principal amount of notes 
we used the net proceeds from this offering to repay and retire all of our outstanding notes 
this increase was partially offset by a million decrease in interest expense to million 
the interest expense decrease is primarily due to the issuance of the notes  which have a lower interest rate than the interest rate paid on our notes 
income tax expense income tax expense totaled million and million in and  respectively 
our effective income tax rate increased from in to in at december   we have income tax net operating loss carryforwards of million that will begin expiring in if not utilized  and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of million available to offset regular income taxes payable in future years 
we have recorded deferred tax assets of million associated with income tax net operating losses that were generated from to and that expire from to  and with charitable contributions that were converted to net operating losses in through  and that expire in through  respectively 
tax benefits associated with recorded deferred tax assets are considered to be more likely than not realizable through future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards 
the amount of deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced which would result in additional income tax expense 
we estimate that our effective annual income tax rate for financial statement purposes will be to in the year ending december   primarily due to the large amount of permanent differences expected in as compared to our net income before income tax expense 
year ended december  compared to year ended december overview of revenues and cost of goods sold total revenues increased from million in to million in revenue increases in our consumer  commercial and managed broadband segments were partially offset by decreased revenue in our network access and regulated operations segments

in the course of business we estimate unbilled long distance services cost of goods sold based upon minutes of use processed through our network and established rates 
such estimates are revised when subsequent billings are received  payments are made  billing matters are researched and resolved  tariffed billing periods lapse  or when disputed charges are resolved  and a  or decrease in long distance costs related to the decrease in minutes carried 
the increase in data cost of goods sold is primarily due to an million or increase in managed services project cost of goods sold related to the increased revenue described above in commercial segment revenues 
the increase in wireless cost of goods sold is primarily due to increased costs for wireless handset equipment sales associated with the increased number of wireless subscribers 
commercial segment adjusted ebitda the adjusted ebitda increase was primarily due to increased revenue as described in commercial segment revenues 
this increase was partially offset by increased cost of goods sold as described in commercial segment cost of goods sold  and an increase in the selling  general and administrative expense that was allocated to our commercial segment primarily due to an increase in consolidated selling  general and administrative expense 
managed broadband segment overview managed broadband segment revenue  cost of goods sold and adjusted ebitda represented  and of consolidated revenues  cost of goods sold and adjusted ebitda  respectively 
managed broadband segment revenues managed broadband segment revenue  which includes data products only  increased to million in as compared to the increase is primarily due to a million or increase in monthly contract revenue due to increased data network capacity purchased by our connectmd and schoolaccess customers  and a million or increase in product sales to our customers 
these increases are partially offset by the million in denied funding from the usac for one connectmd customer for the funding year july to june we received the funding commitment letter  which outlined the denied portion  in the second quarter of this denial is under appeal to the fcc 
managed broadband segment cost of goods sold managed broadband segment cost of goods sold increased from million in to million in the increase is primarily due to the increase in data network capacity described above in managed broadband segment revenues 
in addition  the product sales described above in managed broadband segment revenues resulted in a  or increase in product sales cost of goods sold 
managed broadband segment adjusted ebitda managed broadband segment adjusted ebitda decreased to million in primarily due to an increase in the cost of goods sold as described above in managed broadband segment cost of goods sold  and an increase in the selling  general and administrative expense that was allocated to our managed broadband segment primarily due to an increase in the consolidated selling  general and administrative expense 
these increases were partially offset by an increase in revenue as described above in managed broadband segment revenues

regulated operations segment revenues regulated operations segment revenues decreased from million in to million in primarily due to projected lower levels of eligible cost recovery resulting from changes in lines in service  traffic sensitive activity levels and reserve adjustments 
regulated operations segment cost of goods sold regulated operations segment cost of goods sold decreased from million in to million in primarily due to a change in allocation of network maintenance costs which resulted in a decrease to our regulated operations segment and an increase to our consumer  network access  commercial and managed broadband segments 
regulated operations segment adjusted ebitda regulated operations segment adjusted ebitda increased to million in see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv of this annual report on form k for a reconciliation of consolidated adjusted ebitda  a non gaap financial measure  to consolidated income before income taxes 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million in primarily due to the following a million increase in health benefit costs  a million increase in labor costs  a million increase in share based compensation expense primarily due to the absence of a million reversal of expense in the expense had been properly recognized in previous periods for certain performance based stock options and restricted stock awards but in the third quarter of we determined they were not expected to vest  million in costs  including workers compensation expense  related to an accident involving our company owned aircraft in august  and a  increase in our company wide success sharing bonus accrual 
the increases were partially offset by the following a million decrease in sales expense  the absence of million in costs for the conversion of our customers wireless phones to our facilities in  and the absence of a  contribution expense recognized upon the gift of an iru to the university of alaska that was recorded in as a percentage of total revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to in from in  primarily due to increasing revenues 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense increased million to million in primarily due to new assets placed in service in partially offset by assets which became fully depreciated during other expense  net other expense  net of other income  increased to million in primarily due to a million increase in interest expense to million in the interest expense increase is due to the issuance of the notes in november  which have a higher interest rate than the interest rate paid on our amended senior credit facility  and a higher average outstanding debt balance during than the proceeds from the issuance of the notes were primarily used to repay and retire the outstanding amount due on our amended senior credit facility 
income tax expense income tax expense totaled million and million in and  respectively 
our effective income tax rate decreased from in to in multiple system operator mso operating statistics our operating statistics include capital expenditures and customer information from our consumer and commercial segments which offer services utilizing our cable services facilities 
the standardized definition of a customer relationship is the number of customers that receive at least one level of service utilizing our cable service facilities  encompassing voice  video  and data services  without regard to which services customers purchase 
at december   and we had   and  customer relationships  respectively 
the standardized definition of a revenue generating unit is the sum of all primary digital video  high speed data  and telephony customers  not counting additional outlets 
at december   and we had   and  revenue generating units  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of current liquidity are cash and cash equivalents 
we believe  but can provide no assurances  that we will be able to meet our current and long term liquidity  capital requirements and fixed charges through our cash flows from operating activities  existing cash  cash equivalents  credit facilities  and other external financing and equity sources 
should operating cash flows be insufficient to support additional borrowings and principal payments scheduled under our existing credit facilities  capital expenditures will likely be reduced  which would likely reduce future revenues 
as discussed in the general overview section of this item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the fcc published the high cost order in november the program changes will impact our liquidity minimally in and we are evaluating the impact the program changes will have on our liquidity in later years as the fcc considers successor funding mechanisms 
additionally  in february the fcc released reforms to the usf s lifeline program 
the reforms included a requirement for annual recertification of all lifeline subscribers enrolled as of june  to be completed by the end of we are evaluating this requirement and possible processes and cannot predict whether this new rule will have a material impact on our cash flows 
in january the us department of agriculture s rus approved our wholly owned subsidiary  uui s application for an million loan grant combination to extend terrestrial broadband service for the first time to bristol bay and the yukon kuskokwim delta  an area in alaska roughly the size of the state of north dakota 
this project  called terra sw  was placed into service in december and will be able to serve over  households and over businesses in the covered communities 
the network facility will also be able to serve numerous public nonprofit private community anchor institutions and entities  such as regional health care providers  school districts  and other regional and alaska native organizations 
the rus award  consisting of a million loan and a million grant  is made under the rus broadband initiatives program established pursuant to the american recovery and reinvestment act 
the award funds backbone network facilities that we would not otherwise be able to construct within our return on investment requirements 
on may   gci  inc  our wholly owned subsidiary  completed an offering of million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due notes at an issue price of

the supplement no 
provided for an additional million term loan with an initial interest rate of libor plus  payable in accordance with the terms of our senior credit facility 
holdings used million of the term loan proceeds to pay down outstanding revolving loans under our senior credit facility  thus increasing availability under the revolving portion of our senior credit facility 
the remaining million was used for general corporate purposes

the remaining million was used for general corporate purposes 
on august   we entered into a financing arrangement under the nmtc program that provided million in net cash to help fund the extension of terrestrial broadband service for the first time to rural northwestern alaska communities via a high capacity hybrid fiber optic and microwave network 
when completed  the project  called terra nw  will connect to the terra sw network and provide a high capacity backbone connection from the served communities to the internet 
in september  the rca approved our application for a million grant to help fund terra nw 
the grant was increased to million in january the nmtc arrangement discussed above and this grant award partially fund backbone network facilities that we would not otherwise be able to construct within our return on investment requirements 
we plan to fund an additional million for terra nw and begin construction in and expect to complete the project in or earlier if possible 
while our short term and long term financing abilities are believed to be adequate as a supplement to internally generated cash flows to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions as opportunities arise  turmoil in the global financial markets may negatively impact our ability to further access the capital markets in a timely manner and on attractive terms  which may have a negative impact on our ability to grow our business 
we monitor the third party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents 
our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds 
our net cash flows provided by and used for operating  investing and financing activities  as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows for and  are summarized as follows amounts in thousands operating activities investing activities financing activities net decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities the decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities is due primarily to an increase in accounts receivable in as compared to due to timing of receipt of payments 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities consists primarily of cash paid for capital expenditures 
our most significant recurring investing activity has been capital expenditures and we expect that this will continue in the future 
a significant portion of our capital expenditures is based on the level of customer growth and the technology being deployed 
our cash expenditures for property and equipment  including construction in progress  totaled million and million during and  respectively 
our capital expenditures increased in primarily due to our terra sw project 
we recovered a substantial portion of our terra sw capital expenditures through grant funds and loan draws under our terra sw rus award 
we expect our expenditures for property and equipment for our core operations  including construction in progress  to total approximately million  depending on available opportunities and the amount of cash flow we generate during under our terra sw rus award  we had total available grant funds of million 
we have received million in grant funds during the year ended december   leaving million remaining grant funds available as of december  we have a million grant fund receivable recorded as of december  on january   we received an additional million under the grant portion of the award 
after consideration of this transaction  we have million remaining grant funds available 
in  we received million in cash from participating in an nmtc financing transaction 
the cash is restricted for construction of terra nw 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities in consists primarily of proceeds from the issuance of our notes and supplements no 
and no 
under our senior credit facility  borrowing under the revolving portion of our senior credit facility  borrowing under our terra sw rus loan and an investment by us bancorp  a non controlling interest 
these proceeds were offset by retirement of our notes and repayments under the revolving portion of our senior credit facility  payment of debt issuance costs and repurchases of our common stock 
proceeds from borrowings fluctuate from year to year based on our liquidity needs 
we may use excess cash to make optional repayments on our debt or repurchase our common stock depending on various factors  such as market conditions 
available borrowings under senior credit facility our senior credit facility  which at december  includes the supplements no 
and no 
as discussed above  includes a million term loan and a million revolving credit facility with a million sublimit for letters of credit 
the term loan is fully drawn and a total of million is outstanding as of december  under the revolving portion of the senior credit facility  we have borrowed million and have  of letters of credit outstanding  which leaves million available for borrowing as of december  available terra sw borrowings under rus under our terra sw rus award  we had total available loan funds of million 
we have borrowed million in loan funds  leaving million remaining loan funds available as of december  on january   we received an additional million under the loan portion of the award 
after consideration of this transaction  we have million remaining loan funds available 
debt covenants we are subject to covenants and restrictions set forth in the indentures governing our and notes  senior credit facility  rus loans  and cobank loans 
we are in compliance with the covenants  and we believe that neither the covenants nor the restrictions in our indentures or loan documents will limit our ability to operate our business 
share repurchases gci s board of directors has authorized a common stock buyback program for the repurchase of gci class a and class b common stock in order to reduce the outstanding shares of class a and class b common stock 
under this program  we are currently authorized to make up to million of repurchases as of december  we are authorized to increase our repurchase limit million per quarter indefinitely and to use stock option exercise proceeds to repurchase additional shares 
if stock repurchases are less than the total approved quarterly amount the difference may be carried forward and applied against future stock repurchases 
during we repurchased million shares of gci common stock under the stock buyback program at a cost of million 
the common stock buyback program is expected to continue for an indefinite period dependent on leverage  liquidity  company performance  market conditions and subject to continued oversight by gci s board of directors 
the open market repurchases have and will continue to comply with the restrictions of sec rule b schedule of certain known contractual obligations the following table details future projected payments associated with certain known contractual obligations as of december  amounts in thousands payments due by period total less than year to years to years more than years long term debt interest on long term debt capital lease obligations  including interest operating lease commitments purchase obligations total contractual obligations long term debt listed in the table above includes principal payments on our senior credit facility  and notes  rural utilities services debt and cobank mortgage note payable 
interest on the amount outstanding under our senior credit facility is based on variable rates 
we used the current rate paid on the senior credit facility to estimate our future interest payments 
our notes require semi annual interest payments of million through november and our notes require semi annual interest payments of million through june our rural utilities services debt and cobank mortgage note payable have fixed interest rates ranging from to

purchase obligations include the following a non cancelable commitment to purchase wireless equipment of million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively  and cancelable open purchase orders for goods and services for capital projects and normal operations totaling million which are not included in our consolidated balance sheets at december   because the goods had not been received or the services had not been performed at december  off balance sheet arrangements we have not created  and are not party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital  incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated into our financial statements 
we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into our financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of our capital resources 
new accounting standards in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic 
the amendments in this update will allow an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
under these amendments  an entity would not be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines  based on a qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
the amendments include a number of events and circumstances for an entity to consider in conducting the qualitative assessment 
this pronouncement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of asu is not expected to have a material impact on our income statements  financial position or cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued asu fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs which amends current guidance to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in gaap and ifrs 
the amendments generally represent clarification of fasb asc topic  but also include instances where a particular principle or requirement for measuring fair value or disclosing information about fair value measurements has changed 
this pronouncement is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  the adoption of asu is not expected to have a material impact on our income statements  financial position or cash flows 
critical accounting policies and estimates our accounting and reporting policies comply with gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
the financial position and results of operations can be affected by these estimates and assumptions  which are integral to understanding reported results 
critical accounting policies are those policies that management believes are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and require management to make estimates that are difficult  subjective or complex 
most accounting policies are not considered by management to be critical accounting policies 
several factors are considered in determining whether or not a policy is critical in the preparation of financial statements 
these factors include  among other things  whether the estimates are significant to the financial statements  the nature of the estimates  the ability to readily validate the estimates with other information including third parties or available prices  and sensitivity of the estimates to changes in economic conditions and whether alternative accounting methods may be utilized under gaap 
for all of these policies  management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
management has discussed the development and the selection of critical accounting policies with our audit committee 
those policies and estimates considered to be critical for the year ended december  are described below 
revenue recognition the accounting estimates related to revenues from the remote high cost  rural health and schools and libraries usf programs are dependent on various inputs including our estimate of the statewide support cap  our assessment of the impact of new fcc regulations  the potential outcome of fcc proceedings and the potential outcome of usac contract reviews 
some of the inputs are subjective and based on our judgment regarding the outcome of certain variables and are subject to upward or downward adjustment in subsequent periods 
significant changes to our estimates could result in material changes to the revenues we have recorded and could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
allowance for doubtful receivables we maintain allowances for doubtful receivables for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we also maintain an allowance for doubtful receivables based on notification that a customer may not have satisfactorily complied with rules necessary to obtain supplemental funding from the usac for services provided by us under our packaged communications offerings to rural hospitals  health clinics and school districts 
we base our estimates on the aging of our accounts receivable balances  financial health of specific customers  regional economic data  changes in our collections process  regulatory requirements  and our customers compliance with usac rules 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate or if they are unable to emerge from reorganization proceedings  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
if their financial condition improves or they emerge successfully from reorganization proceedings  allowances may be reduced 
such allowance changes could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
impairment and useful lives of intangible assets we had million of indefinite lived intangible assets at december  consisting of cable certificates of million  goodwill of million and wireless licenses of million 
our indefinite lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment during the fourth quarter and at any time upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances 
we are required to determine goodwill impairment using a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill that would be recognized in a business combination 
the impairment test for identifiable indefinite lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
our cable certificates are our largest indefinite lived intangible asset and represent agreements with government entities to construct and operate a cable business 
the value of our cable certificates is derived from the economic benefits we receive from the right to solicit new customers and to market new services 
the amount we have recorded for cable certificates is primarily from cable system acquisitions 
the cable certificates are valued under a direct discounted cash flow method whereby the cash flow associated with existing customers is isolated after appropriate contributory asset charges and then projected based on an analysis of customer churn and attrition characteristics 
our wireless licenses are from the fcc and give us the right to provide wireless service within a certain geographical area 
the amount we have recorded is from acquisitions of wireless companies and auctions of wireless spectrum 
we use comparable market transactions from recent fcc auctions  as appropriate  and a hypothetical build up method to value our wireless licenses 
goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired in connection with a business acquisition 
we use an income approach to determine the fair value of our reporting units for purposes of our goodwill impairment test 
in addition  a market based approach is used where possible to corroborate the fair values determined by the income approach 
the direct discounted cash flow  hypothetical build up  and income approach valuation methods require us to make estimates and assumptions including projected cash flows  discount rate  customer churn  and customer behaviors and attrition 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of any such impairment charge 
fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time  based on relevant information 
these estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision 
changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates 
events and factors that may be out of our control that could affect the estimates include such things as competitive forces  customer behaviors  change in revenue growth trends  cost structures and technology  and changes in discount rates  performance compared to peers  material and ongoing negative economic trends  and specific industry or market sector conditions 
our company is operated and managed with two balance sheets  however  our impairment tests must be performed at the reporting unit level  which requires us to allocate one of our balance sheets 
these allocations are subjective and require a significant amount of judgment 
changes to the assumptions and allocation methodologies could significantly change our estimates 
we may also record impairments in the future if there are changes in long term market conditions  expected future operating results  or laws and regulations that may prevent us from recovering the carrying value of our goodwill  cable certificates  and wireless licenses 
we have allocated all of the goodwill to our reporting units and based on our annual impairment test as of october   the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the book value by a range between and 
the reporting unit that exceeded the book value by passed the goodwill impairment test by million  which we believe is a large margin 
we believe none of our reporting units were close to failing step one of the goodwill impairment test 
based on our annual impairment test as of october   the fair value of our wireless licenses exceeded the book value by and million  which we believe is a large margin 
the fair value of our cable certificates exceeded the book value by and million as of october  the fair values of our wireless licenses and cable certificates were negatively affected by the fcc s issuance of the high cost order discussed in the general overview section of this item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as it decreased current and forecasted wireless and local services revenue 
the wireless revenue decreases affected wireless licenses and the local services revenue decreases affected cable certificates as our local customers are mainly serviced using our cable plant 
we believe that none of our indefinite lived intangible assets were close to failing the impairment test  however  as discussed in the general overview section of this item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  further rulemaking to consider successor funding mechanisms is underway at the fcc 
we cannot predict at this time the outcome of this proceeding or its effect on us  but our revenue for providing wireless and local services in these areas would be materially adversely affected by a substantial reduction of usf support 
accruals for unbilled costs we estimate unbilled long distance and wireless services cost of goods sold based upon minutes of use carried through our network and established rates 
we estimate unbilled costs for new circuits and services  and network changes that result in traffic routing changes or a change in carriers 
carriers that provide service to us regularly make network changes that can lead to new  revised or corrected billings 
such estimates are revised or removed when subsequent billings are received  payments are made  billing matters are researched and resolved  tariffed billing periods lapse  or when disputed charges are resolved 
revisions to previous estimates could either increase or decrease costs in the year in which the estimate is revised which could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
valuation allowance for net operating loss deferred tax assets our income tax policy provides for deferred income taxes to show the effect of temporary differences between the recognition of revenue and expenses for financial and income tax reporting purposes and between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
we have recorded deferred tax assets of million associated with income tax net operating losses that were generated from to  and that primarily expire from to  and with charitable contributions that were converted to net operating losses in to  and that expire in to  respectively 
pre acquisition income tax net operating losses associated with acquired companies are subject to additional deductibility limits 
we have recorded deferred tax assets of million associated with alternative minimum tax credits that do not expire 
significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that may be required against the deferred tax assets 
we have not recorded a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets as of december  based on management s belief that future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and estimated future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards will  more likely than not  be sufficient to realize the benefit of these assets over time 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or if our historical trends change  we may be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
other significant accounting policies  not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above  are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements 
a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies can be found in note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
regulatory developments see part i item business regulation for more information about regulatory developments affecting us 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has a significant effect on our operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of business  including the impact of interest rate changes 
our senior credit facility carries interest rate risk 
amounts borrowed under this agreement bear interest at libor plus or less depending upon our total leverage ratio as defined for the revolving portion and libor plus for the term portion 
should the libor rate change  our interest expense will increase or decrease accordingly 
as of december   we have borrowed million subject to interest rate risk 
on this amount  each increase in the libor interest rate would result in  of additional gross interest cost on an annualized basis 
all of our other material borrowings have a fixed interest rate 
we do not hold derivatives for trading purposes
