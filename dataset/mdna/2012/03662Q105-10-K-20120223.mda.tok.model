these contracts are generally renewed on an annual basis and typically have a high rate of customer renewal 
in addition to the recurring revenue base associated with these contracts  a majority of customers purchasing new perpetual licenses also purchase related annual maintenance contracts 
as a result of the significant recurring revenue base  the company s license and maintenance revenue growth rate in any period does not necessarily correlate to the growth rate of new license and maintenance contracts sold during that period 
to the extent the rate of customer renewal for lease and maintenance contracts is high  incremental lease contracts  and maintenance contracts sold with new perpetual licenses  will result in license and maintenance revenue growth 
conversely  if the rate of renewal for these contracts is adversely affected by economic or other factors  the company s license and maintenance growth will be adversely affected over the term that the revenue for those contracts would have otherwise been recognized

table of contents non gaap measures management uses non gaap financial measures a to evaluate the company s historical and prospective financial performance as well as its performance relative to its competitors  b to set internal sales targets and spending budgets  c to allocate resources  d to measure operational profitability and the accuracy of forecasting  e to assess financial discipline over operational expenditures and f as an important factor in determining variable compensation for management and its employees 
in addition  many financial analysts that follow the company focus on and publish both historical results and future projections based on non gaap financial measures 
the company believes that it is in the best interest of its investors to provide this information to analysts so that they accurately report the non gaap financial information 
moreover  investors have historically requested and the company has historically reported these non gaap financial measures as a means of providing consistent and comparable information with past reports of financial results 
while management believes that these non gaap financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors  there are limitations associated with the use of these non gaap financial measures 
these non gaap financial measures are not prepared in accordance with gaap  are not reported by all of the company s competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of the company s competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation 
the company compensates for these limitations by using these non gaap financial measures as supplements to gaap financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the non gaap financial measures to their most comparable gaap financial measures 
the adjustments to these non gaap financial measures  and the basis for such adjustments  are outlined below acquisition accounting for deferred revenue and its related tax impact 
historically  the company has consummated acquisitions in order to support its strategic and other business objectives 
in accordance with the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations  acquired deferred revenue is often recorded on the opening balance sheet at an amount that is lower than the historical carrying value 
although this purchase accounting requirement has no impact on the company s business or cash flow  it adversely impacts the company s reported gaap revenue in the reporting periods following an acquisition 
in order to provide investors with financial information that facilitates comparison of both historical and future results  the company provides non gaap financial measures which exclude the impact of the acquisition accounting adjustment 
the company believes that this non gaap financial adjustment is useful to investors because it allows investors to a evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in its financial and operational decision making and b compare past and future reports of financial results of the company as the revenue reduction related to acquired deferred revenue will not recur when related annual lease licenses and software maintenance contracts are renewed in future periods 
amortization of intangibles from acquisitions and its related tax impact 
the company incurs amortization of intangibles  included in its gaap presentation of amortization expense  related to various acquisitions it has made in recent years 
management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non gaap operating income  non gaap operating profit margin  non gaap net income and non gaap diluted earnings per share when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the company because these costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition  are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition 
accordingly  management does not consider these expenses for purposes of evaluating the performance of the company during the applicable time period after the acquisition  and it excludes such expenses when making decisions to allocate resources 
the company believes that these non gaap financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to a evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in its financial and operational decision making and b compare past reports of financial results of the company as the company has historically reported these non gaap financial measures 

table of contents stock based compensation expense and its related tax impact 
the company incurs expense related to stock based compensation included in its gaap presentation of cost of software licenses  cost of maintenance and service  research and development expense and selling  general and administrative expense 
although stock based compensation is an expense of the company and viewed as a form of compensation  management excludes these expenses for the purpose of calculating non gaap operating income  non gaap operating profit margin  non gaap net income and non gaap diluted earnings per share when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the company 
specifically  the company excludes stock based compensation during its annual budgeting process and its quarterly and annual assessments of the company s and management s performance 
the annual budgeting process is the primary mechanism whereby the company allocates resources to various initiatives and operational requirements 
additionally  the annual review by the board of directors during which it compares the company s historical business model and profitability to the planned business model and profitability for the forthcoming year excludes the impact of stock based compensation 
in evaluating the performance of senior management and department managers  charges related to stock based compensation are excluded from expenditure and profitability results 
in fact  the company records stock based compensation expense into a stand alone cost center for which no single operational manager is responsible or accountable 
in this way  management is able to review  on a period to period basis  each manager s performance and assess financial discipline over operational expenditures without the effect of stock based compensation 
the company believes that these non gaap financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to a evaluate the company s operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by management to review the company s operating results  and b review historical comparability in its financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors operating results 
transaction costs related to business combinations 
the company incurs expenses for professional services rendered in connection with business combinations  which are included in its gaap presentation of selling  general and administrative expense 
these expenses are generally not tax deductible 
management excludes these acquisition related transaction costs for the purpose of calculating non gaap operating income  non gaap operating profit margin  non gaap net income and non gaap diluted earnings per share when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the company  as it generally would not have otherwise incurred these expenses in the periods presented as a part of its continuing operations 
the company believes that these non gaap financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to a evaluate the company s operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by management to review the company s operating results  and b review historical comparability in its financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors operating results 
non gaap financial measures are not in accordance with  or an alternative for  generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the company s non gaap financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable gaap financial measures  and should be read only in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap 
the company has provided a reconciliation of the non gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures as listed below gaap reporting measure non gaap reporting measure revenue non gaap revenue operating income non gaap operating income operating profit margin non gaap operating profit margin net income non gaap net income diluted earnings per share non gaap diluted earnings per share

table of contents december  total capital spending was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  in  maturities of short term investments exceeded purchases by million 
the company currently plans capital spending of approximately million to million during fiscal year however  the level of spending will be dependent upon various factors  including growth of the business and the employee base  and general economic conditions 
the company s investing activities used net cash of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  total capital spending was million in and million in in  maturing short term investments exceeded purchases by million 
in  purchases of short term investments exceeded maturities by million 
cash flows from financing activities financing activities used cash of million and million for the fiscal years ended december  and  respectively 
this change of million was primarily the result of a million decrease in principal payments on long term debt in the period as compared to the period  partially offset by million spent in to repurchase  shares of treasury stock pursuant to the company s stock repurchase program at an average price of per share 
there were no repurchases of treasury stock in the period 
financing activities used cash of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively

the company did not repurchase any stock in also contributing to the change was an million increase in principal payments on long term debt in as compared to these changes were partially offset by additional proceeds of million in from the exercise of stock options 
the company s term loan includes covenants related to the consolidated leverage ratio and the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio  as well as certain restrictions on additional investments and indebtedness 
as of december   the company is in compliance with all financial covenants as stated in the credit agreement 
as of december   million shares remain authorized for repurchase under the company s stock repurchase program 
although the company has repurchased stock during the years ended december  and  it may or may not do so in future periods 
the company believes that existing cash and cash equivalent balances of million  together with cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet the company s working capital  capital expenditure and debt service requirements through the next twelve months 
the company s cash requirements in the future may also be financed through additional equity or debt financings 
there can be no assurance that such financings can be obtained on favorable terms  if at all 
the company continues to generate positive cash flows from operating activities and believes that the best use of its excess cash is to repay its long term debt  to invest in the business and  under certain favorable conditions  to repurchase stock 
additionally  the company has in the past and expects in the future to acquire or make investments in complementary companies  products  services and technologies 
any future acquisitions may be funded by available cash and investments  cash generated from operations  existing or additional credit facilities  or from the issuance of additional securities 
the company has a million line of credit available on a purchase card

in addition to the favorable impact on operating cash flows of approximately million that is discussed above  the merger of the company s japan subsidiaries is expected to favorably impact the company s cash flow from operations in future periods as follows estimated future cash flow savings fiscal year million per year fiscal year million per year fiscal year million per year fiscal year million uncertain timing million total future benefits million with respect to the amounts in the preceding table whereby the timing is listed as uncertain  the company previously estimated that there would be million of additional us cash flow benefits in the company continues to expect that it will realize these cash flow benefits  however  the timing of these cash flows is now reflected as uncertain because the realization of these benefits is affected by the resolution of any administrative reviews by the internal revenue service irs of the company s amended tax return refund claims 
in the first quarter of  the company filed an amended tax return for a different matter seeking a less significant benefit than the one sought related to the restructuring of its japanese subsidiaries 
the irs initiated an audit of this amended filing that will prevent the company from realizing the cash flow benefits of the amended filing until the audit is completed 
due to the size of the benefit included on the amended return associated with the restructuring of its japanese subsidiaries  the company similarly expects that the irs will initiate an audit  thus making the timing of the receipt of these refunds not predictable with certainty

other operating leases primarily include noncancellable lease commitments for the company s other domestic and international offices as well as certain operating equipment 
unconditional purchase obligations primarily include software licenses and long term purchase contracts for network  communication and office maintenance services  which are unrecorded as of december  the company has approximately million of unrecognized tax benefits  including estimated interest and penalties  that have been recorded as liabilities in accordance with income tax accounting guidance for which the company is uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the company believes that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue is derived principally from the licensing of computer software products and from related maintenance contracts 
revenue from perpetual licenses is classified as license revenue and is recognized upon delivery of the licensed product and the utility that enables the customer to access authorization keys  provided that acceptance has occurred and a signed contractual obligation has been received  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility of the receivable is probable 
the company determines the fair value of post contract customer support pcs sold together with perpetual licenses based on the rate charged for pcs when sold separately 
revenue from pcs contracts is classified as maintenance and service revenue and is recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
revenue for software lease licenses is classified as license revenue and is recognized over the period of the lease contract 
typically  the company s software leases include pcs which  due to the short term principally one year or less of the company s software lease licenses  cannot be separated from lease revenue for accounting purposes 
as a result  both the lease license and pcs are recognized ratably over the lease period 
due to the short term nature of the software lease licenses and the frequency with which the company provides major product upgrades typically every months  the company does not believe that a significant portion of the fee paid under the arrangement is attributable to the pcs component of the arrangement and  as a result  includes the revenue for the entire arrangement within software license revenue in the consolidated statements of income 
revenue from training  support and other services is recognized as the services are performed 
the company applies the specific performance method to contracts in which the service consists of a single act  such as providing a training class to a customer  and the proportional performance method to other service contracts that are longer in duration and often include multiple acts for example  both training and consulting 
in applying the proportional performance method  the company typically utilizes output based estimates for services with contractual billing arrangements that are not based on time and materials  and estimates output based on the total tasks completed as compared to the total tasks required for each work contract 
input based estimates are utilized for services that involve general consultations with contractual billing arrangements based on time and materials  utilizing direct labor as the input measure 
the company also executes arrangements through independent channel partners in which the channel partners are authorized to market and distribute the company s software products to end users of the company s products and services in specified territories 
in sales facilitated by channel partners  the channel partner bears the risk of collection from the end user customer 
the company recognizes revenue from transactions with channel partners when the channel partner submits a written purchase commitment  collectibility from the channel partner is probable  a signed license agreement is received from the end user customer and delivery has occurred  provided that all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 
revenue from channel partner transactions is the amount remitted to the company by the channel partners 
this amount includes a fee for pcs that is compensation for providing technical enhancements and the second level of technical support to the end user  which is based on the rate charged for pcs when sold separately  and is recognized over the period that pcs is to be provided 
the company does not offer right of return  product rotation or price protection to any of its channel partners 
non income related taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are recorded on the balance sheet as accounts receivable and accrued expenses 
the collection and payment of these amounts are reported on a net basis in the consolidated statements of income and do not impact reported revenues or expenses 
the company warrants to its customers that its software will substantially perform as specified in the company s most current user manuals 
the company has not experienced significant claims related to software 
table of contents warranties beyond the scope of maintenance support  which the company is already obligated to provide  and consequently  the company has not established reserves for warranty obligations 
the company s agreements with its customers generally require it to indemnify the customer against claims that the company s software infringes third party patent  copyright  trademark or other proprietary rights 
such indemnification obligations are generally limited in a variety of industry standard respects  including the company s right to replace an infringing product 
as of december   the company had not experienced any losses related to these indemnification obligations and no claims with respect thereto were outstanding 
the company does not expect significant claims related to these indemnification obligations  and consequently  the company has not established any related reserves 
the company makes judgments as to its ability to collect outstanding receivables and provides allowances for a portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful 
provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices from both value and delinquency perspectives 
for those invoices not specifically reviewed  provisions are provided at differing rates based upon the age of the receivable and the geographic area of origin 
in determining these percentages  the company considers its historical collection experience and current economic trends in the customer s industry and geographic region 
if the historical data used to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and future results of operations could be materially affected 
the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period of the enactment date 
the company records net deferred tax assets to the extent it believes these assets will more likely than not be realized 
in making such determination  the company considers all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial operations 
in the event the company determines that it will be able to realize deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be recorded that would reduce the provision for income taxes 
tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more likely than not threshold 
otherwise  these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled  which means that the statute of limitations has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed their examination even though the statute of limitations remains open 
the company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the income tax expense line in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheets 
the company tests goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually by comparing the fair value of each asset or  in the case of goodwill  the company s reporting units to its carrying value 
fair value is estimated using discounted cash flow and other valuation methodologies 
in preparing the estimate of fair value  the company relies on a number of factors  including historical operating results  business plans  anticipated future cash flows  economic projections and other market data 
because there are inherent uncertainties involved in these factors  the company s estimates of fair value are imprecise and the resulting carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets may be misstated 
when the company assigns a fair value to a trademark  it also estimates whether it has a finite or indefinite life  thus impacting whether the value is amortized or not 
events such as product and naming strategy changes can occur whereby the company may 
table of contents reconsider the life whether finite or indefinite  resulting in changes to amortization expense 
amortization periods may also be reconsidered for identifiable intangible assets with finite lives 
on january   the company completed the annual impairment test for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives and determined that these assets had not been impaired 
as of this date  the fair value of the company s reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying value 
prior to the august  acquisition of apache  the company had only one reporting unit 
the key assumptions utilized in determining the fair value of the company s reporting units are revenue growth rates  growth rates of cash expenditures and related operating margin percentages  income tax rates  and factors that influence the company s weighted average cost of capital  including interest rates  the ratio of the company s debt capital to its total capital and the company s systematic risk or beta 
of the preceding factors  the fair values of the company s reporting units are most sensitive to changes in revenue growth rate estimates 
factors that could adversely affect the company s revenue growth rates include adverse economic conditions in certain geographies or industries  especially key industrial and electronics industries  enhanced competition and related pricing pressures  integration issues associated with acquisitions  strengthening of the us dollar or other adverse foreign currency fluctuations  reduced renewal rates for the company s annual lease and maintenance contracts  and the company s ability to attract and retain key personnel 
any of these factors individually or in combination could cause the company s growth rates to decline over a defined period of time 
the company has demonstrated an ability in the past to adjust its cost structure through reductions in discretionary spending  delayed hiring or workforce reductions when faced with periods of reduced revenue growth 
if adverse conditions would persist over a longer period of time and would cause a revision to the company s long term revenue growth rate projections without a similar cost reduction response  or if other factors would occur that would result in a similar growth rate revision or a material revision to the other inputs to reporting unit fair value  it could cause the fair value of the company s reporting unit to fall below its carrying value  potentially resulting in an impairment of goodwill 
the company is involved in various investigations  claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business including alleged infringement of intellectual property rights  commercial disputes  labor and employment matters  tax audits and other matters 
the company reviews the status of these matters  assesses its financial exposure and records a related accrual if the potential loss from an investigation  claim or legal proceeding is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable 
significant judgment is involved in the determination of probability and in the determination of whether an exposure is reasonably estimable 
as a result of the uncertainties involved in making these estimates  the company may have to revise its estimates as facts and circumstances change 
the revision of these estimates could have a material impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
the company grants options to purchase its common stock to employees and directors under the company s stock option plan 
eligible employees can also purchase shares of the company s common stock at a discount under the company s employee stock purchase plan 
the benefits provided under these plans are share based payments subject to the provisions of share based payment accounting guidance 
the company uses the fair value method to apply the provisions of share based payment accounting guidance

no options issued associated with the acquisition were fully vested as of the acquisition date 

table of contents the value of each share based award was estimated on the date of grant or date of acquisition for options issued in a business combination using the black scholes option pricing model black scholes model 
the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards using an option pricing model is affected by the company s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include the company s expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rates and expected dividends 
the table below presents the weighted average input assumptions used and resulting fair values for options granted or issued in business combinations during each respective year 
the stock based compensation expense for options is recorded ratably over their requisite service period

year ended december  risk free interest rate to to to expected dividend yield expected volatility expected term years years years weighted average fair value per share the company issues both nonqualified and incentive stock options  however  incentive stock options comprise a significant portion of outstanding stock options 
the tax benefits associated with incentive stock options are unpredictable  as they are predicated upon an award recipient triggering an event that disqualifies the award and that then results in a tax deduction to the company 
share based payment accounting guidance requires that these tax benefits be recorded at the time of the triggering event 
the triggering events for each option holder are not easily projected 
in order to estimate the tax benefits related to incentive stock options  the company makes many assumptions and estimates  including the number of incentive stock options that will be exercised during the period by us employees  the number of incentive stock options that will be disqualified during the period and the fair market value of the company s stock price on the exercise dates 
each of these items is subject to significant uncertainty 
additionally  a significant portion of the tax benefits related to disqualified incentive stock options is accounted for as an increase to equity additional paid in capital rather than as a reduction in income tax expense 
although all such benefits continue to be realized through the company s tax filings  this accounting treatment has the effect of increasing tax expense and reducing net income 
for example  the company realized a tax benefit of million during the year ended december  related to disqualified dispositions of incentive stock options  however  only million of such amount was recorded as a reduction in income tax expense 
under the terms of the ansys  inc long term incentive plan  in the first quarter of and  the company granted  and  performance based restricted stock units  respectively 
vesting of the full award or a portion thereof is based on the company s performance as measured by total shareholder return relative to the median percentage appreciation of the nasdaq composite index over a specified measurement period  subject to each participant s continued employment with the company through the conclusion of the measurement period 
the measurement period for the restricted stock units granted pursuant to the long term incentive plan is a three year period beginning january of the year of the grant 
each restricted stock unit relates to one share of the company s common stock 
the value of each restricted stock unit granted in was estimated on the grant date to be and the value of each restricted stock unit granted in was estimated on the grant date to be 
the estimate of the grant date value of the restricted stock units was made using a monte carlo lattice pricing model 
the determination of the fair value of the awards was affected by the grant date and a number of variables  each of which has been identified in the chart below 
share based compensation expense based on the fair value of the award is being recorded from the grant date through the conclusion of the three year measurement period

the deferred stock units are issued in arrears and vest immediately  with the exception of the chairman s units which are issued in the period earned 
as of december    deferred stock units have been earned with the underlying shares remaining unissued until the service termination of the respective director owners 
of this amount   units were earned during the year ended december  in addition  in the second quarter of   deferred stock units were issued as a result of the termination of service of a director  for which  units were earned during the calendar year 
if factors change and the company employs different assumptions in the application of share based payment accounting guidance in future periods  the compensation expense that the company will record may differ significantly from what the company has recorded in the current period 
therefore  it is important for investors to be aware of the high degree of subjectivity involved when using option pricing models to estimate share based compensation 
option pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions  are fully transferable and do not cause dilution 
because the company s share based payments have characteristics significantly different from those of freely traded options and because changes in the input assumptions can materially affect the company s estimates of fair values  in the company s opinion  existing valuation models may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of the company s share based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that the company s estimates of the fair values of the company s share based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination or forfeiture of those share based payments in the future 
certain share based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in the company s financial statements 
alternatively  value may be realized from these instruments that is significantly in excess of the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in the company s financial statements 
there is currently no market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models  nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values 
although the fair value of employee share based awards is determined in accordance with share based payment accounting guidance using an option pricing model  that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer seller market transaction 
estimates of share based compensation expenses are significant to the company s financial statements  but these expenses are based on the aforementioned option valuation models and will never result in the payment of cash by the company 
for this reason  and because the company does not view share based compensation as related to its operational performance  the board of directors and management exclude estimated share based compensation expense when evaluating the company s underlying business performance

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest income rate risk 
changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest income that is generated from the company s cash and short term investments 
for the year ended december   total interest income was million 
cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of highly liquid investments such as money market mutual funds and deposits held at major banks 
interest expense rate risk 
in connection with the ansoft acquisition  the company entered into a million term loan with variable interest rates as of july  the term loan is scheduled to mature on july  and provides for tiered pricing with the initial rate at the prime rate  or the libor rate  with step downs permitted after the initial six months under the credit agreement down to a flat prime rate or the libor rate 
such tiered pricing is determined by the company s consolidated leverage ratio 
the credit agreement includes quarterly financial covenants  requiring the company to maintain certain financial ratios and  as is customary for facilities of this type  certain events of default that permit the acceleration of the loan 
borrowings outstanding under this facility totaled million as of december  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement in order to hedge a portion of each of the first eight forecasted quarterly variable rate interest payments on the company s term loan 
under the swap agreement  the company received the variable  three month libor rate required under its term loan and paid a fixed libor interest rate of on the notional amount 
the initial notional amount of million was amortized equally at an amount of million per quarter over eight quarters through june  the interest rate swap agreement terminated on june  for the year ended december   the company recorded interest expense related to the term loan at a weighted average interest rate of 
for the year ended december   the company recorded interest expense related to the term loan at a weighted average interest rate of 
if the company did not enter into the interest rate swap agreement  the weighted average interest rate would have been 
for the year ended december   the company recorded interest expense related to the term loan at a weighted average interest rate of 
if the company did not enter into the interest rate swap agreement  the weighted average interest rate would have been 
the interest expense on the term loan and amortization related to debt financing costs were as follows year ended december  in thousands interest expense amortization interest expense amortization interest expense amortization july  term loan interest expense includes loss  loss and  loss  respectively  on interest rate swap the interest rate on the outstanding term loan balance of million is set for the quarter ending march  at  which is based on the libor rate 
as of december   the fair value of the debt approximated the recorded value 
based on the effective interest rates and remaining outstanding borrowings at december   a increase in interest rates would not impact the company s interest expense for the quarter ending march  based on the effective interest rates and remaining outstanding borrowings at december   assuming contractual quarterly principal payments are made  a increase in interest rates would increase the company s interest expense by approximately  for the year ending december  
table of contents foreign currency transaction risk 
as the company continues to expand its business presence in international regions  the portion of its revenue  expenses  cash  accounts receivable and payment obligations denominated in foreign currencies continues to increase 
as a result  changes in currency exchange rates will affect the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the company is most impacted by movements in and among the british pound  euro  japanese yen  canadian dollar  indian rupee  swedish krona  chinese renminbi  korean won  taiwan dollar and the us dollar 
with respect to revenue  on average for the year ended december   the us dollar was approximately weaker  when measured against the company s primary foreign currencies  than for the year ended december  the net overall weakening resulted in increased revenue and operating income during  as compared with  of approximately million and million  respectively 
the company s operating results are favorably impacted when the us dollar weakens against the company s primary foreign currencies and are adversely impacted when the us dollar strengthens against the company s primary foreign currencies 
had the activity for the year ended december  been recorded at the december  spot rates for each subsidiary s functional currency  the revenue and operating income for the year would have decreased by million and million  respectively 
the most significant currency impacts on revenue and operating income were primarily attributable to us dollar exchange rate changes against the euro  british pound and japanese yen  as reflected in the charts below period end exchange rates as of eur usd gbp usd usd jpy december  december  december  december  average exchange rates twelve months ended eur usd gbp usd usd jpy december  december  december  the company has foreign currency denominated intercompany payables receivables with certain foreign subsidiaries 
in order to provide a natural hedge  the company will purchase foreign currencies and hold these currencies in cash until the intercompany payables receivables are settled 
these natural hedges mitigate a portion of the foreign currency exchange risk on the intercompany payables receivables
