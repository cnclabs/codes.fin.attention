item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our accompanying consolidated financial statements  including the related notes 
this discussion generally refers to elements within our accompanying consolidated financial statements on a pre tax basis unless otherwise stated 
except for historical information  the discussions in this section contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those discussed below 
for further information regarding risks and uncertainties  see item a 
entitled risk factors in this annual report on form k 
overview we focus our design  development  manufacturing and marketing efforts on the high performance analog and mixed signal segment of the semiconductor market 
digital and analog semiconductor components are the basic ingredient in today s electronic devices 
in contrast to the binary nature of digital components  analog components monitor  evaluate and modify electrical signals and strengths allowing them to deal with basic and essential properties such as heat  touch  light and sound 
the high performance analog and mixed signal segment is distinguished by its highly differentiated and technologically advanced products which can be building blocks for more complex circuits or highly integrated for specific applications 
historically  the high performance analog and mixed signal segment has yielded higher gross margins and suffers less competition than the digital and broader analog segments of the semiconductor market 
the high performance analog and mixed signal segment requires uniquely talented and experienced designers  engineers and specialized selling and marketing efforts to address the myriad of challenges associated with today s complex applications 

table of contents we began our transformation into a high performance analog and mixed signal company with the acquisition of elantec in and the divestiture of our wireless networking business in we further strengthened the transformation with the acquisition of xicor 
our transformation has required us to report our financial performance with restructurings  impairments  discontinued operations and write offs attendant to our acquisitions 
our first full year as a pure high performance analog and mixed signal company was since then  our focus has resulted in revenue growth that has been very broad based across our many analog and mixed signal products 
we have introduced hundreds of new products in each of the last few years including several new product families that have significantly expanded our served available market 
in april  we completed the acquisition of techwell  bringing unique capabilities which complement our industrial video businesses and making industrial our largest end market 
our investments to expand our product portfolio to over product families appear to be successful  which will enable us to reach our primary management goals of revenue growth with higher margins  growing operating income and increasing cash flow generation measured against the investment in the company 
we utilize a week fiscal year  ending on the nearest friday to december the next week period will be in all years presented are fiscal years and contain weeks

geographical revenue in millions revenue of revenue revenue of revenue revenue of revenue asia pacific north america europe and other total 
table of contents revenue and cost of revenue revenue our revenue for was million  a decrease of million or from the revenue decrease was driven primarily by decreased revenue in all end markets due to broad based declines in all markets 
sales into the industrial market decreased from levels  while each of the communication and consumer markets decreased approximately 
computing experienced lower declines of from  primarily due to strength in the notebook market 
our revenue for was million  an increase of million or from the revenue increase was driven primarily by increased revenue in the industrial end market  due to the acquisition of techwell  which broadened our industrial portfolio  as well as our focus on growing more stable and higher margin industrial business 
we further increased revenue in the communications and high end consumer markets as revenues were increasing to levels  prior to the sudden down turn in the economy in late revenue by end market in millions revenue of revenue revenue of revenue revenue of revenue industrial computing consumer communications total in aggregate  lower overall unit demand in decreased revenues by approximately million from levels and a decrease in asps decreased revenues from levels by approximately million 
of this net revenue decrease  approximately million came from our sales to customers in north america  approximately million came from sales to customers in the asia pacific region and approximately million came from sales to customers in europe and other countries 
in aggregate  higher unit demand in increased revenues by approximately million from levels and an increase in asps increased revenues from levels by approximately million 
of this net revenue increase  approximately million came from our sales to customers in the asia pacific region and million came from sales to customers in north america with europe and other countries increasing approximately million 
we anticipate that our revenue from customers in the asia pacific region will continue to grow as that region leads in the manufacture of the finished goods consumer electronics  computers  communications equipment in which our products are used 
end market demand for those products is global  and therefore  dependent on aggregate global economic metrics and conditions such as personal incomes and business activity and not necessarily on asian and pacific rim regional economic factors 
see business outlook elsewhere in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations relating to expected revenues in the near term 
cost of revenue cost of revenues consists primarily of purchased materials and services  labor  overhead and depreciation associated with manufacturing pertaining to products sold 
our gross margin decreased by basis points in from the decrease was primarily due to product sales mix changes at the product family level along with lower utilization as sales decreased 
generally  our computing and consumer products have lower gross margins than our industrial and communications products 
we strive to improve gross margins from their present levels by introducing new high margin products and cost saving opportunities in our manufacturing chain 

table of contents our gross margin increased by basis points in from the increase was primarily due to changes in the mix of product sold  our increased focus on highly differentiated products and manufacturing cost reductions 
generally  our computing and consumer products have lower gross margins than our industrial and communications products 
in  the acquisition of techwell and our focus on higher margin products resulted in substantially increased revenues from the industrial end market  overall and as a percentage of total revenue 
operating expenses research and development r d r d expenses consist primarily of salaries and expenses of employees engaged in product process research  design and development activities  as well as related subcontracting activities  prototype development  cost of design tools and technology license agreement expenses 
our r d expenses increased by or million to million in compared to million for while we continue to invest in r d to persue future growth  we implemented cost saving initiatives in the third and fourth quarters of to optimize and integrate acquired organizations and to maintain r d spending at approximately levels 
we realigned our resources to focus on our primary future growth drivers while continuing to invest in products aimed at the broad industrial market 
our r d expenses increased by or million to million in compared to million for we grew our r d spending primarily through additional employees gained in acquisitions in order to invest in future products and technology essential for long term growth 
selling  general and administrative sg a sg a expenses consist primarily of salaries and expenses of employees engaged in selling and marketing our products as well as the salaries and expenses required to perform our human resources  finance  information systems  legal  executive and other administrative functions 
our sg a expenses increased by or million to million for compared to million for the increase in was primarily due to higher labor costs and supplies from additional employees gained in acquisitions during and increased sales and incentives during the first quarter of our sg a expenses increased by or million to million for compared to million for the increase in was primarily driven by increased sales commissions  compensation expense and increased incentives as sales increased 
amortization of purchased intangibles amortization of purchased intangibles was million in  million in and million in the decrease in was primarily due to intangibles that became fully amortized during the increase in was primarily due to purchased intangibles from the acquisition of techwell in the second quarter of our purchased intangibles  which are definite lived assets  are amortized over their useful lives ranging from to years 
restructuring restructuring costs were million in  minimal in and million in the restructuring was part of our ongoing efforts to optimize operations and conclude the integrations of acquired organizations 
it included workforce reductions of approximately and an anticipated reduction in annual operating expenses of approximately million 
restructuring expenses in related to our fab consolidation efforts announced in acquisition related costs acquisition related costs were million in  million in and million in acquisition related costs in and were primarily due to the acquisition of techwell in the second quarter of acquisition related costs in were primarily related to the quellan acquisition in the third quarter of 
table of contents other income and expenses interest income our interest income decreased to million in compared to million in and million in interest income decreased in and due to decreased average cash and investment balances and continued low interest rates 
interest expense and fees our interest expense and fees increased to million in from million in and million in the increase was due to interest and fees on the long term debt agreement entered into during to facilitate the acquisition of techwell 
loss on extinguishment of debt during the year ended december   we extinguished our previous term loan agreement and wrote off million in unamortized loan fees 
loss gain on deferred compensation investments we have a liability for a non qualified deferred compensation plan 
we maintain a portfolio of approximately million in mutual fund investments and corporate owned life insurance under the plan 
changes in the fair value of the asset are recorded as a loss gain on deferred compensation investments and changes in the fair value of the liability are recorded as a component of compensation expense 
in general  the compensation benefit expense is substantially offset by the gains and losses on the investment 
during  we recorded a loss on deferred compensation investments of million and a decrease in compensation expense of million 
during  we recorded a gain on deferred compensation investments of million and an increase in compensation expense of million 
loss on sale of investments during  we sold our entire remaining portfolio of auction rate securities ars for a net loss of million  before taxes 
during  we recorded a million loss on the sale of certain investments  before taxes 
there were no losses on the sale of investments in other than temporary impairment losses during and  we recorded impairment charges of million and million  respectively  before taxes  on certain ars whose decline in fair value was determined to be other than temporary 
the impairments were recorded due to credit rating downgrades on specific investments in the ars portfolio 
we did not record any other than temporary impairments in income tax benefit expense our income tax benefit was million for compared to tax expense of million for income tax for included a benefit of million related to the re measurement of our unrecognized tax benefits utbs 
we re measured certain of our utbs as we approach closure on our irs audit for tax years through which is currently in the appeals process and as we progress through the audit for tax years and which is currently under examination 
also as a result of our progress in appeals  we included a benefit of million related to incremental prior year federal and state r d credits net of a valuation allowance on the state portion of these credits 
income tax expense for included a million charge due primarily to a provision established upon the completion of fieldwork on a multi year irs examination  offset by a tax benefit of million resulting from the donation of a portion of our facilities in palm bay 
our income tax expense was million for compared to tax expense of million for income tax expense for included a million charge due primarily to a provision established upon the completion of fieldwork on a multi year irs examination  offset by a tax benefit of million resulting from the donation of a portion of our facilities in palm bay 
income tax expense for included a million benefit related to a reversal of the valuation allowance associated with previously recorded impairments on ars  partially offset by a million charge related to the move of our international headquarters 

table of contents in determining net income  we estimate and exercise judgment in the calculation of tax expense and tax liabilities  and in assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of assets and liabilities 
in the ordinary course of business  the ultimate tax outcome of many transactions and calculations is uncertain  as the calculation of tax liabilities involves the application of complex tax laws in the united states and other jurisdictions 
we recognize liabilities for additional taxes that may be due on tax audit issues based on an estimate of the ultimate resolution of those issues 
although we believe the estimates are reasonable  the final outcome may be different than amounts we estimate 
such determinations could have a material impact on the income tax provision  effective tax rate and operating results in the period they occur 
in addition  the effective tax rate reflected in our forward looking statements is based on current enacted tax law 
significant changes in enacted tax law could materially impact our estimates 
backlog our sales are made pursuant to purchase orders that are generally booked up to six months in advance of delivery 
our standard terms and conditions of sale provide that these orders may not be cancelled or rescheduled thirty days prior to the most current crd for standard products and ninety days prior to the customer request date for semi custom and custom products 
backlog is influenced by several factors  including end market demand  pricing and customer order patterns in reaction to product lead times 
additionally  we believe backlog can fall faster than consumption rates in periods of weak end market demand since production lead times can be shorter 
conversely  we believe backlog can grow faster than consumption in periods of strong end market demand as production and delivery times increase and some customers may increase orders in excess of their current consumption to reduce their own risk of production disruptions 
our six month backlog was million as of december  compared to million as of december  and million as of january  although not always the case  we believe backlog can be an indicator of performance in the near future 
business outlook when we announced via our fourth quarter earnings press release filed with our current report on form k on february   we anticipated revenues for the first quarter of to be in the range of to million 
based on this outlook  we expected first quarter earnings loss per diluted share between and impact of inflation and changing prices the semiconductor industry has  for several decades  experienced a phenomenon of continual decline in sales prices per unit 
this phenomenon brings unique challenges to managing our business 
in order to increase revenues  we must continually introduce new products that support higher sales prices or increase the units of product sold 
this leads to capacity and production management issues and requires a large investment in research and development to regularly introduce new products that are differentiated based on qualities other than price and enable us to increase our average unit selling prices 
at the same time we are faced with many fixed costs in our business that increase at the same rate of general inflation in the economy and must be managed carefully and aggressively in order to maintain operating margins 
these characteristics of revenue pressure from selling price  the need to invest heavily in research and development and inflation prone fixed costs means that earning a reasonable return for our shareholders is challenging 

table of contents contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements contractual obligations the following table sets forth our future contractual obligations as of december  in millions thereafter total future minimum lease commitments open capital asset purchase commitments open raw material purchase commitments interest rate swap agreement principal and interest on long term debt tax liability arising from utbs other purchase commitments total our future minimum lease commitments consist primarily of leases for buildings and other real property 
open capital asset purchase commitments primarily include leasehold improvement  test and production equipment 
open raw material purchase commitments represents minimum purchase requirements as part of a guaranteed capacity agreement with one of our wafer suppliers and purchase orders for million for externally produced wafers 
long term debt includes principal and expected interest payments on our million revolving credit facility maturing in see note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
our interest rate swap agreement includes our expected net payments see note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the utbs relate primarily to a provision established at the completion of field work on an irs tax audit for tax years through off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
liquidity and capital resources our capital requirements depend on a variety of factors  including but not limited to  the rate of increase or decrease in our existing business base  the success  timing and amount of investment required to bring new products to market  revenue growth or decline  and potential acquisitions 
we believe that we have the financial resources necessary to meet business requirements for the next months  including our dividend program  the requisite capital expenditures for the maintenance of worldwide manufacturing capacity  working capital requirements and potential future acquisitions or strategic investments 
as of december   our total shareholders equity was  million and we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
we had million in short term investments and million in long term investments  both primarily bank time deposits  as of december  in addition  as of december   we had million in long term debt outstanding see note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as of december   approximately million of our cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments was held by our foreign subsidiaries 
this amount would be subject to federal and state taxation at approximately upon repatriation 
we currently do not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate these funds 
as of december   all of our short and long term investments were held by our foreign subsidiaries and were all denominated in us dollars 
on september   we established a new five year  million revolving credit facility the facility 
this facility replaced our previous million term loan facility and million revolving credit facility 
as of december   the outstanding principal balance on the facility was million  resulting in million of borrowing capacity 
the facility matures on september  and is payable in full upon maturity 
under the facility  million is available for the issuance of standby letters of credit  million is available as swing line loans and million is available for multicurrency borrowings 
amounts repaid under the facility may be reborrowed 
the facility currently bears interest at over one month libor but is variable based on our leverage ratio as described in the credit agreement in exhibit as of december   we were in compliance with all applicable covenants of the credit agreement 

table of contents we expect existing domestic cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities  such as regular quarterly dividends  debt repayment schedules  and material capital expenditures  for at least the next months and thereafter for the foreseeable future 
in addition  we expect existing foreign cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities  such as material capital expenditures  for at least the next months and thereafter for the foreseeable future 
our primary sources and uses of cash during the three years ended december  are presented in this summarized table in millions year ended december  december  january  sources of cash existing business performance and activities operating activities  including working capital changes exercise of stock options and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan issuance of long term debt proceeds of long term debt  net of fees uses of cash business improvement investments business acquisitions  net capital expenditures  net of sale proceeds repayments of debt repayments of debt returned to shareholders dividends paid cash investment management activities decrease in investments and foreign exchange effects net increase in cash and cash equivalents in  our operational cash flows were million compared to million in  a decrease of million  due primarily to the decrease in sales  offset by reductions in accounts receivables and changes in other operating assets and liabilities 
we received million from the issuance of long term debt  net of fees 
we used approximately million for capital expenditures 
we repaid million of debt and we returned million to shareholders in the form of dividends 
investment balances were decreased by million in  resulting in net cash provided of million overall 
investment balances decreased as we sold our portfolio of ars  offset by purchases of bank time deposits 
we strive to continually improve the cash flows from our existing business activities and return a substantial portion of that cash flow to shareholders 
we continue to maintain and improve our existing business performance with necessary capital expenditures and acquisitions that may further improve our business and return on investment 
cash  stock  debt or a combination thereof may be issued to fund additional acquisitions to grow our business 
our cash  cash equivalents and investments give us the flexibility to return free cash flow to our shareholders in the form of dividends  while also pursuing business improvement opportunities for our future 
non cash working capital trade accounts receivable  less valuation allowances  decreased by million  or  to million as of december  from million as of december  this decrease primarily reflects the decrease in sales 
our net inventories decreased by million  or  to million as of december  from million as of december  inventories decreased from as a result of decreased sales activity and greater utilization of inventory on hand 
we maintain stock of certain high volume products to ensure our lead times remain within customer expectations 

table of contents capital expenditures capital expenditures  net of sales proceeds  were million for  million for  and million for capital expenditures have been focused primarily on the expansion of test capacity to support continuing unit volume growth  electronic equipment mostly for r d  and it related equipment 
we anticipate capital expenditures will remain at current levels in the near term 
proceeds from exercises of stock options options and our employee stock purchase plan espp cash flow from stock plans including exercises of options and sales under our espp was million in  compared to million received in and million received in we have changed the mix of new share based incentive grants to a larger proportion of restricted and deferred stock units awards than options 
awards do not yield cash proceeds from an exercise event as do options 
additionally  exercises are decisions of grantees and are influenced by the level of our stock price and by other considerations of grantees 
the recent decline in stock price has resulted in many of our options being underwater with exercise prices in excess of the current stock price 
while the level of cash inflow from exercises is difficult to forecast or control  we believe it will remain a secondary source of cash 
dividends on common stock in october  our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of per share of common stock 
the dividend was paid on november  to shareholders of record as of the close of business on november  in february  our board of directors also declared a dividend of per share  to be paid on february  to shareholders of record as of the close of business on february  transactions with related and certain other parties none 
critical accounting policies and estimates we consider the following seven accounting estimation processes to be critical to the preparation of our financial statements the allowance for collection losses on trade receivables  distributor  oem and warranty allowances  allowances for excess or obsolete inventory  the assessment of recoverability of goodwill  accounting for income taxes  fair value of equity based compensation  and fair value of investments 
these estimates involve estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective and require certain assumptions that  if incorrect  could create changes  including adverse ones  to our statement of operations and financial position 
allowance for collection losses on trade receivables  or receivables allowance in millions december  december  gross trade receivables receivables allowance other allowances net trade receivables 
table of contents our receivables allowance is used to state trade receivables at a net realizable value or the amount that we estimate will be collected on our gross receivables 
since the amount that we will actually collect on the receivables outstanding cannot be known until the future  we rely primarily on prior experience 
our historical collection losses have been typically infrequent with write offs of trade receivables being well below of sales 
in order to allow for future collection losses that arise from customer accounts that do not currently indicate the inability to pay but could have such an inability in the future  we maintain an allowance based on a month rolling average of write offs  which as of december  was less than of our gross trade receivables balance 
we also maintain specific allowances for customer accounts that we know may not be collectible for various reasons  such as bankruptcy and other customer liquidity issues 
we analyze our trade receivable portfolio based on the age of each customer s invoice 
in this way  we can identify the accounts that are more likely to have collection problems 
we then provide an allowance for a portion or all of the customer s balance based on our evaluation of the ultimate collectability of the account 
distributor  oem and warranty allowances  or other allowances allowances for various customer credits are shown in the table above as other allowances 
this is a combination of distributor  oem and warranty allowances 
sales to international distributors are made under agreements which provide the distributors certain price protection on a percentage of unsold inventories they hold 
accordingly  distributor allowances are estimates of the amount of price adjustments that will be encountered in the future on inventory held by international distributors as of the balance sheet date 
we rely primarily on historical international distributor transactions to estimate these adjustments 
the international distributor allowances are comprised of two components that are reasonably estimable 
the first component is the price protection allowance  which protects the distributors gross margins in the event of falling prices which are common in semiconductors and other electronic components 
this allowance is based on the relationship of historical credits issued to distributors in relation to historical inventory levels and the price paid by the distributor as applied to current inventory levels 
the second component is a stock rotation allowance  which is based on the percentage of sales made to limited international distributors whereby the distributors can periodically receive a credit for unsold inventory they hold 
distributor allowances were million as of december  and million as of december  in  we entered into price protection agreements with additional international distributors to solidify our relationship and stabilize prices across geographic regions 
allowances for our oem customers totaled million as of december  warranty allowances  returns for which there are product performance claims  totaled million as of december  allowances for excess or obsolete inventory  or inventory allowances we record our inventories at the lower of cost or market as described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as the ultimate market value that we will realize through sales on our inventory cannot be known with exact certainty  we rely on past sales experience and future sales forecasts to project it 
in analyzing our inventory levels  we classify certain inventory as either excess or obsolete 
these classifications are maintained for all classes of inventory  although raw materials are seldom deemed excess or obsolete 
we classify inventory as obsolete if we have withdrawn it from the marketplace or if we have had no sales of the product for the past months and no sales forecasted for the next months 
we provide an allowance for of the standard cost of obsolete inventory 
it is our policy to scrap obsolete inventory 
we conduct reviews of excess inventory on a quarterly basis and reserve a significant portion of the standard cost of excess inventory 
we classify inventory as excess if we have quantities of product greater than the amounts we have sold in the past months or have forecasted to sell in the next months 
we typically retain excess inventory until the inventory is sold or reclassified as obsolete 
for all items identified as excess or obsolete  management reviews the individual facts and circumstances  ie competitive landscape  industry economic conditions  product lifecycles and product cannibalization  specific to that inventory 
inventory allowances totaled approximately million on gross inventory of million as of december  and million on gross inventory of million as of december  product demand estimates are a key element in determining inventory allowances 
our estimate of product demand requires significant judgment and is based in part on historical revenue 
historical sales may not accurately predict future demand 
if future demand is ultimately lower than our estimate  we could incur significant additional expenses to provide allowances for and scrap obsolete inventory 

table of contents assessment of recoverability of goodwill we perform an annual assessment of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year  or more frequently if indications of potential impairment exist 
see note goodwill is tested under a two step method for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as a reporting unit 
step one is to identify potential impairment 
we compare the calculated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  no impairment of the goodwill of the reporting unit is indicated and step two is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test will be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the amount of impairment loss is the excess of carrying amount of goodwill over the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
after a goodwill impairment loss is recognized  the adjusted carrying amount of goodwill will be the new accounting basis 
significant judgment is involved in the determination of fair value for the above analysis 
our estimates of fair value are based on a combination of the income approach  which estimates the fair value of our reporting units based on the future discounted cash flows  and the market approach  which estimates the fair value of our reporting units based on comparable market prices 
the use of future discounted cash flows is based on assumptions that are consistent with our estimates of future growth and the strategic plan used to manage the underlying business 
factors requiring significant judgment include assumptions related to future growth rates  discount factors  market multiples and tax rates  amongst other considerations 
changes in economic and operating conditions that occur after the annual impairment analysis or an interim impairment analysis  and that impact these assumptions  may result in a future goodwill impairment charge 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required to determine worldwide income tax liabilities 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
our effective tax rate and the actual taxes ultimately payable could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings between countries with differing statutory tax rates  in the valuation of deferred tax assets  in tax laws or by material audit assessments  which could affect our profitability 
temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  establish a valuation allowance 
as of december   our net deferred tax asset amounted to million compared to million as of december  as of december   our net valuation allowance was million compared to million as of december  applicable guidance requires us to record our tax expense based on various estimates of probabilities of sustaining certain tax positions 
as a result of this and other factors  our tax expense could be volatile  which contributes to volatility in reported financial results 
as of december  and december   our utbs related to uncertain tax positions were and  respectively 
fair value of equity based compensation we generally calculate the fair value of an equity based compensation grant compensation cost on the date of grant using a lattice method or  for market based grants  a monte carlo simulation 
the compensation cost is then amortized straight line over the shorter of vesting life or requisite service period 
calculating fair value requires us to estimate certain key assumptions in the valuation model  including expected stock price volatility  the risk free interest rate in the market  the expected life of the option granted and annualized dividend yield 
volatility is one of the most significant determinants of fair value 
we estimate our volatility using a blend of estimated price movement activity implied by our traded options and the actual historic volatility of our stock price 
we estimate our expected risk free interest rate by using the zero coupon us treasury rate at the time of the grant related to the expected life of the grant 
expected forfeitures must be estimated to offset the compensation cost expected to be recorded in the financial statements 
we estimate forfeitures for the first year of vesting  based on historical information about turnover for each appropriate employee level 
thereafter  as vesting tiers within an option are more frequent until fully vested  forfeitures are no longer estimated but rather recorded as they actually occur 
we estimate the annualized dividend yield by dividing the current annualized dividend by the closing stock price on the date of grant 

table of contents calculating fair value for our options and awards that have a performance measurement element to them also requires us to estimate the likely actual performance before the performance is complete 
we do this by adjusting the forfeiture rate to include the expectation of actual performance at the time the calculation is made for purposes of amortizing the compensation appropriately 
such performance based instruments  depending upon the term of required performance  may need to be re measured as frequently as quarterly 
see note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information with regard to our performance based grants 
we base these estimates of key assumptions on historical information using judgment regarding future expectations 
we re examine our assumptions on a regular basis 
when such examinations of the key assumptions lead to significant changes to the calculation inputs  it can have a material effect on the amount of equity based compensation that will be recognized in aggregate or in any period 
this may mean more volatility in our reported earnings due to changes in facts and circumstances surrounding our use of equity compensation 
fair value of investments available for sale afs and traded securities are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet 
for actively traded securities  we generally rely upon the valuations as provided by the custodian of these assets 
for afs securities  we use the present value of expected future cash flows to determine fair value 
significant judgments are required in the estimation of fair value  including assumptions about the expected holding period  yield  and appropriate discount rates 
we then evaluate each security to determine whether any impairment is temporary or other than temporary 
temporary impairments are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss oci  while other than temporary impairments are recorded as a component of non operating income 
recent accounting pronouncements fasb accounting standards update asu  fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements in january  the fasb issued guidance to improve the disclosures for level  level and level fair value measurements 
asu requires new disclosures for significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements  and requires entities to separately report information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements of level fair value measurements 
asu also updates asc  fair value measurements and disclosures  to require an entity to provide fair value measurement disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities 
entities should also provide disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements for level and level fair value measurements 
asu is currently effective 
this statement resulted in additional disclosures on fair value measurements 
fasb asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other asc topic 
asu modifies step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
for those reporting units  an entity is required to perform step of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
in determining whether it is more likely than not that an impairment of goodwill exists  an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist 
this statement is currently effective and did not impact our unaudited consolidated financial statements 
fasb asu  fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss in april  the fasb issued asu asu no 
provides a uniform framework for fair value measurements and related disclosures between us gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs 
additional disclosure requirements in the update include for level fair value measurements  quantitative information about unobservable inputs used  a description of the valuation processes used by the entity  and a qualitative discussion about the sensitivity of the measurements to changes in the unobservable inputs  for an entity s use of a nonfinancial asset that is different from the asset s highest and best use  the reason for the difference  for financial instruments not measured at fair value but for which disclosure of fair value is required  the fair value hierarchy level in which the fair value measurements were determined  and the disclosure of all transfers between level and level of the fair value hierarchy 
asu will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after december  we anticipate asu will result in additional disclosures within our financial statements 

table of contents fasb asu  comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income in june  the fasb issued asu asu no 
amends existing guidance by allowing only two options for presenting the components of net income and oci in a single continuous financial statement  statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive financial statements  consisting of an income statement followed by a separate statement of oci 
also  items that are reclassified from oci to net income must be presented on the face of the financial statements 
asu no 
requires retrospective application  and it is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
we do not expect asu to have a material impact on our financial statements 
fasb asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment in september  the fasb issued asu asu no 
amends existing guidance by permitting an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test described in topic under the amendments in this asu  an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
asu will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after december  with early adoption permitted 
we do not anticipate asu will have a material impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk global economic conditions pose a risk to the overall economy as consumers and businesses may defer purchases in response to the uncertainty around tighter credit and negative financial news 
these conditions could reduce product demand and affect other related matters 
demand could be different from our expectations due to many factors including changes in business and economic conditions  conditions in the credit market that could affect consumer confidence  customer acceptance of our products  changes in customer order patterns including order cancellations and changes in the level of inventory held by vendors 
credit markets have tightened as a result of the financial crises in recent years  resulting in lower liquidity in many financial markets and excess volatility in fixed income  credit and equity markets 
we could experience a number of resulting effects  including product delays due to effects experienced by key suppliers  reduced orders and payments as customers are affected by tighter credit markets and or insolvency  decreased investing and financing options in a tighter market  increased expenses  increased impairments resulting from lower orders and sales as customers experience difficulties obtaining financing  and volatility and extreme changes in the earnings and fair value of our investments 
moreover  in the normal course of doing business  we are exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
we employ established policies and procedures governing the use of financial instruments  entered into for purposes other than trading purposes  to manage our exposure to these risks 
our cash equivalents and investments are subject to three market risks interest rate risk  credit risk and liquidity risk 
our investments as of december  are primarily held in bank time deposits 
prior to the year ending december   we held a substantial portfolio of illiquid ars 
during and  we recorded million and million of impairments of ars  respectively 
as of december   we had recorded an additional million unrealized loss against oci and a related tax benefit of million  for a net unrealized loss of million in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
in the fourth quarter of  we sold our entire portfolio of ars which resulted in a loss in earnings of million  million of which was previously recorded in oci 
see notes and in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional quantitative and qualitative details 
as of december   we had open foreign exchange contracts to economically hedge forecasted foreign cash flow commitments up to six months 
as our hedges on forecasted foreign cash flow commitments do not qualify for hedge accounting  gains and losses on changes in the fair market value of the foreign exchange contracts are recognized in income 
realized and unrealized gains and losses from economic hedges are classified in the statements of operations consistent with the accounting classification of the items being economically hedged 
the derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value 
we believe our cash flow hedges have been economically effective 

table of contents the table below summarizes our foreign exchange contract activity over the past two years in millions year ended december  december  realized loss on foreign exchange contracts unrealized gain loss on foreign exchange contracts purchases and sales of foreign exchange contracts notional amount of open contracts as of year end fair value of open contracts as of year end in the second quarter of  we entered into certain interest rate swap contracts which we designated as cash flow hedges 
these contracts had a notional value of million to hedge a portion of the risk of changes in three month libor related to our then outstanding million term loan 
in the third quarter of  we terminated these contracts 
up until the time we terminated the contracts  we recognized a loss of million  net of tax  in oci 
this loss will be reclassified through earnings over a period commensurate with the original required cash flow and will be fully reclassified by the fourth quarter of in the third quarter of  after converting our term loan to a million revolving credit facility  we entered into certain interest rate swap contracts with a notional value of million to hedge a portion of the risk of changes in one month libor 
under the terms of the interest rate swaps  we will effectively convert million of our variable rate term loan to fixed interest rates through august  we designated these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges to hedge the risk of changes in the benchmark interest rate 
the fair value of the swaps at inception were zero and subsequent changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are recorded in oci  net of tax benefit  to the extent they are effective in offsetting the variability of the hedged cash flows 
we hedge against both currency exchange and interest rate risk 
our hedging activities provide only limited protection against currency exchange risks 
factors that could impact the effectiveness of our currency exchange hedging programs include accuracy of sales estimates  volatility of currency markets and the cost and availability of hedging instruments 
a adverse change in currency exchange rates for our foreign currency derivatives held as of december  will have a negligible impact on the fair values of these instruments 
this qualification of exposure to the market risk associated with foreign exchange financial instruments does not take into account the offsetting impact of changes in the fair values of foreign denominated assets  liabilities and firm commitments 
the interest rate swap contracts serve to effectively convert a portion of our debt from variable rate to fixed rate 
though the swap contracts were perfectly effective at the time we entered into them  any ineffectiveness in future periods caused by inconsistent cash flows on the debt and the swap contracts could impact earnings 
a adverse change in current interest rates for the swap derivatives held as of december  would have a negligible impact on the fair value of these instruments 
see note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
a substantial majority of our revenues and liabilities outside the us are billed  collected  and paid in us dollars 
therefore  we do not believe we have material risk to currency rates
