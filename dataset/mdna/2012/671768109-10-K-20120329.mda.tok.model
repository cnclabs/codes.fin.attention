executive overview executive summary in  with the continuing impact of a sluggish economy  management has continued to focus on managing credit quality  building liquidity sources  managing capital  and improving operational earnings of the company 
as always  we continue our on going efforts of meeting the financial services needs of our customers and communities  especially in this challenging economic environment 
managing credit quality senior management continues to work closely with credit administration and our lending staff to insure that adequate resources are in place to proactively manage through the current slowdown in the real estate markets and overall economy 
when problems are identified  management remains diligent in assessing the situation  moving quickly to minimize losses  while being sensitive to the borrower s effectiveness as an operator  the long term viability of the business or project  and the borrower s commitment to working with the bank to achieve an acceptable resolution of the credit 
as the economic slowdown has continued  we have experienced a rise in non performing assets  and we address each situation on a case by case basis 
when faced with possible loss situations  management may determine it is in the shareholders best long term interest to work with the borrower or oversee a viable project through to completion 
we anticipate that a prolonged economic slowdown will place significant pressure on the consumers and businesses in north carolina 
we have attempted to proactively address the needs of the bank  our borrowers  and the community through our community loan investment program  which has been in place since february  and offers incentives to buyers of our builder s homes financed by the bank 
through our community loan investment program  which is being utilized by the majority of our builders  as of december  we have been able to move out of jumbo homes and out of conventional homes out of our builder construction portfolio either to permanent mortgages placed with other lenders or permanent mortgages financed by the bank to qualified borrowers 
the program has resulted in the reduction of our exposure to jumbo homes from million to million  and the reduction of our exposure to conventional homes from million to thousand 
this program can be accessed through our website at www

building liquidity sources management has continued to focus on providing additional liquidity sources  both on balance sheet and off 
during the year ended december   we had a significant shift in our deposit mix as noninterest bearing and interest bearing checking accounts increased million and million  respectively  from year end to year end  driven by what we believe was a move away from large financial institutions to smaller community banks like ours 
managing capital the company was able to bolster its capital levels through its million participation in the cpp on january  of the total million cpp funds received  to date million of the cpp funds have been contributed to the bank as additional equity capital 
approximately million in unused capital  which includes approximately thousand in earnings since the company received the cpp funds  are retained by the company but could be pushed down to the bank if needed 
with total risk based capital levels at the bank of at december   the bank is well above the minimum requirement to be classified as well capitalized 
if the remaining million of available capital at the company were contributed to the bank as additional equity capital  the bank s total risk based capital ratio would be at december  and would place it well above the minimum well capitalized requirement of 
despite healthy capital levels  due to significant uncertainty surrounding the depth and the length of the current economic slowdown  management continues to be diligent in its efforts to maintain healthy levels of excess capital above minimum requirements 
although the company continues to actively explore capital alternatives  management has concluded that at the current time it is not feasible  due to weak equity market conditions  or preferable  due to the potential dilution of current shareholders  to raise equity in the open markets 
however  the company established an employee stock ownership plan esop in the second quarter of as one possible vehicle to generate equity 
during the year ended december   the company  at the request of the board of directors  made a  pre tax esop accrual that may be converted to common equity of the company at a later date 
the company believes that there are many advantages to an esop as a vehicle to raise capital  with the principal ones being favorable tax treatment of esop contributions  possible lower dilution to existing shareholders compared to an equity offering  and the promotion in the bank s marketplace of every employee as a participant in the esop owning a part of the company 
improving operational earnings our core strategies continue to be grow the loan portfolio while maintaining high asset quality  increase noninterest income  grow core deposits  manage expenses  and make strategic investments in personnel and technology to increase revenue and increase efficiency 
challenges the company has grown steadily since the opening of the bank in april of  and its business has become more dynamic and complex in recent years as the bank has enhanced or added delivery channels  products and services  and lines of businesses 
while the achievement of the company s strategic initiatives and established long term financial goals is subject to many uncertainties and challenges  management has identified the challenges that are most relevant and most likely to have a near term effect on operations  which are presented below continuing to maintain our asset quality  especially in an uncertain and weak economic environment  addressing the challenges associated with a weak economic environment in its geographic market  improving efficiency and controlling noninterest expenses  maintaining its net interest margin in the current interest rate environment  increasing core deposits  increasing interest and noninterest revenue  controlling costs associated with the current heightened regulatory environment  volatility in the mortgage banking business  competition from bank and nonbank financial service providers  and intense price competition 
comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and net income in  our loss available to common stockholders was thousand or basic and diluted earnings per share  compared to income available to common stockholders of thousand or basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december  the decrease in net income is attributable to increases in provisions for loan losses and noninterest expense and decreases in noninterest income  offset by a decrease in noninterest expense and income tax expense 
the following table shows return on assets net income divided by average assets  return on equity net income divided by average shareholders equity and shareholders equity to assets ratio average shareholders equity divided by average total assets for each of the years presented 
year ended december  return on assets return loss on equity shareholders equity to assets net interest income net interest income the difference between the interest earned on assets  such as loans and investment securities and the interest paid on liabilities  such as deposits and other borrowings is our primary source of operating income 
the level of net interest income is determined primarily by the average balances volume of interest earning assets and our interest bearing liabilities and the various rate spreads between our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
changes in net interest income from period to period result from increases or decreases in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  increases or decreases in the average interest rates earned and paid on such assets and liabilities  the ability to manage the interest earning asset portfolio  and the availability of particular sources of funds  such as non interest bearing deposits 
the banking industry uses two key ratios to measure profitability of net interest income net interest rate spread and net interest margin 
the net interest rate spread measures the difference between the average yield on earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest rate spread does not consider the impact of non interest bearing deposits and gives a direct perspective on the effect of market interest rate movements 
the net interest margin is defined as net interest income as a percentage of total average earning assets and takes into account the positive effects of investing non interest bearing deposits in earning assets 
our net interest income for the year ended december  was million  an increase of thousand or when compared to net interest income of million for the year ended december  our net interest margin for was compared to for the increase in our net interest margin is mainly the result of decreased rates paid on our interest bearing liabilities  offset by a decline in yields on interest earning assets

the yield on average earning assets decreased basis points during compared to the effect of variances in volume and rate on interest income and interest expense is illustrated in the table titled change in interest income and expense on page of this annual report on form k 
we attribute the majority of the decrease in the yield on our earning assets to a decline in the yield on our taxable investment securities portfolio  which was due to a decline in yields on new investment purchases during the year 
to a lesser extent  some of the decline in the total yield on interest earning assets was caused by new and renewing fixed rate loans originated in a lower interest rate environment

the following table sets forth our interest sensitivity analysis at december  and describes  at various cumulative maturity intervals  the gap ratios ratios of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities for assets and liabilities that we consider to be rate sensitive 
the interest sensitivity position has meaning only as of the date for which it was prepared 
variable rate loans are considered to be highly sensitive to rate changes and are assumed to reprice within months 
the difference between interest sensitive asset and interest sensitive liability repricing within time periods is referred to as the interest rate sensitivity gap 
gaps are identified as either positive interest sensitive assets in excess of interest sensitive liabilities or negative interest sensitive liabilities in excess of interest sensitive assets 
as of december   we had a negative one year cumulative gap of 
we have interest earning assets of million maturing or repricing within one year and interest bearing liabilities of million repricing or maturing within one year 
this is primarily the result of short term interest sensitive liabilities being used to fund longer term interest earning assets  such as loans and investment securities 
a negative gap position implies that interest bearing liabilities deposits and other borrowings will reprice at a faster rate than interest earning assets loans and investments 
in a falling rate environment  a negative gap position will generally have a positive effect on earnings  while in a rising rate environment this will generally have a negative effect on earnings 
on december   savings  now and money market accounts totaled million 
in our rate sensitivity analysis  these deposits are considered as repricing in the earliest period months or less because the rate we pay on these interest bearing deposits can be changed weekly 
however  our historical experience has shown that changes in market interest rates have little  if any  effect on those deposits within a given time period and  for that reason  those liabilities could be considered non rate sensitive 
if those deposits were excluded from rate sensitive liabilities  our rate sensitive assets and liabilities would be more closely matched at the end of the one year period

income simulation analysis captures not only the potential of all assets and liabilities to mature or reprice  but also the probability that they will do so 
income simulation also attends to the relative interest rate sensitivities of these items  and projects their behavior over an extended period of time 
finally  income simulation permits management to assess the probable effects on the balance sheet not only of changes in interest rates  but also of proposed strategies for responding to them 
the company s income simulation model was developed by profitstar  a financial services consulting firm that provides asset liability management solutions  product pricing solutions and other products and services to banks  thrifts  and credit unions nationwide 
the model analyzes interest rate sensitivity by projecting net interest income and net income over the next months in a flat rate scenario versus net interest income and net income in alternative interest rate scenarios 
management continually reviews and refines its interest rate risk management process in response to the changing economic climate 
the company s alco asset liability committee policy has established that interest income sensitivity will be considered acceptable if net interest income does not decline from the flat rate scenario more than    and in the plus and minus   and basis point scenarios  respectively 
these interest rate scenarios assume that rates increase immediately and permanently 
at december   the company s income simulation model projects that net interest income would increase   and in the plus   and basis point change scenarios 
all of these forecasts are within an acceptable level of interest rate risk per the policies established by alco 
alco did not consider the minus   and basis point change scenarios relevant at december  due to the current low rate environment 
the alco policy also has established that interest income sensitivity will be considered acceptable if economic value of equity does not decline from the flat rate scenario more than    and in the plus and minus   and basis point scenarios  respectively 
these interest rate scenarios assume that rates increase immediately and permanently 
at december   the company s income simulation model projects that net interest income would increase   and in the plus   and basis point change scenarios 
all of these forecasts are within an acceptable level of interest rate risk per the policies established by alco 
alco did not consider the minus   and basis point change scenarios relevant at december  due to the current low rate environment 
in the event the model indicates an unacceptable level of risk  management could undertake a number of actions that would reduce this risk  including the sale of a portion of the company s available for sale investment portfolio  the use of risk management strategies such as interest rate swaps and caps  or the extension of the maturities of its short term borrowings 
noninterest income noninterest income  principally charges and fees assessed for the use of our services  is a significant contributor to net income 
the following table presents the components of noninterest income for and noninterest income for the twelve months ended changes from the prior year for the twelve months ended december  amount december  service charges on deposit accounts gain on sale of securities mortgage loan origination fees investment and insurance commissions fee income from accounts receivable financing debit card interchange income impairment loss on securities income earned on bank owned life insurance other service charges and fees total noninterest income in noninterest income decreased thousand or to million compared to million for the same period in due primarily to the replacement of our automated overdraft program with an ad hoc program on july  service charges on deposit accounts decreased by thousand or due primarily to a decline in overdraft fees mostly as a result of greater consciousness of the fees by our customers 
gain on sale of securities increased thousand or due to a low rate environment in compared to which resulted in higher market values of securities sold 
mortgage loan origination fees were down by thousand or due to lower production and fewer mortgage originators in compared to as well as the bank offering an in house mortgage product after mid investment and insurance commissions increased by thousand or 
the addition of one new licensed financial advisor in and the maturation of new advisors added in accounted for the majority of the increase in investment and insurance commissions 
fee income from accounts receivable increased by thousand or from to as several clients were added by the bank in this product line in debit card interchange income was up by thousand or due to a high number of debit cards and increased transactions due to the implementation of a debit cards reward program by the bank in late income earned on bank owned life insurance decreased by thousand or due to lower rates in on the underlying life insurance policies 
other service changes and fees were relatively unchanged in absolute dollar terms from to noninterest expense noninterest expense decreased thousand or to million in compared to million in and noninterest expense increased million or in compared to million in the following table presents the components of noninterest expense for and sources of noninterest expense for the twelve months ended changes from the prior year for the twelve months ended december  amount december  salaries employee benefits employee stock ownership plan occupancy expense equipment expense data and items processing professional and advertising stationary and supplies net loss on sale of foreclosed and repossessed assets expenses of foreclosed and repossessed assets telecommunications expense fdic assessment accounts receivable financing expense other expense total noninterest expense salary expense increased thousand or in compared to the increase is the result of employee additions in the production and support areas of the bank as well as general cost of living and merit increases 
employee benefits increased thousand or in over the prior year principally due to an increase in employee group insurance as a result of employee additions in and an increase in supplemental executive retirement plan expense 
as of december  we had the equivalent of full time employees and operated full service banking offices and an office housing our independent wealth management division 
esop expense was thousand in with no esop expense in occupancy expense decreased thousand or in primarily due to a decrease in repairs and maintenance expense 
this is likely due to decreased use of third party maintenance vendors for repairs due to addition of facilities maintenance position 
equipment expense was relatively unchanged from to data and items processing expenses were relatively unchanged from to professional and advertising expenses  which include audit  legal  consulting and marketing and advertising fees  increased thousand in compared to the same period of due to increase marketing to target clients and increased legal fees as a result of problem loan related services 
stationary and supplies expense increased thousand in compared to the same period of resulting primarily from the continued growth in the bank s customer base as well as increased mailings targeting potential clients 
net loss on sale of foreclosed and repossessed assets increased thousand or in compared to as a result of the bank s objective of managing the levels of other real estate by attempting to move real estate at sometimes less than current market values 
expenses of foreclosed and repossessed assets were relatively unchanged from to telecommunication expenses  which include voice and data communications  were relatively unchanged from to fdic insurance decreased thousand in due to the adoption of a new assessment formula by the fdic  effective in the second quarter of accounts receivable financing expense decreased thousand or in compared to the same period in the decrease in this expense items was due to a decrease in the fee paid  in relation to the outstanding receivables  to the vendor the bank uses to administer the accounts receivable program 
other expenses increased thousand or in compared to the same period in increases in this area are attributable to increased emphasis on training and education as well as increased loan servicing costs 
income taxes for the years ended december  and  we recorded income tax expense of thousand and thousand  respectively 
our effective tax rate for the years ended december  and was and  respectively 
the effective rate was significantly lower in compared to due to a decrease in the company s income before income taxes as well as the bank s purchase of municipal securities in late and throughout  some of which are exempt from federal  and in some cases  state income taxes 
analysis of financial condition average earning assets increased to million in  or  from million in earning assets represented of total assets during the year ended december   and and during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the mix of average earning assets changed from december  to december   with loans decreasing from of total assets in to in  and investment securities increasing from of total assets in to in the shift in earning assets from loans to investments was primarily due to two factors 
first  in late and throughout  management began purchasing longer maturity municipal securities and shorter maturity government agency collateralized mortgage obligations as part of an asset liability strategy 
second  higher than predicted loan charge offs coupled with lower than predicted loan demand caused loans to increase only slightly from to average earning assets increased to million in  or  from million in earning assets represented of total assets during the year ended december   and and during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the mix of average earning assets changed from december  to december   with loans increasing from of total assets in to in  and investment securities decreasing from of total assets in to in the shift in earning assets from investments to loans was a conscious strategy in by management as a decline in market yields during left few opportunities to earn acceptable returns on new investment purchases

while management has consciously focused on decreasing its concentration to construction and development loans  it is honoring any commitments to existing credit worthy borrowers 
the decline in construction and development loans does not take into account the advances from january  to december  on unfunded or partially funded one to four family residential construction loans 
residential  one to four family loans increased from million in to million in the increase in this category was a result of a residential loan program introduced by the bank in mid that offered loan terms ranging from eight to twenty years 
residential  or more family loans decreased in from due primarily to the removal of one large loan relationship secured by an apartment complex targeted primarily to college students 
nonfarm  nonresidential loans decreased million from to due to a management s strategy to reduce the bank s exposure to commercial real estate as well as weak demand from credit qualified borrowers 
commercial and industrial loans increased from million in to million in the increase in this loan segment was due to a conscious strategy by the bank to locate and fund more of these loans to decrease its exposure to commercial real estate loans 
the bank s portfolios of loans secured by farmland and consumer loans remained relatively unchanged from to at december   our loan portfolio contained no foreign loans  and we believe the portfolio is adequately diversified 
real estate loans represent approximately of our loan portfolio 
real estate loans are primarily loans secured by real estate  including mortgage and construction loans 
residential mortgage loans accounted for approximately million or of our real estate loans at december  commercial loans are spread throughout a variety of industries  with no particular industry or group of related industries accounting for a significant portion of the commercial loan portfolio 
at december   our ten largest loans accounted for approximately of our loans outstanding 
as of december  we had outstanding loan commitments of approximately million 
the amounts of loans outstanding at the indicated dates are shown in the following table according to loan type

approximately of our loan portfolio is comprised of variable rate loans 
commercial and industrial real estate construction and development others total amount dollars in thousands three months or less over months to months over year to years over years total loans allowance for loan losses we consider the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover estimated probable loan losses relating to the loans outstanding as of each reporting period 
the procedures and methods used in the determination of the allowance necessarily rely upon various judgments and assumptions about economic conditions and other factors affecting our loans 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review our allowance for loan losses 
those agencies may require us to recognize adjustments to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgments about the information available to them at the time of their examinations 
no assurance can be given that we will not in any particular period sustain loan losses that are sizable in relation to the amount reserved or that subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio  in light of conditions and factors then prevailing  will not require significant changes in the allowance for loan losses or future charges to earnings 
the following table summarizes the balances of loans outstanding  average loans outstanding  changes in the allowance arising from charge offs and recoveries by category and additions to the allowance that have been charged to expense 
analysis of the allowance for loan losses at december  dollars in thousands allowance for loan losses at beginning of year charge offs real estate commercial and industrial loans to individuals total charge offs at december  dollars in thousands recoveries real estate mortgage commercial and industrial loans to individuals total recoveries net charge offs recoveries provision for loan losses charged to operations balance at end of period total loans outstanding at year end average loans outstanding for the year ratio of net loan charge offs to average loans outstanding ratio of allowance for loan losses to loans outstanding at period end at december   our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans was  up from at december  the increase in part reflects the increase in our historical loss rate as our charge offs have increased during the past year 
the increase also reflects the recognition of additional loans identified as being impaired 
in evaluating the allowance for loan losses  we prepare an analysis of our current loan portfolio through the use of historical loss rates  homogeneous risk analysis grouping to include probabilities for loss in each group by risk grade  estimation of years to impairment in each homogeneous grouping  analysis of internal credit processes  and past due loan portfolio performance and overall economic conditions  both regionally and nationally 
historical loss calculations for each homogeneous risk group are based on a weighted average loss ratio calculation 
the most previous quarter s loss history is used in the loss history and is adjusted to reflect current losses in the homogeneous risk groups 
current losses translate into a higher loss ratio which is further increased by the associated risk grades within the group 
the impact is to more quickly recognize and increase the loss history in a respective grouping  resulting in an increase in the allowance for that particular homogeneous group 
for those groups with little or no loss history  management bases the historical factor based on current economic conditions and their potential impact on that particular loan group 
loans are considered impaired if  based on current information and events  it is probable that the bank will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the measurement of impaired loans is based on either the fair value of the underlying collateral  the present value of the future cash flows discounted at the historical effective interest rate stipulated in the loan agreement  or the estimated market value of the loan 
in measuring the fair value of the collateral  management uses a comparison to the recent selling price of similar assets  which is consistent with those that would be utilized by unrelated third parties 
as of december   we had loans with a current principal balance of million on the watch list  compared to loans with a current principal balance of million at december  the watch list is the classification utilized by us when we have an initial concern about the financial health of a borrower 
we then gather current financial information about the borrower and evaluate our current risk in the credit 
we will then either move it to substandard or back to its original risk rating after a review of the information 
there are times when we may leave the loan on the watch list  if  in management s opinion  there are risks that cannot be fully evaluated without the passage of time  and we want to review it on a more regular basis 
loans on the watch list are not considered potential problem loans until they are determined by management to be classified as substandard 
loans past due days amounted to million at december  as compared to million at december  past due loans are often regarded as a precursor to further credit problems which would lead to future increases in nonaccrual loans and other real estate owned 
at december  and  there were no loans past due greater than days that were not already placed on nonaccrual 
generally  a loan is placed on nonaccrual status when it becomes days past due as to principal or interest  or when we believe  after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts  that the borrower s financial condition is such that collection of the loan is doubtful 
a payment of interest on a loan that is classified as nonaccrual is applied against the principal balance 
during the years ended december  and  we received approximately thousand and thousand  respectively  in interest income in relation to loans that were on nonaccrual status at the respective year end prior to them being placed on nonaccrual status 
foregone interest income related to loans on nonaccrual status were approximately thousand and thousand  during the years ended december  and  respectively 
while we believe that our management uses the best information available to determine the allowance for loan losses  unforeseen market conditions could result in adjustments to the allowance for loan losses  and net income could be significantly affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the final determination 
because these factors and management s assumptions are subject to change  the allocation is not necessarily indicative of future loan portfolio performance 
loans are charged off against the bank s allowance for loan losses as soon as the loan becomes uncollectible 
unsecured loans are considered uncollectible when no regularly scheduled monthly payment has been made within three months  the loan matured over days ago and has not been renewed or extended or the borrower files for bankruptcy 
secured loans are considered uncollectible when the liquidation of collateral is deemed to be the most likely source of repayment 
once secured loans reach days past due  they are placed into non accrual status unless the loan is considered to be well secured and in process of collection 
if the loan is deemed to be collateral dependent  the principal balance is either written down immediately or reserved as a write down in the bank s allowance model to reflect the current market valuation based on an independent appraisal which may be adjusted by management based on more recent market conditions 
included in the write down is the estimated expense to liquidate the property and typically an additional allowance for the foreclosure discount 
generally  if the loan is unsecured the loan must be charged off in full while if it is secured the loan is charged down to the net liquidation value of the collateral 
net charge offs of million in increased million and million when compared to and  respectively 
net charge offs from real estate secured loans were million  million  and thousand in   and  respectively 
asset quality remains a top priority of the bank 
for the year ending december   net loan charge offs were of average loans compared to for the year ending december  the ratio of net charge offs to average loans increased mainly due to the bank writing down several large collateral dependent loans and completely charging off other loans deemed to be uncollectible 
declining economic conditions resulted in an increased number of impaired collateral dependent loans which resulted in a portion of these loans being charged off 
the increase in the allowance for loan losses to loans to at december  from at december  mostly reflects the increase in our historical loss rate as our charge offs have increased during the past two years 
the ratio of our allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans increased to as of december  compared to at december  the change is the result of our allowance increasing approximately from to and our nonperforming loans decreasing approximately from to commercial and business related real estate secured loans comprise a significant portion of total nonperforming loans 
these types of loans are subject to impairment testing  which determines whether the loan should be written down or charged off to its fair value 
therefore  an increase or a decrease in total nonperforming loans should not always correspond equally with a change in the allowance for loan loss 
allocation of allowance for loan loss at december  amount amount amount amount amount dollars in thousands one to four residential first liens real estate construction and development one to four family junior liens all other real estate secured total real estate loans commercial and industrial consumer unallocated total represents total of all outstanding loans in each category as a percent of total loans outstanding 
management realizes that general economic trends greatly affect loan losses and no assurances can be made about future losses 
management  however  does consider the allowance for loan losses to be adequate at december  loans considered impaired we review our nonperforming loans and other groups of loans based on loan size or other factors for impairment 
at december   we had loans totaling million which includes million in nonperforming loans which were considered to be impaired compared to million at december  loans are considered impaired if  based on current information  circumstances or events  it is probable that the bank will not collect the scheduled payments of principal and interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
however  treating a loan as impaired does not necessarily mean that we expect to incur a loss on that loan  and our impaired loans may include loans that currently are performing in accordance with their terms 
for example  if we believe it is probable that a loan will be collected  but not according to its original agreed upon payment schedule  we may treat that loan as impaired even though we expect that the loan will be repaid or collected in full 
as indicated in the table below  when we believe a loss is probable on a non collateral dependent impaired loan  a portion of our reserve is allocated to that probable loss 
if the loan is deemed to be collateral dependent  the principal balance is written down immediately  or a portion of our reserve is allocated to that probable loss  to reflect the current market valuation based on a current independent appraisal 
the following table sets forth the number and volume of loans net of previous charge offs considered impaired and their associated reserve allocation  if any  at december  and analysis of loans considered impaired number number number as of december  number of loans loan balances outstanding allocated reserves dollars in thousand non accrual loans restructured loans total nonperforming loans other impaired loans with allocated reserves impaired loans without allocated reserves total impaired loans number number number as of december  number of loans loan balances outstanding allocated reserves dollars in thousand non accrual loans restructured loans total nonperforming loans other impaired loans with allocated reserves impaired loans without allocated reserves total impaired loans as of december  there was million in other impaired loans with allocated reserves which represent three loans to two building contractors 
as of december  there were million in other impaired loans with allocated reserves 
of the million  million of the balances represented lot and acquisition and development loans that had relatively small individual balances 
of the thousand in allocated reserves on other impaired loans without allocated reserves  thousand represented management s allocated reserve for loan and acquisition loans 
management estimates the risk of default on the individual balances of these loans by utilizing the current credit grade on the underlying loans  and then multiplies the estimated defaulted balance times an estimated loss of to calculate the allocated reserve 
in the table above the lot and acquisition and development loans are considered one loan 
management discontinued the use of the method of estimating losses on unimpaired lot and acquisition and development loans in and now reviews these loans individually for impairment 
the following table summarizes our nonperforming assets and past due loans at the dates indicated 
nonperforming assets and past due loans december  dollars in thousands non accrual loans loans past due days or more and still accruing restructured loans foreclosed assets and repossessions total a loan is placed on non accrual status when  in our judgment  the collection of interest income appears doubtful or the loan is past due days or more 
interest receivable that has been accrued and is subsequently determined to have doubtful collectability is charged to the appropriate interest income account 
interest on loans that are classified as non accrual is recognized when received 
in some cases  where borrowers are experiencing financial difficulties  loans may be restructured to provide terms significantly different from the original terms 
at december  and  nonperforming assets  loans past due days or more and still accruing  and foreclosed assets and repossessions  were approximately and  respectively  of the loans outstanding at such dates 
the general downturn in the overall economy has contributed to the overall increase in nonperforming assets reflected at year end 
the impact of our impaired loans at december  on our interest income was approximately thousand as we would have accrued thousand in interest income versus the thousand recognized 
any loans that are classified for regulatory purposes as loss  doubtful  substandard or special mention  and that are not included as non performing loans  do not i represent or result from trends or uncertainties that management reasonably expects will materially impact future operating results  or ii represent material credits about which management has any information which causes management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrower to comply with the loan repayment terms 
investment portfolio the composition of our securities portfolio reflects our investment strategy of maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity while providing a relatively stable source of income 
our securities portfolio also provides a balance to interest rate risk and credit risk in other categories of the balance sheet while providing a vehicle for investing available funds  furnishing liquidity and supplying securities to pledge as required collateral for certain deposits and borrowed funds 
we use two categories to classify our securities held to maturity and available for sale 
while we have no plans to liquidate a significant amount of our securities  the securities classified as available for sale may be sold to meet liquidity needs should management deem it to be in our best interest 
our available for sale investment securities totaled million at december   million at december  and million at december  our held to maturity investment securities totaled million at december  and million at december  for the most part during  the bank s investment portfolio strategy consisted of allowing the existing investment portfolio to runoff with regular principal payment and prepayments 
however  the bank did purchase million in investment securities in  which were mostly concentrated in the last three months of the year 
additions to the investment securities portfolio depend to a large extent on the availability of investable funds that are not otherwise needed to satisfy loan demand 
investable funds not otherwise utilized are temporarily invested as federal funds sold or as interest bearing balances at other banks  the level of which is affected by such considerations as near term loan demand and liquidity needs 
subinvestment grade available for sale and held to maturity private label mortgage backed securities are analyzed on a quarterly basis for impairment by utilizing an independent third party that performs an analysis of the estimated principal the bank is expected to collect on these securities 
the results of this analysis determines whether the bank records an impairment loss on these securities 
during the years ended december  and  the company recorded impairment losses of thousand and thousand  respectively

interest bearing checking accounts increased million year over year  driven by what we believe was a move by consumers away from large financial institutions to smaller community banks like ours 
money market deposits increased million from year end to year end  savings deposits increased million from year end to year end  and time deposits declined million from year end to year end the composition of time deposits changed from to  largely due to a million decline in internet generated time deposits due largely to the increase in interest bearing checking accounts noted above 
time deposits greater than or equal to  decreased million year over year  time deposits less than  decreased million from year end to year end  and cdars deposits decreased by million

increases in demand  non interest bearing  and savings and money market accounts in were more than enough to fund our loan growth  even after taking into account the significant decline in time deposit average balances from to the decline in time deposits was largely driven by the planned runoff of internet generated time deposits during the following table is a maturity schedule of our time deposits as of december  time deposit maturity schedule at december  months or less over to months over to months over months total dollars in thousands certificates of deposit less than   or more total borrowings short term debt includes sweep accounts  advances from the fhlb having maturities of one year or less  federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements 
the company had no short term debt at december  and at both december  and we had federal funds purchased lines of credit totaling million 
these lines are intended for short term borrowings and are subject to restrictions limiting the frequency and terms of advances 
the company had no outstanding balances under these lines of credit at december  long term debt consists of advances from fhlb with maturities greater than one year 
there were no long term borrowings from the fhlb at december  our long term borrowings from the fhlb totaled million on december  federal home loan bank advances as a member of the fhlb  the bank has the ability to borrow up to of total assets in the form of fhlb advances 
there were no fhlb advances at december  at december   outstanding fhlb advances of million were classified as long term debt 
the average amount outstanding during and was million and million  respectively 
approximately million in first and second lien one to four family residential loans were pledged as collateral for short and long term fhlb advances at december  junior subordinated debentures in  the company issued  of junior subordinated debentures to the trust in exchange for the proceeds of trust preferred securities issued by the trust 
the junior subordinated debentures are included in long term debt and the company s equity interest in the trust is included in other assets 
the junior subordinated debentures pay interest quarterly at an annual rate  reset quarterly  equal to three month libor plus 
the debentures are redeemable on june  or afterwards  in whole or in part  on any december  march  june or september redemption is mandatory at june  the bank guarantees the trust preferred securities through the combined operations of the junior subordinated debentures and other related documents 
the bank s obligations under the guarantee are unsecured and subordinate to the senior and subordinated indebtedness of the bank 
the trust preferred securities presently qualify as tier regulatory capital and are reported in federal reserve regulatory reports as a minority consolidated interest in a consolidated subsidiary 
the junior subordinated debentures do not qualify as tier regulatory capital 
on march   the federal reserve board issued a final rule stating that trust preferred securities will continue to be included in tier capital  subject to stricter quantitative and qualitative standards 
for bank holding companies  trust preferred securities will continue to be included in tier capital up to of core capital elements including trust preferred securities net of goodwill less any associated deferred tax liability 
the following table details the maturities and rates of our borrowings  at december  maturity date balance current rate type of debt  rate repricing frequency junior subordinated debentures  quarterly  next reprice date liquidity liquidity refers to our continuing ability to meet deposit withdrawals  fund loan and capital expenditure commitments  maintain reserve requirements  pay operating expenses and provide funds for payment of dividends  debt service and other operational requirements 
liquidity is immediately available from five major sources a cash on hand and on deposit at other banks  b the outstanding balance of federal funds sold  c lines for the purchase of federal funds from other banks  d lines of credit established at the fhlb  less existing advances  and e our investment securities portfolio 
all our debt securities are of investment grade quality and  if the need arises  can promptly be liquidated on the open market or pledged as collateral for short term borrowing 
consistent with our general approach to liquidity management  loans and other assets of the bank are funded primarily using a core of local deposits  proceeds from retail repurchase agreements and excess bank capital 
during and  the bank relied less heavily on time deposits to meet its liquidity needs 
the bank intends to focus on increasing core deposits in order to decrease the amount of wholesale and retail time deposits 
we are a member of the federal home loan bank of atlanta 
membership  along with a blanket collateral commitment of our one to four family residential mortgage loan portfolio  as well as our home equity loan portfolio  provided us the ability to draw up to million and million of advances from the fhlb at december  and  respectively 
there were no borrowings from the fhlb at december  our borrowings from the fhlb totaled million on december  as a requirement for membership  we invest in stock of the fhlb in the amount of of our outstanding residential loans or of our outstanding advances from the fhlb  whichever is greater 
that stock is pledged as collateral for any fhlb advances drawn by us 
at december   we owned  shares of the fhlb s par value capital stock  compared to  shares at december  no ready market exists for fhlb stock  which is carried at cost 
we also had unsecured federal funds lines in the aggregate amount of million available to us at december  under which we can borrow funds to meet short term liquidity needs 
at december   we did not have any advances under these federal funds lines 
another source of funding available is loan participations sold to other commercial banks in which we retain the servicing rights 
as of december   we had thousand in loan participations sold 
we believe that our liquidity sources are adequate to meet our operating needs 
capital resources and stockholders equity as of december   our total stockholders equity was million consisting of common shareholders equity of million and preferred stock of million compared with total shareholders equity of million consisting of common shareholders equity of million and preferred stock of million as of december  on january   the company entered into an agreement with the us treasury 
the company issued and sold to the us treasury  shares of the company s series a preferred stock 
the series a preferred stock calls for cumulative dividends at a rate of per year for the first five years  and at a rate of per year in following years 
the company also issued a warrant to purchase  shares of the company s common stock 
the company received million in cash  in exchange for the series a preferred stock and the warrant 
common stockholders equity remained unchanged from december  to december   although there were some changes in the different categories 
we experienced net income in of thousand and a net increase in net unrealized gains on available for sale securities and a reclassification adjustment for gains on sales of investment securities included in net income of thousand 
we paid dividends of thousand on preferred shares and also had preferred stock accretion of thousand 
the bank is subject to minimum capital requirements 
as the following table indicates  at december   all capital ratios place the bank in excess of the minimum necessary to be considered well capitalized under bank regulatory guidelines 
at december  actual ratio minimum requirement well capitalized requirement total risk based capital ratio tier risk based capital ratio leverage ratio inflation and other issues because our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature  the effect of inflation on our assets is less significant compared to most commercial and industrial companies 
however  inflation does have an impact on the growth of total assets in the banking industry and the resulting need to increase capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio 
inflation also has a significant effect on other expenses  which tend to rise during periods of general inflation 
notwithstanding these effects of inflation  management believes our financial results are influenced more by our ability to react to changes in interest rates than by inflation 
except as discussed in this management s discussion and analysis  management is not aware of trends  events or uncertainties that will have or that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the liquidity  capital resources or operations 
management is not aware of any current recommendations by regulatory authorities which  if they were implemented  would have such an effect
