business overview the following discussion and analysis is intended to provide an investor with a narrative of our financial results and an evaluation of our financial condition and results of operations 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended december   both appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
ceva is the world s leading licensor of dsp cores and platform solutions 
our technologies are widely licensed and power some of the world s leading semiconductor and original equipment manufacturer oem companies 
in  our licensees shipped more than one billion ceva powered chipsets targeted for a wide range of diverse end markets 
shipments of ceva powered chipsets increased over  illustrating continued  strong market deployment of our technology 
during the past six years  our business has shown profitability growth and market share expansion as a result of the widespread deployment of our dsp cores with all major handset oems huawei  lg electronics  motorola  nokia  samsung  sony  zte and a major us based smartphone manufacturer 
this positive trend is evident from our royalty revenues which increased by in over based on internal data and strategy analytics worldwide shipment data  ceva s worldwide market share of cellular baseband chips that incorporate our technologies reached approximately of the worldwide shipment volume based on third quarter worldwide shipments 
revenues derived from the handsets and mobile broadband markets accounted for approximately of our total revenues in the mobile broadband space is a category of wireless enabled products  among which are tablets  notebooks  electronic books  machine to machine devices  automotive applications and smart grids 
we believe the full scale migration to our dsp cores and technologies in the handsets and mobile broadband markets has not been fully realized and continues to progress 
specifically  we believe texas instruments exit from the baseband market  after historically having been a large player in this market  as well as the emergence of merchant chips from companies such as broadcom  intel and spreadtrum  all of whom are our customers  are strong positive drivers for our future market share expansion 
moreover  strategy analytics forecasts that worldwide cellular baseband shipments will grow by in to reach billion units 
we believe that the majority of this growth will come from advanced feature phone and low cost smartphone demands in developing countries and the broader adoption of advanced smartphones in mature markets 
we are well positioned to capitalize on the growth in the above segments  as well as growth from other mobile connected devices such as tablets  electronic books and other machine to machine devices  as key chip suppliers serving these markets use our technologies broadly 
beyond products enabled by our technologies for baseband in handsets and mobile broadband markets  we continue to target growth in non baseband applications  such as audio  imaging  vision and connectivity 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed licensing agreements for audio in smart tvs  connectivity in smartphones and our first imaging platform  the mm dsp core 

table of contents we believe the following four market trends represent significant growth drivers for the company the evolution of cellular networks  specifically the growth of g networks in emerging countries and the migration from g to lte in developed countries 
ceva is well positioned to leverage these opportunities with a broad range of technologies and broad customer base 
the emergence of g and g connectivity in devices beyond handsets such as tablets  laptops  automotive and surveillance 
our range of baseband dsps are ideal for these promising new segments 
the mass adoption and feature set enhancements of smartphones 
we offer a range of new dsps and software technologies to address the needs for advanced imaging and high fidelity audio 
it is an incremental business to our already strong foothold in the baseband market 
the proliferation of smart devices in the home  including the emergence smart tv  or smart set top boxes and smartgrid 
we aim to leverage our mobile experience and technology base to expand into these markets 
notwithstanding the various growth opportunities we have outlined above  our business operates in a highly competitive environment 
competition has historically increased pricing pressures for our products and decreased our average selling prices 
royalty payments under our existing license agreements also could be lower than currently anticipated for a variety of reasons  including decreased royalty rates triggered by larger volume shipments or lower royalty rates negotiated with customers due to competitive pressure 
moreover  some of our competitors have reduced their licensing and royalty fees to attract customers and expand their market share 
in order to penetrate new markets and maintain our market share with our existing products  we may need to offer our products in the future at lower prices which may result in lower profits 
in addition  our future growth is dependent not only on the continued success of our existing products but also the successful introduction of new products  which requires the dedication of resources into research and development which in turn may increase our operating expenses 
we anticipate that our operating expenses will be higher for in comparison to  mainly due to an increase in non cash equity based compensation expenses due to anticipated new equity grants to employees  increased investments in research and development in next generation baseband processors for lte advance as well as our new mm hd imaging and vision platform  and lower government research and development grants 
furthermore  since our products are incorporated into end products of our oem customers  our business is very dependent on our oem customers ability to achieve market acceptance of their end products in the handsets and consumer electronic markets  which are similarly very competitive 
the ever changing nature of the market also affects our continued business growth potential 
for example  the success of our imaging and audio products is highly dependent on the market adoption of new services and products  such as smartphones  tablets  smart tvs and set top boxes 
in addition  our business is affected by market conditions in emerging markets  such as india  latin america and africa  where the penetration of handsets  especially low cost phones  could generate future growth potential for our business 
the maintenance of our competitive position and our future growth also are dependent on our ability to adapt to ever changing technologies  short product life cycles  evolving industry standards  changing customer needs and the trend towards cellular connectivity  and voice  audio and video convergence in the markets that we operate 
moreover  due to the uncertainty about the sustainability of the market recovery  it is extremely difficult for our customers  our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities 
therefore  current economic conditions  and specifically the volatility in the semiconductor and consumer electronics industries  and consolidation in the semiconductor industry  could seriously impact our revenue and harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
as a result  our past operating results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
we currently anticipate that the first quarter of to be a sequentially down quarter as third quarter shipments of ceva powered chipsets  as reflected in our fourth quarter royalty revenues  were an all time record high 
also  we currently anticipate that the second quarter of to be a down quarter due to the typical seasonality trend we experience annually 

table of contents critical accounting policies  estimates and assumptions our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states us gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates  judgments or assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition  allowances for doubtful accounts  income taxes  equity based compensation  and impairment of marketable securities 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by us gaap and does not require management s judgment in its application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result 
revenue recognition significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the recognition of revenue in any accounting period 
material differences in the amount of revenue in any given period may result if these judgments or estimates prove to be incorrect or if management s estimates change on the basis of development of business or market conditions 
management s judgments and estimates have been applied consistently and have been reliable historically 
we generate our revenues from licensing intellectual property  which in certain circumstances is modified for customer specific requirements  royalty revenues and other revenues  which include revenues from support  training and sale of development systems 
we license our ip to semiconductor companies throughout the world 
these semiconductor companies then manufacture  market and sell custom designed chipsets to oems of a variety of consumer electronics products 
we also license our technology directly to oems  which are considered end users 
we account for our ip license revenues and related services in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc no 
 software revenue recognition 
revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and no further obligation exists  delivery has occurred  the license fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
a license may be perpetual or time limited in its application 
revenue earned on licensing arrangements involving multiple elements are allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of the elements 
however  with respect to certain transactions  for multiple element transactions  revenue can be recognized under the residual method when vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for all undelivered elements and vsoe does not exist for one of the delivered elements 
vsoe of fair value of the undelivered elements is determined based on the substantive renewal rate as stated in the agreement 
in certain cases in which we undertake services that are not essential to the functionality of the ip license and we did not establish a vsoe of fair value for the services  the entire arrangement fee is recognized as the services are performed 

table of contents extended payment terms in a licensing arrangement may indicate that the license fees are not deemed to be fixed or determinable 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as payments become due from the customer unless collection is not considered reasonably assured  then revenue is recognized as payments are collected from the customer  provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
revenues from license fees that involve significant customization of our ip to customer specific specifications are recognized in accordance with the principles set out in fasb asc no 
 construction type and production type contracts recognition  using contract accounting on a percentage of completion method 
the amount of revenue recognized is based on the total license fees under the agreement and the percentage of completion achieved 
the percentage of completion is measured by the actual time incurred to date on the project compared to the total estimated project requirements  which correspond to the costs related to earned revenues 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made during the period in which such losses are first determined  in the amount of the estimated loss on the entire contract 
royalties from licensing the right to use our ip are recognized on a quarterly basis in arrears as we receive quarterly shipment reports from our licensees 
we determine such revenues by receiving confirmation of sales subject to royalties from licensees 
non refundable payments on account of future royalties prepaid royalties are recognized upon payment becoming due  provided no future obligation exists 
in addition to license fees  contracts with customers generally contain an agreement to provide for post contract support and training  which consists of telephone or e mail support  correction of errors bug fixing and unspecified updates and upgrades 
fees for post contract support  which takes place after delivery to the customer  are specified in the contract and are generally mandatory for the first year 
after the mandatory period  the customer may extend the support agreement on similar terms on an annual basis 
we recognize revenue for post contract support on a straight line basis over the period for which technical support is contractually agreed to be provided to the licensee 
revenue from training is recognized as the training is performed 
revenue from the sale of development systems is recognized when title to the product passes to the customer and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
we usually do not provide rights of return 
when rights of return are included in the license agreements  revenue is deferred until rights of return expire 
allowances for doubtful accounts we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for the portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful 
provisions are made based upon a detailed review of all significant outstanding receivables 
in determining the provision  we analyze our historical collection experience and current economic trends 
we reassess these allowances each accounting period 
historically  our actual losses and credits have been consistent with these provisions 
if actual payment experience with our customers is different from our estimates  adjustments to these allowances may be necessary  resulting in additional charges to our statements of income 
allowance for doubtful accounts amounted to  as of both december  and income taxes we are subject to income taxes mainly in israel  the us and ireland 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
based on the guidance in asc income taxes  we use a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement 

table of contents although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit  the refinement of an estimate or changes in tax laws 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate 
accounting for tax positions requires judgments  including estimating reserves for potential uncertainties 
we also assess our ability to utilize tax attributes  including those in the form of carry forwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements 
we do not record valuation allowances for deferred tax assets that we believe are more likely than not to be realized in future periods 
while we believe the resulting tax balances as of december  and are appropriately accounted for  the ultimate outcome of such matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  for further information regarding income taxes 
we have filed or are in the process of filing local and foreign tax returns that are subject to audit by the respective tax authorities 
the amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by the tax authorities  which often result in proposed assessments 
we believe that we adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcomes related to tax audits and settlement 
however  our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved  audits are closed or when statute of limitations on potential assessments expire 
accounting for equity based compensation we account for equity based compensation in accordance with fasb asc no 
 stock compensation which requires the recognition of compensation expenses based on estimated fair values for all equity based awards made to employees and non employee directors 
we estimate the fair value of equity based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
accordingly  the value of the portion of an award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period in our consolidated statement of income 
we recognize compensation expenses for the value of our awards  which have graded vesting based on the accelerated attribution method over the requisite service period of each of the awards  net of estimated forfeitures 
estimated forfeitures are based on actual historical pre vesting forfeitures 
we use the monte carlo simulation model for options granted 
expected volatility was calculated based upon actual historical stock price movements over the most recent periods ending on the grant date  equal to the expected option term 
we have historically not paid dividends and have no foreseeable plans to issue dividends 
the risk free interest rate is based on the yield from us treasury zero coupon bonds with an equivalent term 
the monte carlo model also considers the contractual term of the option  the probability that the option will be exercised prior to the end of its contractual life  and the probability of termination or retirement of the option holder in computing the value of the option 
although our management believes that their estimates and judgments about equity based compensation expense are reasonable  actual results and future changes in estimates may differ substantially from our current estimates 
impairment of marketable securities marketable securities consist of certificates of deposits  corporate bonds and government securities 
we determine the appropriate classification of marketable securities at the time of purchase and re evaluate such designation at each balance sheet date 
in accordance with fasb asc no 
 investment debt and equity securities  we classify marketable securities as available for sale 
available for sale securities are stated at fair 
table of contents value  with unrealized gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a separate component of stockholders equity  net of taxes 
realized gains and losses on sales of marketable securities  as determined on a specific identification basis  are included in financial income  net 
the amortized cost of marketable securities is adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount to maturity  both of which  together with interest  are included in financial income  net 
we have classified all marketable securities as short term  even though the stated maturity date may be one year or more beyond the current balance sheet date  because we may sell these securities prior to maturity to meet liquidity needs or as part of risk versus reward objectives 
we recognize an impairment charge when a decline in the fair value of our investments in debt securities below the cost basis of such securities is judged to be other than temporary 
the determination of credit losses requires significant judgment and actual results may be materially different from our estimates 
factors considered in making such a determination include the duration and severity of the impairment  the reason for the decline in value  the ability of the issuer to meet payment obligations  the potential recovery period and our intent to sell  including whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the investment before recovery of cost basis 
for securities that are deemed other than temporarily impaired  the amount of impairment is recognized in the statement of income and is limited to the amount related to credit losses  while impairment related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income 
during the years ended december   and  no other than temporary impairment were recorded related to our marketable securities 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 topic presentation of comprehensive income asu  which requires an entity to present total comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements and eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods  beginning after december  the adoption of asu will not have an impact on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued asu no 
 topic intangibles goodwill and other asu  which amends topic to allow an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
an entity would not be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines  based the qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
this guidance is effective for annual and interim goodwill tests performed for years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted 
the adoption of asu is not expected to have an impact on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 topic comprehensive income asu  which indefinitely deferred certain provisions of asu  including the requirement to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in both the statement in which net income is presented and the statement in which other comprehensive income is presented 
this amendment is effective for both annual and interim financial statements beginning after december  the adoption of asu will not have an impact on our financial statements

the increase in total revenues from to principally reflected a combination of significantly higher royalty revenues and slightly higher other revenues  offset by slightly lower licensing revenues 
we generate royalty revenue from our customers based on two models royalties paid by our customers during the period in which they ship units of chipsets incorporating our technologies  which we refer to as per unit royalties  and royalties which are paid in a lump sum and in advance to cover a pre defined fixed number of future unit shipments  which we refer to as prepaid royalties 
in either case  these royalties are non refundable payments and are recognized when payment becomes due  provided no future obligation exists 
prepaid royalties 
table of contents are recognized under our licensing revenue line and accounted for  and of our total revenues in  and  respectively 
only royalty revenue from customers who are paying as they ship units of chipsets incorporating our technology is recognized in our royalty revenue line 
these per unit royalties are invoiced and recognized on a quarterly basis in arrears as we receive quarterly shipment reports from our licensees 
in  three customers accounted for  and of our total revenues  compared to three different mix of customers that accounted for  and of our total revenues in and two customers that accounted for and of our total revenues in because of the nature of our license agreements and the associated large initial payments due  the identity of major customers generally varies from period to period  and we do not believe that we are materially dependent on any one specific customer or any specific small number of customers 
our five largest customers accounted for of our total revenues in both and and in this trend is also explained in part by consolidation in the semiconductor industry

we have significant operations in israel and the republic of ireland and a substantial portion of our taxable income is generated there 
currently  our israeli and irish subsidiaries are taxed at rates substantially lower than us tax rates 
our irish subsidiary qualified for a tax rate on its trade until december  since january   a new tax rate of is in effect 
interest income generated by our irish subsidiary is taxed at a rate of 
our israeli subsidiary is entitled to various tax benefits by virtue of the approved enterprise and or benefited enterprise status granted to its eight investment programs  as defined by the israeli investment law  which has resulted in a decrease in the effective tax rate otherwise applicable to our israeli subsidiary 
in accordance with the investment law  our israeli subsidiary s investment programs are tax exempt for a period of two to four years commencing from the year the program first earns taxable income  and is subject to corporate taxes at the rate of to  depending upon the level of foreign ownership  for an additional period of up to a total of six to eight years from when the tax exemption ends 
the period of tax rate for approved enterprises is limited to the earlier of years from the commencement of production  or years from the approval date  and for benefited enterprises  years starting from the year of election 
the tax benefits under our israeli subsidiary s first four investment programs have expired and are subject to corporate tax of in  in and in however  our israeli operating subsidiary received in an approval for the erosion of tax basis in respect to its second  third and fourth investment programs  and as a result no taxable income was attributed to these investment programs

we believe that our current cash on hand  short term deposits and marketable securities  along with cash from operations  will provide sufficient capital to fund our operations for at least the next months 
we cannot provide assurance  however  that the underlying assumed levels of revenues and expenses will prove to be accurate 
in addition  as part of our business strategy  we occasionally evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses  products and technologies and minority equity investments 
accordingly  a portion of our available cash may be used at any time for the acquisition of complementary products or businesses or minority equity investments 
such potential transactions may require substantial capital resources  which may require us to seek additional debt or equity financing 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition or investment candidates  complete acquisitions or investments  integrate acquired businesses into our current operations  or expand into new markets 
furthermore  we cannot provide assurance that additional financing will be available to us in any required time frame and on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
see risk factors we may seek to expand our business in ways that could result in diversion of resources and extra expenses

contractual obligations the table below presents the principal categories of our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations leasehold properties operating lease obligations other purchase obligations severance pay total operating leasehold obligations principally relate to our offices in ireland  israel and the united states 
other operating lease obligations relate to license agreements entered into for maintenance of design tools 
purchase obligations consist of capital and operating purchase order commitments 
other than set forth in the table above  we have no long term debt or capital lease obligations 
severance pay relates to accrued severance obligations to our israeli employees as required under israeli labor laws 
these obligations are payable only upon termination  retirement or death of the respective employee 
of this amount  only  is unfunded 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as such term is defined in recently enacted rules by the securities and exchange commission  that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk a majority of our revenues and a portion of our expenses are transacted in us dollars and our assets and liabilities together with our cash holdings are predominately denominated in us dollars 
however  the majority of our expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  principally the euro  the nis and the british pound 
increases in volatility of the exchange rates of currencies other than the us dollar versus the us dollar could have an adverse effect on the expenses and liabilities that we incur when remeasured into us dollars 
we review our monthly expected non us dollar denominated expenditures and look to hold equivalent non us dollar cash balances to mitigate currency fluctuations 
this has resulted in a foreign exchange loss of  and million for  and  respectively 
the foreign exchange losses arose principally on the euro and the nis assets and liabilities as a result of the currency fluctuations of the euro and the nis against the dollar 
as a result of currency fluctuations and the remeasurement of non us dollar denominated expenditures to non us dollars for financial reporting purposes  we may experience fluctuations in our operating results on an annual and quarterly basis 
to protect against the increase in value of forecasted foreign currency cash flow resulting from salaries paid in currencies other than the us dollar during the year  we instituted a foreign currency cash flow hedging program starting in the second quarter of we hedge portions of the anticipated payroll for our non us employees denominated in currencies other than the us dollar for a period of one to twelve months with forward and option contracts 
during  and  we recorded accumulated other comprehensive loss of  accumulated other comprehensive gain of  and accumulated other comprehensive loss of  respectively  from our forward and option contracts  net of taxes  with respect to anticipated payroll expenses for our non us employees 
as of december   the amount of other comprehensive loss from our forward and option contracts  net of taxes  was  which will be recorded in the consolidated statements of income during the following months 
we recognized a net gain of million for both and and a net loss of million for  related to forward and options contracts 
we note that hedging transactions may not successfully mitigate losses caused by currency fluctuations 
we expect to continue to experience the effect of exchange rate and currency fluctuations on an annual and quarterly basis 
the majority of our cash and cash equivalents are invested in high grade certificates of deposits with major us  european and israeli banks 
generally  cash and cash equivalents and bank deposits may be redeemed and therefore minimal credit risk exists with respect to them 
nonetheless  deposits with these banks exceed the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic insurance limits or similar limits in foreign jurisdictions  to the extent such deposits are even insured in such foreign jurisdictions 
while we monitor on a systematic basis the cash and cash equivalent balances in the operating accounts and adjust the balances as appropriate  these balances could be impacted if one or more of the financial institutions with which we deposit our funds fails or is subject to other adverse conditions in the financial or credit markets 
to date  we have experienced no loss of principal or lack of access to our invested cash or cash equivalents  however  we can provide no assurance that access to our invested cash and cash equivalents will not be affected if the financial institutions that we hold our cash and cash equivalents fail 
we hold an investment portfolio consisting principally of corporate bonds 
we intend  and have the ability  to hold such investments until recovery of temporary declines in market value or maturity  accordingly  as of december   we believe the losses associated with our investments are temporary and no impairment loss was recognized in however  we can provide no assurance that we will recover present declines in the market value of our investments

we are exposed primarily to fluctuations in the level of us israeli and emu european monetary union interest rates 
to the extent that interest rates rise  fixed interest investments may be adversely impacted  whereas a decline in interest rates may decrease the anticipated interest income for variable rate investments 
we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposures on our investment securities because the majority of our investments are short term 
we currently do not have any derivative instruments but may put them in place in the future 
fluctuations in interest rates within our investment portfolio have not had  and we do not currently anticipate such fluctuations will have  a material effect on our financial position on an annual or quarterly basis
