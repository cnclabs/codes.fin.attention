status of operations mortgage and real estate services the mortgage and real estate services have been developed as part of a centralized platform to operate synergistically to maximize revenues and profits 
the integrated services platform includes the mortgage lending operations and portfolio loss mitigation and real estate services 

table of contents mortgage lending operations during  the company continued to expand its mortgage lending activities increasing loan originations and loan sales 
during the year ended december   the company originated million and sold million of loans  respectively  as compared to million and million of loans originated and sold  respectively  in the company is currently focusing on originating fannie mae  freddie mac  and government loans as it believes that having the ability to sell loans to fannie mae  freddie mac  and issue ginnie mae securities makes it more competitive in the overall mortgage origination market with regard to products  pricing  operational efficiencies and overall recruitment of higher quality loan originators 
consistent with the company s strategy  during  the company sold million in service retained loans to fannie mae and freddie mac and issued million in ginnie mae securities through its amerihome mortgage corp indirect subsidiary  and sold million in loans on a service released basis to other investors 
as a result  the mortgage servicing portfolio increased to million in unpaid principal balance at december  as compared to million at december  the company has hired a nationally recognized residential mortgage servicer to sub service the servicing portfolio 
although the company uses the sub servicer to provide primary servicing and certain default servicing functions  the company s default management team  experienced in loss mitigation and real estate recovery  monitors and surveys the performance of the mortgage servicing portfolio 
incurring the cost of both a sub servicer and an internal default management team reduces net servicing income  but it is an important investment used to minimize delinquencies and minimize repurchase risk 
in march  the company opened regional production offices in the pacific northwest and gulf coast regions giving the company origination capabilities throughout the entire west coast and gulf coast regions 
included in the originations balances stated above  during the year ended december   these new production offices contributed approximately million in originations of primarily agency and government insured residential mortgage loans 
to facilitate the growth of the mortgage lending operations the company increased its warehouse borrowings capacity to million at december  from million at december  in  the mortgage lending operations has been successful in increasing its monthly lending origination volumes to be in excess of million 
however  although the mortgage lending revenues increased in  expenses associated with the mortgage lending activities significantly increased also 
the increase in expenses was primarily due to start up and expansion costs with opening new offices  hiring staff  purchasing equipment  investing in technology and the supplemental default management team as discussed above 
specifically  as the company attempts to build a purchase money centric platform with a significant amount of retail originated loans  the related start up costs for this type of origination platform will be higher than a wholesale refinance focused mortgage operation 
in addition  the company has made small investments in proprietary technologies that will further support our expansion of retail originated purchase money mortgages along with more competitive recruitment of realtor direct loan officers 
the company believes this is the right strategy in the long term as interest rates on mortgage loans are expected to rise in the future  which will greatly reduce the percentage of refinance transactions to more historical percentages 
in order for the mortgage operations to achieve profitability  we will need to i increase overall origination volumes  ii improve lending revenues by originating a higher percentage of retail loans and products with wider margins and greater loan fees and iii reduce lending operating costs through increased operational efficiencies  or some combination of them 
portfolio loss mitigation and real estate services the company provides portfolio loss mitigation and real estate services including reo surveillance and disposition services  default 
table of contents surveillance and loss recovery services  short sale and real estate brokerage services  portfolio monitoring and reporting services 
although the company seeks to expand its portfolio loss mitigation and real estate services to more third parties in the marketplace  the revenues from these business activities have historically been generated from the company s long term mortgage portfolio 
furthermore  as the distressed mortgage and real estate markets remain unstable and uncertain due to the number of foreclosure properties that need to be sold  there remains uncertainty about the ongoing need and delivery of these services in the future 
title and escrow during the third quarter  the company received an offer to sell its interest in the title insurance company 
after consideration of the increasing competition and lower margins in the title insurance industry along with a decision to focus the company s efforts on expanding the mortgage lending platform  the company s board of directors determined it was in the company s best interest to sell its interest in the title insurance company in september in september and october  the company sold its interest in experience  inc  the parent of the title insurance company  for million  recording a total gain of approximately million 
for the three and twelve months ended december  and  mortgage and real estate services fees were as follows for the three months ended december  for the twelve months ended december  real estate services and recovery fees mortgage lending title and escrow loss mitigation fees portfolio service fees total mortgage and real estate services fees long term mortgage portfolio although we have seen some stabilization and improvement in defaults  the portfolio continues to suffer losses and may continue for the foreseeable future until we see a significant decline in the number of foreclosure properties in the market 
existing conditions are unprecedented and result in uncertainty around the long term performance of the portfolio 
at december   our residual interest in securitizations represented by the difference between total trust assets and total trust liabilities increased to million  compared to million at december  the increase in residual fair value in was primarily due to a reduction in forward libor interest rates partially offset by cash received during the year 
in previous years  the company securitized mortgage loans by transferring originated residential single family mortgage loans and multifamily commercial loans the transferred assets into non recourse bankruptcy remote trusts which in turn issued tranches of bonds to investors supported only by the cash flows of the transferred assets 
because the assets and liabilities in the securitizations are nonrecourse to the company  the bondholders cannot look to the company for repayment of their bonds in the event of a shortfall 
these securitizations were structured to include interest rate derivatives 
the company retained the residual interest in each trust  and in most cases would perform 
table of contents the master servicing 
a trustee and servicer  unrelated to us  would be named for each securitization 
cash flows from the loans the loan payments and liquidation of foreclosed real estate properties collected by the loan servicer are remitted to the master servicer 
the master servicer remits payments to the trustee who remits payments to the bondholders investors 
the servicer collects loan payments and performs loss mitigation activities for defaulted loans 
these activities include foreclosing on properties securing defaulted loans  which results in reo 
in accordance with gaap  the company is required to consolidate all but one of these trusts as the company is not the master servicer on our statement of financial condition and results of operations 
for the one trust the company did not consolidate  the residual interest is reported as investment securities available for sale 
for the trusts the company did consolidate  the loans are included in the statement of financial condition as securitized mortgage collateral  the foreclosed loans are included in the statement of financial condition as real estate owned and the various bond tranches owned by investors are included in the statement of financial condition as securitized mortgage borrowings 
any interest rate derivatives remaining in the trusts are included in our statement of financial condition as derivative assets or derivative liabilities  respectively 
to the extent there is excess overcollateralization as defined in the securitization agreements in these securitization trusts  the company receives cash flows from the excess interest collected monthly from the residual interest the company owns 
because i the company elected the fair value option on the securitized mortgage collateral  securitized mortgage borrowings  ii derivative assets liabilities are carried at fair value as required by gaap  and iii real estate owned is reflected at net realizable value nrv  which closely approximates fair market value  the net of the trust assets and trust liabilities represents the estimated fair value of the residual interests the company owns 
to estimate fair value of the assets and liabilities within the securitization trusts each reporting period  management uses an industry standard valuation and analytical model that is updated monthly with current collateral  real estate  derivative  bond and cost servicer  trustee  etc 
information for each securitization trust 
the company employs an internal process to validate the accuracy of the model as well as the data within this model 
forecasted assumptions  sometimes referred to as curves  for defaults  loss severity  interest rates libor and prepayments are input into the valuation model for each securitization trust 
the company hires third party experts to provide forecasted curves for the aforementioned assumptions for each of the securitizations 
before inputting this information into the model  management employs a process to qualitatively and quantitatively review the assumption curves for reasonableness using other information gathered from the mortgage and real estate market ie  third party home price indices  published industry reports discussing regional mortgage and commercial loan performance and delinquency as well as actual default and foreclosure information for each trust from the respective trustees 
the company uses the valuation model to generate the expected cash flows to be collected from the trust assets and the expected required bondholder distribution trust liabilities 
to the extent that the trusts are overcollateralized  the company may receive the excess interest as the holder of the residual interest 
the information above provides us with the future expected cash flows for the securitized mortgage collateral  real estate owned  securitized mortgage borrowings  derivative assets liabilities  and the residual interests 
to determine the discount rates to apply to these cash flows  the company gathers information from the bond pricing services and other market participants regarding estimated investor required yields for each bond tranche 
based on that information and the collateral type and vintage  the company determines an acceptable range of expected yields an investor would require including an appropriate risk premium for each bond tranche 
the company uses the blended yield of the bond tranches together with the residual interests to determine an appropriate yield for the securitized

at december   cash decreased to million from million at december  the primary sources of cash between periods were million in fees generated from the mortgage and real estate services  million from residual interests in securitizations net of the million restricted excess cash in the reserve account and million from the issuance of the note payable 
offsetting the sources of cash were operating expenses totaling million  payments on the notes payable of million and settlements of repurchase requests associated with loans sold by the discontinued non conforming mortgage operations of approximately million 
since our consolidated and unconsolidated securitization trusts are nonrecourse to us  we have netted trust assets and liabilities to present the company s interest in these trusts more simply  which are considered our residual interests in securitizations 
for unconsolidated securitizations our residual interests represent the fair value of investment securities available for sale 
for consolidated securitizations  our residual interests are represented by the fair value of securitized mortgage collateral and real estate owned  offset by the fair value of securitized mortgage borrowings and net derivative liabilities 
we receive cash flows from our residual interests in securitizations to the extent they are available after required distributions to bondholders and maintaining specified overcollateralization levels and other specified parameters such as maximum delinquency and cumulative default within the trusts 
the estimated fair value of the residual interests  represented by the difference in the fair value of total trust assets and total trust liabilities  was million at december   compared to million at december  at december   the note payable was million as compared to million at december  during  the company entered into a new million structured debt agreement with the same noteholder as the previous debt agreement and used a portion of the proceeds to pay off the million balance owed on the previous debt agreement 
the company received 
table of contents proceeds of million  net of the aforementioned payoff  million discount  and transaction costs of approximately thousand 
as of december   the carrying value of the note was million  net of a thousand discount 
the note s maturity was october subsequent to december   the company entered into a new million structured debt agreement using eight of the company s residual interests net trust assets as collateral 
the company used a portion of the proceeds to pay off the thousand balance owed on the previous debt agreement 
the company received proceeds of million  net of the aforementioned payoff and transaction costs of approximately thousand 
it bears interest at a fixed rate of per annum and is amortized in equal principal payments over months 
at december   the balance of deferred charge was million 
for the year ended december   the company recorded million in income tax expense resulting from deferred charge impairment write downs based on changes in estimated fair value of securitized mortgage collateral 
the deferred charge arose as a result of the deferral of income tax expense on inter company profits that resulted from the sale of mortgages from taxable subsidiaries to imh in prior years when imh was a reit 
this balance is recorded as required by gaap and does not have any realizable cash value 
in previous years when our discontinued operations sold loans to investors  we were required to make normal and customary representations and warranties about the loans we had previously sold to investors 
our whole loan sale agreements generally required us to repurchase loans if we breached a representation or warranty given to the loan purchaser 
in addition  we also could be required to repurchase loans as a result of borrower fraud or if a payment default occurs on a mortgage loan shortly after its sale 
the repurchase reserve is an estimate of losses from expected repurchases  and is based  in part  on the recent settlement of claims 
during the year ended december   the company paid approximately million to settle previous repurchase claims received by the discontinued operations 
the company s discontinued operations also continued to receive repurchase requests from fannie mae resulting in increases in estimated repurchase obligations 
at december   the repurchase reserve within discontinued operations was million as compared to million at december  additionally  the company has approximately thousand in repurchase reserves related to the loans sold by the continuing mortgage lending operations 
in connection with the discontinuation of our non conforming mortgage  warehouse lending and commercial operations  a significant amount of office space that was previously occupied is no longer being used by the company 
the company has subleased a significant amount of this office space 
at december   the company had a liability of million included within discontinued operations  representing the present value of the minimum lease payments over the remaining life of the lease  offset by the expected proceeds from sublet revenue related to this office space 
liquidity and capital resources our results of operations and liquidity are materially affected by conditions in the markets for mortgages and mortgage related assets  as well as the broader financial markets and the general economy 
concerns over economic recession  geopolitical issues  unemployment  the availability and cost of financing  the mortgage market and a declining real estate market contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and markets 
as a result of these conditions  the financial and mortgage industries suffered severe losses and several major market participants failed or have been impaired  resulting in a significant contraction in market liquidity 
this illiquidity negatively affected both the terms and availability of financing for all mortgage related assets 
due to this unprecedented volatility in the marketplace  it has become difficult to anticipate market conditions and therefore meet our liquidity objectives 
if these conditions persist  institutions from which we seek financing for our investments may tighten their lending standards or become insolvent  which could 
table of contents make it more difficult for us to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all 
additionally  our profitability may be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain cost effective financing 
we believe that current cash balances  cash flows from our mortgage lending operations  mortgage and real estate services fees generated from our long term mortgage portfolio  and residual interest cash flows from our long term mortgage portfolio are adequate for our current operating needs 
however  we believe the mortgage and real estate services market is volatile  highly competitive and subject to increased regulation 
competition in mortgage lending comes primarily from mortgage bankers  commercial banks  credit unions and other finance companies which have offices in our market area as well as operations throughout the united states 
we compete for loans principally on the basis of the interest rates and loan fees we charge  the types of loans we originate and the quality of services we provide to borrowers 
additionally  competition for loss mitigation servicing  loan modification services and other portfolio services has increased due to the unprecedented difficult mortgage environment and severe credit tightening  coupled with the stagnant economy 
this is evidenced by elevated levels of delinquencies and defaults  eroding real estate values and government mandated modification programs which have led to an increase in competitors who have recently entered or have established businesses delivering similar services 
our competitors include mega mortgage servicers  established subprime loan servicers  and newer entrants to the specialty servicing and recovery collections business 
efforts to market our ability to provide mortgage and real estate services for others is more difficult than many of our competitors because we have not historically provided such services to unrelated third parties  and we are not a rated primary or special servicer of residential mortgage loans as designated by a rating agency 
additionally  performance of the long term mortgage portfolio is subject to the continued deterioration in the real estate market and current economic conditions 
cash flows from our residual interests in securitizations are sensitive to delinquencies  defaults and credit losses associated with the securitized loans 
losses in excess of current estimates will reduce the residual interest cash receipts from our long term mortgage portfolio 
in response to the current market conditions  we have entered into lending relationships to improve our liquidity 
in april  we entered into a million working capital line of credit agreement which was subsequently increased to million in november see further details below under working capital line of credit 
additionally  in may  we entered into a million structured debt agreement using seven of the company s residual interests net trust assets as collateral see further details below under structured debt agreement 
while we continue to pay our obligations as they become due  the ability to continue to meet our current and long term obligations is dependent upon many factors  particularly the company s ability to successfully operate its mortgage and real estate business activities and realizing cash flows from the long term mortgage portfolio 
our future financial performance and success are dependent in large part upon the ability to expand our mortgage lending platform and grow the mortgage and real estate business activities  including providing services to third parties 
there can be no assurance of the company s ability to do so 
in addition  the company continues to evaluate strategies to improve liquidity including seeking debt and equity capital 
during  our operating businesses were primarily funded as follows cash flows from our mortgage and real estate fee based business activities  cash flows from mortgage lending operations  cash flows from our long term mortgage portfolio residual interests in securitizations  and cash flows from financing facilities and other lending relationships 

table of contents additionally  in september and october  we sold our interest in experience  inc  the parent of the title insurance company  for consideration totaling million  recording a total gain of approximately million 
the sale allowed the company to utilize approximately million of working capital previously set aside to support department of insurance net worth requirements for the title insurance company 
during  our operating businesses used available funds as follows origination and funding of mortgages  financing activities including interest and principal payments on debt  lease obligations  payroll obligations  operating expenses  and repurchase loans or settle repurchase claims 
sources of liquidity fees from our mortgage and real estate service business activities 
the company earns fees from various mortgage and real estate business activities  including loss mitigation  real estate disposition  monitoring and surveillance services  real estate brokerage and lending services 
the company provides services to investors  servicers and individual borrowers primarily by focusing on loss mitigation and performance of our long term mortgage portfolio 
cash flows from our mortgage lending operations 
we receive loan fees from loan originations 
fee income consists of application and underwriting fees and fees on cancelled loans 
these loan fees are offset by the related direct loan origination costs including broker fees 
in addition  we generally recognize net interest income on loans held for sale from the date of origination through the date of disposition 
in and continuing into  the borrowing rates on warehouse facilities exceeded loan note rates whereby the company is experiencing net interest expense from the loans held for sale due to the recent interest rate environment creating a flat yield curve 
we sell substantially all of the loans we originate in the secondary mortgage market  with servicing rights released or retained 
loans are sold on a whole loan basis by entering into sales transactions with third party investors in which we receive a premium for the loan and related servicing rights  if applicable 
the mortgage lending operations sold million of mortgages through whole loan sales during additionally  the mortgage lending operations enters into interest rate lock commitments irlcs and utilizes forward sold fannie mae and ginnie mae mortgage backed securities hedging instruments to hedge the fair value changes associated with changes in interest rates relating to its mortgage loan origination operations 
we may be subject to pair off fees associated with these hedging instruments 
since we rely significantly upon loan sales to generate cash proceeds to repay warehouse borrowings and to create credit availability  any disruption in our ability to complete sales may require us to utilize other sources of financing  which  if available at all  may be on less favorable terms 
in addition  delays in closing loan sales of our mortgages increase our risk by exposing us to credit and interest rate risk for this extended period of time 
cash flows from our long term mortgage portfolio residual interests in securitizations 
we receive residual cash flows on mortgages held as securitized mortgage collateral after distributions are made to investors on securitized mortgage borrowings to the extent required credit enhancements are maintained and performance covenants are complied with for credit ratings on the securitized mortgage borrowings 
these cash flows represent the difference between principal and interest payments on the underlying mortgages  affected by the following servicing and master servicing fees paid  
table of contents premiums paid to mortgage insurers  cash payments receipts on derivatives  interest paid on securitized mortgage borrowings  principal payments and prepayments paid on securitized mortgage borrowings  overcollateralization requirements  actual losses  net of any gains incurred upon disposition of other real estate owned or acquired in settlement of defaulted mortgages  unpaid interest shortfall  basis risk shortfall  and bond write downs reinstated 
certain residuals have been pledged as collateral for the note payable 
residual cash flows are used to make principal and interest payments see further details below under structured debt agreement 
additionally  the company acts as the master servicer for mortgages included in our cmo and remic securitizations 
the master servicing fees we earn are generally per annum basis points on the declining principal balances of these mortgages plus interest income on cash held in custodial accounts until remitted to investors  less any interest shortfall 
however  due to the decline in interest rates  the interest income earned on cash held in custodial accounts has declined significantly 
cash flows from financing facilities and other lending relationships 
we primarily fund our mortgage originations through warehouse facilities with third party lenders 
we primarily use facilities with regional banks 
during the warehouse facilities borrowing limits amounted to million  of which million was outstanding at december  the warehouse facilities are secured by and used to fund single family residential mortgage loans 
the warehouse facilities have certain covenant tests which we are required to satisfy 
at december   we were in compliance with all warehouse covenants 
in order to mitigate the liquidity risk associated with warehouse borrowings  we attempt to sell our mortgage loans within days from acquisition or origination 
in addition to the warehouse facilities  we have also entered into a line of credit and a note payable as discussed above 
the outstanding balance of the line of credit and note payable was million and million  respectively at december  at december  we were not in compliance with a capital expenditure limitation covenant on the working capital line of credit  however the company received a waiver 
our ability to meet liquidity requirements and the financing needs of our customers is subject to the renewal of our warehouse facilities or obtaining other sources of financing  if required  including additional debt or equity from time to time 
any decision our lenders or investors make to provide available financing to us in the future will depend upon a number of factors  including our compliance with the terms of existing warehouse lines and credit arrangements  including any financial covenants  the ability to obtain waivers upon any noncompliance  our financial performance  
table of contents industry and market trends in our various businesses  the general availability of  and rates applicable to  financing and investments  our lenders or investors resources and policies concerning loans and investments  and the relative attractiveness of alternative investment or lending opportunities 
uses of liquidity acquisition and origination of mortgage loans 
during  the mortgage lending operations originated or acquired million of mortgages 
capital invested in mortgages is outstanding until we sell the loans  which is one of the reasons we attempt to sell within days of acquisition or origination 
initial capital invested in mortgage loans includes premiums paid when mortgages are acquired and originated and our capital investment  or haircut  required upon financing  which is generally determined by the type of collateral provided and the warehouse facility terms 
the mortgage lending operations acquired and originated million of residential mortgages  which were financed with warehouse borrowings at a haircut generally between to of the outstanding principal balance of the mortgage loans 
financing activities structured debt agreement note payable 
in may  we entered into a million structured debt agreement note payable using seven of the company s residual interests net trust assets as collateral with the same note holder as the previous debt agreement 
the proceeds were used to pay off the million outstanding balance of the outstanding note payable previously entered in november the note payable bears interest at a fixed rate of per annum and is amortized in equal principal payments over months with all distributions from the underlying residual interests being used to make the monthly payments 
to the extent that cumulative cash flows received from the collateralized residual interests are not sufficient to pay the required monthly principal and interest  the company would be required to pay the difference to avoid the transfer of the residual interests and the rights to the associated future cash flows to the note holder 
any excess cash flows from the residual interests are included in a reserve account  which is available to cover future shortfalls 
during the year ended december   the company received million in excess cash flows from the residual interests collateralizing the note payable 
the million in excess cash flows is included in restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets 
if the amount of restricted cash becomes sufficient to satisfy the remaining obligation the note payable can be paid off and the residuals listed as security are released 
the carrying value of the note payable at december  was million  net of a thousand discount and was current as to principal and interest payments 
subsequent to december   the company entered into a new million structured debt agreement using eight of the company s residual interests net trust assets as collateral

repurchase reserve 
when we sell loans through whole loan sales we are required to make normal and customary representations and warranties about the loans to the purchaser 
our whole loan sale agreements generally require us to repurchase loans if we breach a representation or warranty given to the loan purchaser 
in addition  we may be required to repurchase loans as a result of borrower fraud or if a payment default occurs on a mortgage loan shortly after its sale 
investors have requested the company to repurchase loans or to indemnify them against losses on certain loans which the investors believe either do not comply with applicable representations or warranties or defaulted shortly after its purchase 
the company records an estimated reserve for these losses at the time the loan is sold  and adjusts the reserve to reflect the estimated loss 
the repurchase reserve associated with the mortgage lending operations within continuing operations totaled approximately thousand at december   compared to thousand at december  in determining the adequacy of the reserve for mortgage repurchases  management considers such factors as specific requests for repurchase  known problem loans  underlying collateral values  recent sales activity of similar loans  historical experience  current market conditions and other appropriate information 
during  the company recorded a provision for repurchase losses of thousand and is included in mortgage and real estate service fees in the consolidated statements of operations

inflation 
the consolidated financial statements and corresponding notes to the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased costs of our operations during and unlike industrial companies  nearly all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater effect on our performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
inflation affects our operations primarily through its effect on interest rates  since interest rates normally increase during periods of high inflation and decrease during periods of low inflation 
off balance sheet arrangements when we sell or broker loans through whole loan sales  we are required to make normal and customary representations and warranties to the loan originators or purchasers  including guarantees against early payment defaults typically days  and fraudulent misrepresentations by the borrowers 
our agreements generally require us to repurchase loans if we breach a representation or warranty given to the loan purchaser 
in addition  we may be required to repurchase loans as a result of borrower fraud or if a payment default occurs on a mortgage loan shortly after its sale 
because the loans are no longer on our balance sheet  the representations and warranties are considered a guarantee 
during  we sold million and brokered million of loans subject to representations and warranties compared to million and million in we maintained a million reserve related to these and other guarantees as of december  compared to a reserve of million as december  during we paid million to settle repurchase demands on loans previously sold to third parties as compared to million to settle or repurchase loans during see disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements under commitments and contingencies for other arrangements that qualify as off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies we define critical accounting policies as those that are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
our critical accounting policies require management to make difficult and complex judgments that rely on estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain due to the affect of changing market conditions and or consumer behavior 
in determining which accounting policies meet this definition  we considered our policies with respect to the valuation of our assets and liabilities and estimates and assumptions used in determining those valuations 
we believe the most critical accounting issues that require the most complex and difficult judgments and

fair value of financial instruments financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification fasb asc defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and outlines a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date also referred to as an exit price 
fair value measurements are categorized into a three level hierarchy based on the extent to which the measurement relies on observable market inputs in measuring fair value 
level  which is the highest priority in the fair value hierarchy  is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level is based on observable market based inputs  other than quoted prices  in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level  which is the lowest priority in the fair value hierarchy  is based on unobservable inputs 
assets and liabilities are classified within this hierarchy in their entirety based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
the use of fair value to measure our financial instruments is fundamental to our financial statements and is a critical accounting estimate because a substantial portion of our assets and liabilities are recorded at estimated fair value 
financial instruments classified as level are generally based on unobservable inputs  and the process to determine fair value is generally more subjective and involves a high degree of management judgment and assumptions 
these assumptions may have a significant effect on our estimates of fair value  and the use of different assumptions  as well as changes in market conditions and interest rates  could have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
as a result of the lack of observable market data resulting from inactive markets  the company has classified its investment securities available for sale  securitized mortgage collateral and borrowings  net derivative liabilities  long term debt  mortgage servicing rights  and call and put options as level fair value measurements 
level assets and liabilities were and  respectively  of total assets and total liabilities measured at estimated fair value at december  and for a detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial instruments  see note fair value of financial instruments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
variable interest entities and transfers of financial assets and liabilities historically  the company securitized mortgages in the form of collateralized mortgage obligations cmo  which were consolidated and accounted for as secured borrowings for financial statement purposes 
the company also securitized mortgages in the form of real estate mortgage investment conduits remics  which were either consolidated or unconsolidated depending on the 
table of contents design of the securitization structure 
cmo and certain remic securitizations were designed so that the transferee securitization trust was not a qualifying special purpose entity qspe  and therefore the company consolidated the variable interest entity vie as it was the primary beneficiary of the sole residual interest in each securitization trust 
generally  this was achieved by including terms in the securitization agreements that gave the company the ability to unilaterally cause the securitization trust to return specific mortgages  other than through a clean up call 
amounts consolidated are included in trust assets and liabilities as securitized mortgage collateral  real estate owned  derivative assets  securitized mortgage borrowings and derivative liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
our estimate of the fair value of our net retained residual interests in unconsolidated securitizations  which are included in investment securities available for sale in the consolidated balance sheets  requires us to exercise significant judgment as to the timing and amount of future cash flows from the residual interests 
we are exposed to credit risk from the underlying mortgage loans in unconsolidated securitizations to the extent we retain subordinated interests 
changes in expected cash flows resulting from changes in expected net credit losses will impact the value of our subordinated retained interests and those changes are recorded as a component of change in fair value of net trust assets in contrast  for securitizations that are structured as secured borrowing  we recognize interest income over the life of the securitized mortgage collateral and interest expense incurred for the securitized mortgage borrowings 
we refer to these transactions as consolidated securitizations 
the mortgage loans collateralizing the debt securities for these financings are included in securitized mortgage collateral and the debt securities payable to investors in these securitizations are included in securitized mortgage borrowings in our consolidated balance sheet 
whether a securitization is consolidated or unconsolidated  investors in the securities issued by the securitization trust have no recourse to our non securitized assets or to us and have no ability to require us to provide additional assets  but rather have recourse only to the assets transferred to the trust 
whereas the accounting differences are significant  the underlying economic impact to us  over time  will be the same regardless of whether the securitization trust is consolidated or unconsolidated 
effective january   former qspes are evaluated for consolidation based on the provisions of fasb asc  which eliminates the concept of a qspe and changes the approach to determining a securitization trust s primary beneficiary 
refer to note financial statement presentation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impact the new rules had on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
net realizable value of reo the company considers the nrv of its reo properties in evaluating reo losses 
when real estate is acquired in settlement of loans  or other real estate owned  the mortgage is written down to a percentage of the property s appraised value  broker s price opinion or list price less estimated selling costs and including mortgage insurance proceeds expected to be received 
subsequent changes in the nrv of the reo is reflected as a write down of reo and results in additional losses

table of contents income 
in accordance with fasb asc  financial instruments  loan origination fees and expenses are recognized in earnings as incurred and not deferred 
lhfs remaining from the company s discontinued residential and commercial lending operations are recorded at the lower of cost or market and are included in assets of discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
repurchase reserve when we sell loans through whole loan sales we are required to make normal and customary representations and warranties about the loans to the purchaser 
our whole loan sale agreements generally require us to repurchase loans if we breach a representation or warranty given to the loan purchaser 
in addition  we may be required to repurchase loans as a result of borrower fraud or if a payment default occurs on a mortgage loan shortly after its sale 
investors may request the company to repurchase loans or to indemnify them against losses on certain loans which the investors believe either do not comply with applicable representations or warranties or defaulted shortly after its purchase 
upon completion of its own investigation regarding the investor claims  the company repurchases or provides indemnification on certain loans  as appropriate 
the company maintains a liability for expected losses on dispositions of loans expected to be repurchased or on which indemnification is expected to be provided and regularly evaluates the adequacy of this repurchase liability based on trends in repurchase and indemnification requests  actual loss experience  settlement negotiations  and other relevant factors including economic conditions 
the company estimates the repurchase reserve based on the estimated trailing whole loan sales that still have outstanding early payment and misrepresentation warranties 
the calculation of the trailing whole loan sales subject to request is based upon historical analysis of the timing of requests in relation to their sale date 
the company also calculates the rate at which our whole loan sales will develop into early payment default or misrepresentation claims 
based on historical experience  management will determine what percentage of the claims may incur a loss 
the company applies a historical loss rate  adjusted for current market conditions based on the type of loan first lien or to a lesser extent second lien to the loans we expect to incur loss on in the future to derive the repurchase reserve 
the reserve includes the company s estimate of losses in the fair value of loans the company expects it will repurchase  plus any premiums that will be refunded to the investor 
the loss in fair value is predominately determined based on several factors including recent settlements and status of current settlement negotiations 
interest income and interest expense interest income on securitized mortgage collateral and interest expense on securitized mortgage borrowings are recorded using the effective yield for the period based on the previous quarter end s estimated fair value 
income taxes the company is subject to federal income taxes as a regular subchapter c corporation and files a consolidated us federal income tax return 
we have significant nol carryforwards from prior years 
we do not expect to be able to generate sufficient taxable income in future years to utilize these losses and have recognized a full valuation allowance against these nol carryforwards in our consolidated balance sheets

securitized mortgage collateral declined million during the year ended december   primarily due to reductions in principal from borrower payments  transfers of loans to reo and an increase in net loss assumptions for single family collateral 
additionally the million reduction in other trust assets during the year ended december  was primarily due to reo liquidations of million and additional impairment write downs of million 
partially offsetting the decrease from liquidations were increases in reo from foreclosures of million 
securitized mortgage borrowings declined million during the year ended december   primarily due to reductions in principal balances from principal payments during the period and an increase in net loss assumptions for single family collateral 
the million dollar reduction in other trust liabilities during the year ended december  was primarily due to million in derivative cash payments from the securitization trusts  partially offset by an million increase in derivative fair value resulting from changes in forward libor interest rates

since our consolidated and unconsolidated securitization trusts are nonrecourse to the company  our economic risk is limited to our residual interests in these securitization trusts 
therefore  in the following table we have netted trust assets and trust liabilities to present these residual interests more simply 
our residual interests in securitizations are segregated between our single family sf residential and multifamily mf residential portfolios and are represented by the difference between trust assets and trust liabilities

the estimated fair values of residual interests in vintage years through is reflective of higher estimated future losses and investor yield requirements compared to earlier vintage years 
the company utilizes a number of assumptions to value securitized mortgage collateral  securitized mortgage borrowings and residual interests 
these assumptions include estimated collateral default rates and loss severities credit losses  collateral prepayment rates  forward interest rates and investor yields discount rates 
the company uses the same collateral assumptions for securitized mortgage collateral and securitized mortgage borrowings as the collateral assumptions determine collateral cash flows which are used to pay interest and principal for securitized mortgage borrowings and excess spread  if any  to the residual interests 
however  the company uses different investor yield discount rate assumptions for securitized mortgage collateral and securitized mortgage borrowings and the discount rate used for residual interests based on underlying collateral characteristics  vintage year  assumed risk and market participant assumptions

as illustrated in s ps case shiller city composite home price index  from through  home price appreciation escalated to historic levels 
during through  the company originated or acquired mortgages supported by these elevated real estate values 
beginning in  deterioration in the economy resulting in high unemployment and a dramatic drop in home prices resulted in significant negative equity for borrowers 
these factors have led to significant increases in loss severities resulting from deterioration in the credit quality of borrowers  as well as strategic defaults  whereby borrowers with the ability to pay are defaulting on their mortgages based on the belief that home prices will not recover in a reasonable amount of time 
home prices have deteriorated back to december levels which has significantly reduced or eliminated equity for loans originated after future loss estimates are significantly higher for mortgage loans included in securitization vintages after which reflect severe home price deterioration and defaults experienced with mortgages originated during these periods 
the mortgage lending operations are affected by the following market and operational risks interest rate risk  and liquidity risk 
interest rate risk mortgage lending 
the company is exposed to interest rate risks relating to its ongoing mortgage lending operations 
the company uses derivative instruments to manage some of its interest rate risk 
however  the company does not attempt to hedge interest rate risk completely 
the company enters into interest rate lock commitments and commitments to sell mortgages to help mitigate some of the exposure to the effect of changing interest rates on mortgage lending cash flows 
interest rate lock commitments expose the company to interest rate risk 
the mortgage lending operations currently utilizes forward sold fannie mae and ginnie mae mortgage backed securities to hedge the fair value changes associated with changes in interest rates relating to its mortgage loan origination operations 
liquidity risk 
the company is exposed to liquidity risks relating to its ongoing mortgage lending operations 
we primarily fund our mortgage lending originations through warehouse facilities with third party lenders 
we primarily use facilities with regional banks 
the warehouse facilities are secured by and used to fund single family residential mortgage loans 
in order to mitigate the liquidity risk associated 
table of contents with warehouse borrowings  we attempt to sell our mortgage loans within days from acquisition or origination 
cash flows from the company s long term mortgage portfolio are affected by the following market and operational risks interest rate risk  credit risk  and prepayment risk 
interest rate risk securitized trusts  long term debt 
the company s earnings from the long term mortgage portfolio depend largely on our interest rate spread  represented by the relationship between the yield on our interest earning assets primarily investment securities available for sale and securitized mortgage collateral and the cost of our interest bearing liabilities primarily securitized mortgage borrowings and long term debt 
our interest rate spread is impacted by several factors  including general economic factors  forward interest rates and the credit quality of mortgage loans in the long term mortgage portfolio 
the residual interests in our long term mortgage portfolio are sensitive to changes in interest rates on securitized mortgage collateral and the related securitized mortgage borrowings 
changes in interest rates can significantly affect the cash flows and fair values of the company s assets and liabilities  as well as our earnings and stockholders equity 
the company uses derivative instruments to manage some of its interest rate risk in its long term mortgage portfolio 
however  the company does not attempt to hedge interest rate risk completely 
to help mitigate some of the exposure to the effect of changing interest rates on cash flows on securitized mortgage borrowings  the company utilized derivative instruments primarily in the form of interest rate swap agreements swaps and  to a lesser extent  interest rate cap agreements caps and interest rate floor agreements floors 
these derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets 
for non exchange traded contracts  fair value is based on the amounts that would be required to settle the positions with the related counterparties as of the valuation date 
valuations of derivative assets and liabilities are based on observable market inputs  if available 
to the extent observable market inputs are not available  fair values measurements include the company s judgments about future cash flows  forward interest rates and certain other factors  including counterparty risk 
additionally  these values also take into account the company s own credit standing  to the extent applicable  thus  the valuation of the derivative instrument includes the estimated value of the net credit differential between the counterparties to the derivative contract 
at december   derivative liabilities  net were million and reflect the securitization trust s liability to pay third party counterparties based on the estimated value to settle the derivative instruments 
cash payments on these derivative instruments are based on notional amounts that are decreasing over time 
excluding the effects of other factors such as portfolio delinquency and loss severities within the securitization trusts  as the notional amount of these derivative instruments decrease over time  payments to counterparties in the current interest rate environment are reduced  thereby potentially increasing cash flows on our residual interests in securitizations 
conversely  increases in interest rates from current levels could potentially reduce overall cash flows on our residual interests in securitizations 
since our consolidated and unconsolidated securitization trusts are nonrecourse to the company  our economic risk is limited to our residual interests in these securitization trusts 

table of contents the company is also subject to interest rate risk on its long term debt consisting of trust preferred securities and junior subordinated notes 
these interest bearing liabilities include adjustable rate periods based on three month libor trust preferred securities and junior subordinated notes 
the company does not currently hedge its exposure to the effect of changing interest rates related to these interest bearing liabilities 
significant fluctuations in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
credit risk securitized trusts 
we manage credit risk by actively managing delinquencies and defaults through our servicers 
starting with the second half of we have not retained any additional alt a mortgages in our long term mortgage portfolio 
our securitized mortgage collateral primarily consists of alt a mortgages which when originated were generally within typical fannie mae and freddie mac guidelines but had loan characteristics  which may have included higher loan balances  higher loan to value ratios or lower documentation requirements including stated income loans  that made them non conforming under those guidelines 
using historical losses  current portfolio statistics and market conditions and available market data  the company has estimated future loan losses on the long term mortgage portfolio  which are included in the fair value adjustment to our securitized mortgage collateral 
while the credit performance for the loans has been clearly far worse than the company s initial expectations when the loans were originated  the ultimate level of realized losses will largely be influenced by events that will likely unfold over the next several years  including the severity of housing price declines and overall strength of the economy 
if market conditions continue to deteriorate in excess of our expectations  the company may need to recognize additional fair value reductions to our securitized mortgage collateral  which may also affect the value of the related securitized mortgage borrowings and residual interests 
we monitor our servicers to attempt to ensure that they perform loss mitigation  foreclosure and collection functions according to their servicing practices and each securitization trust s pooling and servicing agreement 
we have met with the management of our servicers to assess our borrowers current ability to pay their mortgages and to make arrangements with selected delinquent borrowers which will result in the best interest of the trust and borrower  in an effort to minimize the number of mortgages which become seriously delinquent 
when resolving delinquent mortgages  servicers are required to take timely action 
the servicer is required to determine payment collection under various circumstances  which will result in the maximum financial benefit 
this is accomplished by either working with the borrower to bring the mortgage current by modifying the loan with terms that will maximize the recovery or by foreclosing and liquidating the property 
at a foreclosure sale  the trusts consolidated on our balance sheet generally acquire title to the property 
we use the mortgage bankers association mba method to define delinquency as a contractually required payment being or more days past due

it is our policy to place a mortgage on non accrual status when it becomes days delinquent and to reverse from revenue any accrued interest  except for interest income on securitized mortgage collateral when the scheduled payment is received from the servicer 
the servicers are required to advance principal and interest on loans within the securitization trusts to the extent the advances are considered recoverable

adjustments to the loan carrying value required at the time of foreclosure are included in the change in the fair value of net trust assets 
changes in the company s estimates of net realizable value subsequent to the time of foreclosure and through the time of ultimate disposition are recorded as gains or losses from real estate owned in the consolidated statements of operations

this reo is included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
in calculating the cash flows to assess the fair value of the securitized mortgage collateral  the company estimates the future losses embedded in our loan portfolio 
in evaluating the adequacy of these losses  management takes many factors into consideration 
for instance  a detailed analysis of historical loan performance data is accumulated and reviewed 
this data is analyzed for loss performance and prepayment performance by product type  origination year and securitization issuance 
the data is also broken down by collection status 
our estimate of losses for these loans is developed by estimating both the rate of default of the loans and the amount of loss severity in the event of default 
the rate of default is assigned to the loans based on their attributes eg  original loan to value  borrower credit score  documentation type  geographic location  etc 
and collection status 
the rate of default is based on analysis of migration of loans from each aging category 
the loss 
table of contents severity is determined by estimating the net proceeds from the ultimate sale of the foreclosed property 
the results of that analysis are then applied to the current mortgage portfolio and an estimate is created 
we believe that pooling of mortgages with similar characteristics is an appropriate methodology in which to evaluate the future loan losses 
management recognizes that there are qualitative factors that must be taken into consideration when evaluating and measuring losses in the loan portfolios 
these items include  but are not limited to  economic indicators that may affect the borrower s ability to pay  changes in value of collateral  political factors  employment and market conditions  competitor s performance  market perception  historical losses  and industry statistics 
the assessment for losses  is based on delinquency trends and prior loss experience and management s judgment and assumptions regarding various matters  including general economic conditions and loan portfolio composition 
management continually evaluates these assumptions and various relevant factors affecting credit quality and inherent losses 
prepayment risk 
the company historically used prepayment penalties as a method of partially mitigating prepayment risk for those borrowers that have the ability to refinance 
the recent economic downturn  lack of available credit and declines in property values have limited borrowers ability to refinance 
these factors have significantly reduced prepayment risk within our long term mortgage portfolio 
with the seasoning of the long term mortgage portfolio  a significant portion of prepayment penalties terms have expired  thereby further reducing prepayment penalty income

in connection with the fair value accounting for investment securities available for sale and securitized mortgage collateral and borrowings  interest income and interest expense is recognized using effective yields based on estimated fair values for these instruments 
the decrease in yield for securitized mortgage collateral and securitized mortgage borrowings is primarily related to increased prices on mortgage backed bonds which resulted in a decrease in yield 
bond prices received from pricing services and other market participants have increased during the year as investor s demand for mortgage backed securities has increased 
this has resulted in an increase in fair value for both securitized mortgage collateral and securitized mortgage borrowings 
these increases in fair value have decreased the effective yields used for purposes of recognizing interest income and interest expense on these instruments
