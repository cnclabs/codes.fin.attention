table of contents general the following management dis cussion and analysis provides a narrative of the results of operations and financial condition of ilg for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in this form k for the year ended december   which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
this discussion includes the following sections management overview critical accounting policies and estimates results of operations financial position  liquidity and capital resources ilg s principles of financial reporting reconciliation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda management overview history ilg was incorporated as a delaware corporation in may in connection with a plan by iac interactivecorp  or iac  to separate into five publicly traded companies  referred to as the spin off 
in connection with the spin off  we entered into an indenture pursuant to which we issued million of senior unsecured notes due and entered into a senior secured credit facility with a maturity in  including a term loan in the original principal amount of million and a million revolving credit facility 
ilg was formed to hold the membership and exchange and management and rental businesses  and commenced trading on the nasdaq stock market in august under the symbol iilg 
the membership and exchange segment consists of interval international inc s businesses  referred to as interval  and tpi s membership and exchange related line of business 
the management and rental segment consists of aston hotels resorts  llc and maui condo and home  llc  referred to as aston  and tpi s management and rental related line of business 
on february   we acquired vacation resorts international which will primarily be part of the management and rental segment 
basis of presentation and accounting estimates the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap and reflect the financial position and operating results of ilg 
ilg s management is required to make certain estimates and assumptions during the preparation of its consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap 
these estimates and assumptions impact the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements 
they also impact the reported amount of net earnings during any period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant estimates underlying the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the recovery of goodwill and long lived and other intangible assets  purchase price allocations  the determination of deferred income taxes including related valuation allowances  the determination of deferred revenue and membership costs  and the determination of stock based compensation 
in the opinion of ilg s management  the assumptions underlying the historical consolidated financial statements of ilg and its subsidiaries are reasonable 

table of contents general description of our business ilg is a leading global provider of membership and leisure services to the vacation industry 
we operate in two business segments membership and exchange and management and rental 
our principal business segment  membership and exchange  offers travel and leisure related products and services to owners of vacation interests and others primarily through various membership programs  as well as related services to resort developer clients 
management and rental  our other business segment  provides hotel  resort and homeowners association management and vacation rental services to both vacation property owners and vacationers 
membership and exchange services interval  the principal business comprising our membership and exchange segment  has been a leader in the membership and exchange services industry since its founding in as of december   interval s primary operation is the interval network  a quality global vacation ownership membership exchange network with a large and diversified base of participating resorts consisting of more than  resorts located in over countries  including both leading independent resort developers and branded hospitality companies  and approximately million vacation ownership interest owners enrolled as members of the interval network 
interval typically enters into multi year contracts with developers of vacation ownership resorts  pursuant to which the resort developers agree to enroll all purchasers of vacation interests at the applicable resort as members of an interval exchange program 
in return  interval provides enrolled purchasers with the ability to exchange the use and occupancy of their vacation interest at the home resort generally for a period of one week for the right to occupy accommodations at a different resort participating in an interval exchange network 
through interval s getaways  members may rent resort accommodations for a fee without relinquishing the use of their vacation interest 
in addition  interval offers sales  marketing and operational support  consulting and back office services  including reservation servicing  to certain resort developers participating in the interval network  upon their request and for additional consideration 
the membership and exchange segment earns most of its revenue from i fees paid for membership in the interval network and ii interval network transactional and service fees paid primarily for exchanges  getaways  reservation servicing  and related transactions collectively referred to as transaction revenue 
management and rental services we also provide management and rental services to hotels as well as condominium and timeshare resorts and their homeowners associations through aston and tpi 
such vacation properties and hotels are not owned by us 
aston is based in hawaii and concentrates largely on hotel and condominium resort management primarily in hawaii  as well as vacation property rental and related services including common area and owner association management services for condominium projects 
tpi provides vacation rentals and timeshare resort and homeowners association management services in the united states  canada and mexico 
on february   we acquired vacation resorts international  the largest independent provider of resort and homeowners association management services to the shared ownership industry 
as of december   the businesses that comprise our management and rental segment provided management and rental services at over vacation properties and hotels as well as more limited management services to certain additional properties 

table of contents revenue from the management and rental segment is derived principally from fees for hotel  condominium resort  timeshare resort and homeowners association management and rental services 
management fees consist of a base management fee and  in some instances for hotels or condominium resorts  an incentive management fee which is generally a percentage of operating profits or improvement in operating profits 
service fee revenue is based on the services provided to owners including reservations  sales and marketing  property accounting and information technology services either internally or through third party providers 
a majority of aston s hotel and condominium resort management agreements provide that owners receive either specified percentages of the revenue generated under our management or guaranteed dollar amounts 
in these cases  the operating expenses for the rental operation are paid from the revenue generated by the rentals  the owners are then paid their contractual percentages or amounts  and the management and rental segment either retains the balance if any as its management fee or makes up the deficit 
international operations international revenue increased in compared to and decreased in compared to as a percentage of our total revenue  international revenue decreased to in  from in  and from in other factors affecting results membership and exchange the reduction in sales and marketing expenditures by resort developers spurred by the lack of receivables financing has resulted in a decrease in the flow of new members to our exchange networks 
beginning in  access to the credit markets returned for securitization transactions available to certain large developers  and during  access to receivables financing has improved 
financing standards for consumers remain higher than those required several years ago and developers are continuing to modify their business models 
as developers with greater debt loads continue to work with their lenders  we anticipate additional bankruptcies  reorganizations and consolidation within the industry  although to a lesser extent than the last several years 
in addition  our results were negatively affected  particularly in the first half of the year  by a shift in the mix and availability of exchange and getaway inventory and changes in travel patterns 
the dynamics of the changing travel patterns and inventory availability  along with fewer absolute members  resulted in softness in bookings and an increase in the cost and volume of purchased inventory 
management and rental our management and rental segment results are susceptible to variations in economic conditions  particularly in its primary market  hawaii 
according to the hawaii tourism authority  visitor arrivals by air in hawaii have increased in compared to the increase in visitors is consistent with aston s managed properties in hawaii experiencing increases in occupancy  partly related to a decrease in available room nights  leading to an overall increase of in revenue per available room revpar in hawaii in compared to for compared to  the increase in revpar in hawaii was predominantly driven by higher average daily rate 
as of the latest forecast february  the hawaii state department of business  economic development tourism  forecasts increases of in visitors to hawaii and in visitor expenditures in over 
table of contents business acquisition on november   we acquired tpi which offers exchange and leisure services to vacation owners  including management at over resorts located throughout north america 
tpi was consolidated into our financial statements as of the acquisition date and the financial effect of this acquisition was not material to our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december   however  such affects the year over year comparability for the year ended december  outlook throughout  the vacation ownership industry has remained in a period of transition that may result in the bankruptcy  restructuring and consolidation of developers as well as continued modifications to their business models 
although we see a slight improvement in the economic environment and developer optimism  we anticipate this period of transition to continue into for the management and rental business  we expect aston s revpar to continue to show year over year improvement  however  increases in airfare resulting from decreased airlift into hawaii  consolidation of airline carriers and the rising cost of jet fuel may negatively impact visitor arrivals from the mainland and temper growth 
additionally  on february   we acquired vacation resorts international vri  the largest independent provider of resort and homeowners association management services to the shared ownership industry 
vri will be consolidated into our financial statements as of the acquisition date and its results of operations primarily included within our management and rental segment thereafter 
lastly  the owner of one of aston s largest managed properties has been unable to repay or refinance the mortgage that matured on october  the owner has since received a notice of default and a foreclosure action was filed in february in the event that the owner is unable to obtain new financing  has a receiver or trustee appointed  reorganizes or liquidates under bankruptcy protection or the lender acquires direct or indirect possession of the property  aston s management agreement may be terminated or modified which could materially adversely affect the aston business and the financial condition and results of operations of our management and rental segment 
the loss or adverse modification of this management agreement may require us to test the goodwill and other intangible assets of this reporting unit for impairment  which could result in recording an impairment charge at that time 
we will continue to monitor this developing situation and assess potential future impairment of long lived assets and goodwill and other intangible assets  in accordance with applicable accounting standards 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates which are based on historical experience and on various other judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual outcomes could differ from those estimates 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note  significant accounting policies  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and should be reviewed in connection with the following discussion 
set forth below are the policies and estimates that we have identified as critical to our business operations and an understanding of our results of operations  based on the high degree of judgment or complexity in their application 

table of contents revenue recognition revenue  net of sales incentives  from membership fees from our membership and exchange segment is deferred and recognized over the terms of the applicable memberships  typically ranging from one to five years  on a straight line basis 
when multiple member benefits and services are provided over the term of the membership  revenue is recognized for each separable deliverable ratably over the membership period  as applicable 
generally  memberships are cancelable and refundable on a pro rata basis  with the exception of our platinum tier 
direct costs of acquiring members primarily commissions and certain fulfillment costs related to deferred membership revenue are also deferred and amortized on a straight line basis over the terms of the applicable memberships or benefit period  whichever is shorter 
the recognition of previously deferred revenue and expense is based on estimates derived from an aggregation of member level data 
revenue from exchange and getaway transactions is recognized when confirmation of the transaction is provided as the earnings process is complete 
reservation servicing revenue is recognized when service is performed or on a straight line basis over the applicable service period 
all taxable revenue transactions are presented on a net of tax basis 
the management and rental segment s revenue is derived principally from fees for hotel  condominium resort  timeshare resort and homeowners association management and rental services 
management fees consist of base management fees  which are either fixed amounts or range from to of adjusted gross lodging revenue  various revenue sharing arrangements with condominium owners based on stated formulas or a percentage of adjusted gross lodging revenue  and incentive management fees for certain hotels and condominium resorts which are generally a percentage of operating profits or improvement in operating profits 
service fee revenue is based on the services provided to owners including reservations  sales and marketing  property accounting and information technology services either internally or through third party providers 
service fee revenue is recognized when the service is provided 
in certain instances we arrange services which are provided directly to property owners 
transactions for these services do not impact our consolidated financial statements as they are not included in our results of operations 
additionally  in most cases  we employ on site personnel to provide services such as housekeeping  maintenance and administration to property owners and homeowner associations under our management agreements 
for such services  we recognize revenue in an amount equal to the expenses incurred 
additionally  when we enter into multiple element arrangements  we are required to determine whether the deliverables in these arrangements should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes and  if so  how the contract price should be allocated to each element 
we analyze our contracts upon execution to determine the appropriate revenue recognition accounting treatment 
our determination of whether to recognize revenue for separate deliverables will depend on the terms and specifics of our products and arrangements as well as the nature of changes to our existing products and services  if any 
the allocation of contract revenue to the various elements does not change the total revenue recognized from a transaction or arrangement  but may impact the timing of revenue recognition 
accounting for business combinations in accordance with asc topic  business combinations  when accounting for business combinations we are required to recognize the assets acquired  liabilities assumed  contractual contingencies  and contingent consideration at their fair value as of the acquisition date 
the purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions with respect to intangible assets  estimated contingent consideration payments and or pre acquisition contingencies  all of which ultimately affect the fair value of goodwill established as of the acquisition date 
goodwill acquired in business combinations is assigned to the reporting unit s expected to benefit from the combination as of the acquisition date and is then subsequently tested for impairment at least annually 

table of contents although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made have been reasonable and appropriate  they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired entity and are inherently uncertain 
examples of critical estimates in accounting for acquisitions include but are not limited to the estimated fair value of the acquisition related contingent consideration  which is performed using a probability weighted income approach based upon the forecasted achievement of post acquisition pre determined targets  the future expected cash flows from sales of products and services and related contracts and agreements  and discount and long term growth rates 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy or validity of our assumptions  estimates or actual results 
additionally  any change in the fair value of the acquisition related contingent consideration subsequent to the acquisition date  including changes resulting from events that occur after the acquisition date  such as changes in our estimated fair value of the targets that are expected to be achieved  will be recognized in earnings in the period of the change in estimated fair value 
recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets our policy goodwill and other intangible assets are significant components of our consolidated balance sheets 
our policies regarding the valuation of intangible assets affect the amount of future amortization and possible impairment charges we may incur 
assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible and other long lived assets are complex and subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as consumer spending habits and general economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
in accordance with asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other  we review the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets of each of our reporting units on an annual basis as of october  or more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances  based on a two step impairment test 
we consider our membership and exchange and management and rental segments to be individual reporting units which are also individual operating segments of ilg 
goodwill acquired in business combinations is assigned to the reporting unit s expected to benefit from the combination as of the acquisition date 
the first step of the impairment test compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill 
the fair value of each reporting unit is calculated using the average of an income approach and a market comparison approach which utilizes similar companies as the basis for the valuation 
if the carrying amount exceeds fair value  then the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of any impairment loss 
the impairment loss is determined by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying value of goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over amounts assigned to its net assets 
the determination of fair value utilizes an evaluation of historical and forecasted operating results and other estimates 
fair value measurements are generally determined through the use of valuation techniques that may include a discounted cash flow approach  which reflects our own assumptions of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 

table of contents during the year  we monitor the actual performance of our reporting units relative to the fair value assumptions used in our annual goodwill impairment test  including potential events and changes in circumstance affecting our key estimates and assumptions 
annual impairment test as of october   we reviewed the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets of each of our two reporting units 
goodwill assigned to the membership and exchange and management and rental reporting units as of this date was million and million  respectively 
we performed the first step of the impairment test on both our reporting units and concluded that each reporting unit s fair value exceeded its carrying value and  therefore  the second step of the impairment test was not necessary 
as of december   we did not identify any triggering events which required an interim impairment test subsequent to our annual impairment test on october  key estimates and assumptions the determination of fair value utilizes an evaluation of historical and forecasted operating results and other key assumptions made by management  including discount rates  utilized in the valuation of certain identifiable assets 
deterioration in macroeconomic conditions or in our results of operations or unforeseen negative events could adversely affect either of our reporting units and lead to a revision of the estimates used to calculate fair value 
these key estimates and forecasted operating results may or may not occur or may be revised by management which may require us to recognize impairment losses in the future 
with respect to our membership and exchange reporting unit s step one analysis  the primary examples of key estimates include our discount rate and forecasted sales growth rates 
as previously noted  we use the average of an income approach and a market comparison approach to calculate the fair value of our reporting units 
as a measure of sensitivity on the income approach  as of the date of our last annual impairment test  a hypothetical change in both our discount and long term growth rates would result in a change of million in the income approach fair value of the reporting unit  or approximately of the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over its carrying value 
in regards to the market comparison approach  a change in our selected ebitda multiple by would result in a change of approximately million in the membership and exchange reporting unit s market comparison approach fair value  or approximately of the excess of the reporting unit s fair value over its carrying value 
with respect to our management and rental reporting unit s step one analysis  the primary examples of key estimates include forecasted available and occupied room nights  average daily rates and long term growth rates 
as a measure of sensitivity on the income approach  as of the date of our last annual impairment test  a hypothetical change to all four forecasted key estimates would result in a change of approximately million in our management and rental s income approach fair value  or approximately of the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over its carrying value 
in regards to the market comparison approach  a change in our selected ebitda multiple by would result in a change of approximately million in the reporting unit s market comparison approach fair value  or approximately of the excess of the reporting unit s fair value over its carrying value 

table of contents key estimates and assumptions for both our reporting units can be impacted by certain potential events and changes in circumstances  as follows events and trends in the vacation ownership  vacation rental and travel industries that could adversely affect consumers travel to and vacation in certain destinations and regions in which vacation rental and managed properties are located  including events such as declines in discretionary spending levels during general economic downturns 
inclement weather and or natural disasters 
travel health concerns 
concerns related to terrorism  enhanced travel security measures and or geographical conflicts 
additionally  key estimates and assumptions for both our reporting units can be impacted by certain potential events and changes in circumstances specific to each reporting unit  such as membership and exchange a downturn or a weakening of the economy may cause decreased demand for purchases of vacation ownership interests  may increase default rates among current owners and may increase refund requests from our members 
lack of available financing for vacation property developers and consumers or the potential insolvency or consolidation of developers could adversely affect our ability to maintain and grow our exchange network membership which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to maintain relationships and renew contractual relationships with vacation ownership developers that provide new members and supply of resort accommodations for use in exchanges or getaways 
our ability to motivate members to renew their existing memberships and or otherwise engage in transactions 
management and rental a downturn or a weakening of the economy may cause decreased demand for vacation rentals 
the failure to maintain existing hotel  condominium resort and timeshare resort management and or rental services arrangements with vacation property owners homeowners associations  and or insolvency of several properties managed by or marketed by the management and rental segment  particularly managed hotels 
a significant decrease in the supply of available vacation rental accommodations due to ongoing property renovations 
inability of our managed homeowners associations to levy and collect sufficient maintenance fees to cover the costs to operate and maintain the resort properties  such properties may be forced to close or file bankruptcy and may terminate our management 
recoverability of long lived assets our policy we review the carrying value of all long lived assets  primarily property and equipment and definite lived intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate 
table of contents that the carrying value of a long lived asset asset group may be impaired 
in accordance with guidance included within asc topic  property  plant and equipment  recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset asset group to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset asset group 
an asset group is the lowest level of assets and liabilities for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
when estimating future cash flows  we consider only the future cash flows that were directly associated with and that are expected to arise as a direct result of the use and eventual disposition of the asset group  our own assumptions about our use of the asset group and all available evidence when estimating future cash flows  potential events and changes in circumstance affecting our key estimates and assumptions  the existing service potential of the asset asset group at the date tested 
if an asset asset group is considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset asset group exceeds its fair value 
when determining the fair value of the asset asset group  we consider the highest and best use of the assets from a market participant perspective 
the fair value measurement is generally determined through the use of independent third party appraisals or an expected present value technique  both of which may include a discounted cash flow approach  which reflects our own assumptions of what market participants would utilize to price the asset asset group 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
assets to be abandoned  or from which no further benefit is expected  are written down to zero at the time that the determination is made and the assets are removed entirely from service 
recoverability test the last recoverability test performed was as of march  on an asset group within our management and rental reporting unit as a consequence of that reporting unit failing step one of the two step process for testing goodwill for impairment 
as more fully discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements  the resulting recoverability test concluded the asset group was not considered to be impaired 
from that date through december   we have not identified any events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of a long lived asset asset group may be impaired  accordingly  a recoverability test has not been warranted 
stock based compensation stock based compensation is accounted for under asc topic  compensation stock compensation asc 
compensation cost for stock awards is measured at fair value on date of grant and recognized over the service period for awards expected to vest 
the fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units rsus is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock on that date 
we grant awards subject to graded vesting ie portions of the award vest at different times during the vesting period or to cliff vesting ie all awards vest at the end of the vesting period 
certain rsus  in addition  are subject to attaining specific performance criteria 
for rsus to be settled in stock  the accounting charge is measured at the grant date fair value and expensed as non cash compensation over the vesting term using the straight line basis for service only awards and the accelerated basis for performance based awards with graded vesting 
for certain cliff vesting awards with performance criteria  we also use anticipated future results in determining the fair value of the award 
such value is recognized as expense over the service period  net of estimated forfeitures  using the straight line recognition method 
the amount of stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of income is reduced by 
table of contents estimated forfeitures  as the amount recorded is based on awards ultimately expected to vest 
the expense associated with rsu awards to be settled in cash is initially measured at fair value at the grant date and expensed ratably over the vesting term  recording a liability subject to mark to market adjustments for changes in the price of the respective common stock as compensation expense 
management must make certain estimates and assumptions regarding stock awards that will ultimately vest  and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures  including types of awards  employee class  and historical experience 
the forfeiture rate is estimated at the grant date based on historical experience and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods for any changes to the estimated forfeiture rate from that previously estimated 
for any vesting tranche of an award  the cumulative amount of compensation cost recognized is equal to the portion of the grant date value of the award tranche that is actually vested at that date 
actual results and future estimates may differ substantially from our current estimates 
as of december   ilg had approximately million of unrecognized compensation cost  net of estimated forfeitures  related to all equity based awards  which is currently expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately years 
of the million of unrecognized compensation cost  relates to an employee class group comprised of certain key employees for which we do not expect rsus to be forfeited 
for awards in which we expect forfeitures to occur  a change to our estimated forfeiture rate would have an impact of less than  to our unrecognized compensation cost as of december  income taxes accounting for our income taxes requires significant judgment in the evaluation of our uncertain tax positions and in the calculation of our provision for income taxes 
pursuant to asc topic income taxes asc  we adopted a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate available evidence to determine if it appears more likely than not that an uncertain tax position will be sustained on an audit by a taxing authority  based solely on the technical merits of the tax position 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settling the uncertain tax position 
although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions  the ultimate outcome of these tax matters may differ from our expectations 
we adjust our reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the completion of a tax audit  expiration of the applicable statute of limitations  the refinement of an estimate  and interest accruals associated with uncertain tax positions until they are resolved 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
see note  income taxes 
our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in our deferred tax assets or liabilities  the valuation of our uncertain tax positions  or by changes in tax laws  regulations  accounting principles  or interpretations thereof

the increase in transaction revenue is a result of higher transaction related fees of million and an increase of million in transaction revenue from exchanges and getaways  partly offset by a decrease of million in reservation servicing fees 
higher transaction revenue from exchanges and getaways was due to a increase in average fee per transaction  partially offset by a decrease of in exchange and getaway transaction activity  which reflects the effect of a shift in the mix and availability of exchange and getaway inventory and changes in travel patterns experienced to a greater extent in the first half of overall interval network average revenue per member remained relatively flat  increasing to in from in

ilg s principles of financial reporting definition of ilg s non gaap measures earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda is defined as net income excluding  if applicable interest income and interest expense  income taxes  depreciation expense  and amortization expense of intangibles 
adjusted ebitda is defined as ebitda excluding  if applicable non cash compensation expense  goodwill and asset impairments and other non operating income and expense 

table of contents our presentation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
we believe these measures are useful to investors because they represent the consolidated operating results from our segments  excluding the effects of any non cash expenses 
we also believe these non gaap financial measures improve the transparency of our disclosures  provide a meaningful presentation of our results from our business operations  excluding the impact of certain items not related to our core business operations and improve the period to period comparability of results from business operations 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda have certain limitations in that they do not take into account the impact of certain expenses to our statement of operations  including for adjusted ebitda  non cash compensation 
we endeavor to compensate for the limitations of these non gaap measures presented by also providing the comparable gaap measure with equal or greater prominence and descriptions of the reconciling items  including quantifying such items  to derive the non gaap measure 
we report ebitda and adjusted ebitda as supplemental measures to results reported pursuant to gaap 
these measures are among the primary metrics by which we evaluate the performance of our businesses  on which our internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated 
we believe that investors should have access to the same set of tools that we use in analyzing our results 
these non gaap measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap  but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap results 
we provide and encourage investors to examine the reconciling adjustments between the gaap and non gaap measures which are discussed below 
constant currency represents current period results of operations determined by translating our functional currency results to us dollars our reporting currency using the actual blended rate of translation from the comparable prior period 
we believe that the presentation of our results of operations excluding the effect of foreign currency translations serves to enhance the understanding of our performance  improves transparency of our disclosures  provides meaningful presentations of our results from our business operations by excluding this effect not related to our core business operations and improves the period to period comparability of results from business operations 
pro forma results we will only present ebitda and or adjusted ebitda on a pro forma basis if we view a particular transaction as significant in size or transformational in nature 
for the periods presented in this report  there are no transactions that we have included on a pro forma basis 
non cash expenses that are excluded from ilg s non gaap measures as applicable amortization expense of intangibles is a non cash expense relating primarily to acquisitions 
at the time of an acquisition  the intangible assets of the acquired company  such as customer relationships  purchase agreements and resort management agreements are valued and amortized over their estimated lives 
we believe that since intangibles represent costs incurred by the acquired company to build value prior to acquisition  they were part of transaction costs 
depreciation expense is a non cash expense relating to our property and equipment and is recorded on a straight line basis to allocate the cost of depreciable assets to operations over their estimated service lives 
non cash compensation expense consists principally of expense associated with the grants  including unvested grants assumed in acquisitions  of restricted stock  restricted stock units and stock options 
these expenses are not paid in cash  and we will include the related shares in our future calculations of diluted shares of stock outstanding 
upon vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock units and the exercise of certain stock options  the awards will be settled  at our discretion  on a net basis  with us remitting the required tax withholding amount from our current funds

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk we conduct business in certain foreign markets  primarily in the united kingdom and the european union 
our foreign currency risk primarily relates to our investments in foreign subsidiaries 
table of contents that transact business in a functional currency other than the us dollar 
this exposure is mitigated as we have generally reinvested profits in our international operations 
as currency exchange rates change  translation of the income statements of our international businesses into us dollars affects year over year comparability of operating results 
in addition  we are exposed to foreign currency risk related to transactions and or assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency 
historically  we have not hedged currency risks 
however  our foreign currency exposure related to eu vat liabilities denominated in euros is largely offset by euro denominated cash balances 
for the year ended december   operating foreign currency exchange attributable to foreign currency remeasurements of operating assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than their functional currency  primarily related to euro denominated value added tax liabilities  resulted in a net gain of million  and the amount is inconsequential for non operating foreign exchange included a net gain of million for the year ended december  and net losses of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  attributable to cash held in certain countries in currencies other than their functional currency 
the favorable fluctuation for the year ended december  was principally driven by us dollar positions held at december  affected by the stronger dollar compared to the mexican peso  partly offset by a strengthening of the colombian peso against the us dollar 
the unfavorable fluctuations for and were principally driven by us dollar positions held at december  and affected by the shift in the value of the dollar primarily to the british pound  mexican peso  and colombian peso 
the venezuelan bolivar cash held impacted our foreign exchange net loss in given our change to the us dollar as the functional currency for that entity due to highly inflationary accounting  partially offset by a gain realized in june due to our change from the parallel market rate to the sitme rate for remeasurement purposes 
in april  we transferred the majority of the cash from our venezuelan entity s bolivar denominated bank account in venezuela to our venezuelan entity s us dollar denominated bank account in the us and consequently reduced the exposure going forward 
as we increase our operations in international markets we become increasingly exposed to potentially volatile movements in currency exchange rates 
the economic impact of currency exchange rate movements on us is often linked to variability in real growth  inflation  interest rates  governmental actions and other factors
