doral mortgage units are co located in of the retail bank branches of doral bank in puerto rico

for the years ended december    and loan purchases totaled approximately million  million and million  respectively 
for more information on doral financial s loan origination channels  refer to table j loan origination sources in part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  in this report 
mortgage loan underwriting doral bank s underwriting standards are designed to comply with the relevant guidelines set forth by the department of housing and urban development hud  gnma  rhs  va  fnma  fhlmc  federal and puerto rico banking regulatory authorities  private mortgage investment conduits and private mortgage insurers  as applicable 
doral bank s underwriting policies focus primarily on the borrower s ability to pay and secondarily on collateral value 
the maximum loan to value ltv ratio on conventional first mortgages generally does not exceed 
doral bank also offers certain first mortgage products with higher ltv ratios  which may require private mortgage insurance 
in conjunction with a first mortgage  doral bank may also provide a borrower with additional financing through a closed end second mortgage loan  whose combined ltv ratio exceeds 
doral bank does not originate adjustable rate mortgages arm or negatively amortizing loans 
however  the company has entered into certain loss mitigation arrangements that provide for a temporary reduction in interest rates 
the company uses external credit scores as a useful measure for assessing the credit quality of a borrower 
these scores are supplied by credit information providers  based on statistical models that summarize an individual s credit record 
fico scores  developed by fair isaac corporation  are the most commonly used credit scores 

table of contents doral bank sells the majority of its conforming mortgage loan originations and retains the majority of its non conforming loan originations in portfolio 
the company s underwriting process is established to achieve a uniform rules based standard while targeting high quality non conforming loan originations which is consistent with the company s goal of retaining a greater portion of its mortgage loan production 
mortgage loan servicing when doral financial sells originated or purchased mortgage loans  it generally retains the right to service such loans and to receive the associated servicing fees 
doral financial s principal source of servicing rights has traditionally been its mortgage loan production 
the company also seeks to purchase servicing rights in bulk when it can identify attractive opportunities 
doral believes that loan servicing for third parties is important to its asset liability management tools because it provides an asset whose value in general tends to move in the opposite direction to the value of its loan and investment portfolio 
the asset also provides additional fee income to help offset the cost of its mortgage operations 
servicing rights represent a contractual right and not a beneficial ownership interest in the underlying mortgage loans 
failure to service the loans in accordance with contract requirements may lead to the termination of the servicing rights and the loss of future servicing fees 
in general  doral bank s servicing agreements are terminable by the investors for cause 
however  certain servicing arrangements  such as those with fnma and fhlmc  contain termination provisions that may be triggered by changes in the servicer s financial condition that materially and adversely affect its ability to provide satisfactory servicing of the loans 
as of december   approximately  and of doral financial s mortgage loans serviced for others related to mortgage servicing for fnma  fhlmc and gnma  respectively 
as of december   doral bank serviced approximately billion in mortgage loans on behalf of third parties 
termination of doral bank s servicing rights by any of these agencies could have a material adverse effect on doral financial s results of operations and financial condition 
during  no servicing agreements have been terminated 
in certain instances  the company also services loans with no contractual servicing fee 
the servicing asset or liability associated with this type of servicing arrangement is evaluated solely based on ancillary income  float  late fees  prepayment penalties and costs 
doral bank s mortgage loan servicing portfolio is subject to reduction by reason of normal amortization  prepayments and foreclosure of outstanding mortgage loans 
additionally  doral bank may sell mortgage loan servicing rights from time to time to other institutions if market conditions are favorable 
for additional information regarding the composition of doral financial s servicing portfolio as of each of the company s last three fiscal year ends  refer to table k loans serviced for third parties in part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  in this report 
the degree of credit risk associated with a mortgage loan servicing portfolio is largely dependent on the extent to which the servicing portfolio is non recourse or recourse 
in non recourse servicing  the principal credit risk to the servicer is the cost of temporary advances of funds 
in recourse servicing  the servicer agrees to share credit risk with the owner of the mortgage loans  such as fnma or fhlmc  or with a private investor  insurer or guarantor 
losses on recourse servicing occur primarily when foreclosure sale proceeds of the property underlying a defaulted mortgage loan are less than the outstanding principal balance and accrued interest of such mortgage loan and the cost of holding and disposing of the underlying property 
prior to  doral financial often sold non conforming loans on a partial recourse basis 
these recourse obligations were retained by doral financial when doral bank assumed the servicing rights from doral financial 
for additional information regarding recourse obligations  see part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  off balance sheet activities in this report 
sale of loans and securitization activities doral financial sells or securitizes a portion of the residential mortgage loans that it originates and purchases to generate income 
these loans are underwritten to investor standards  including the standards of fnma  fhlmc  and gnma 
as described below  doral financial utilizes various channels to sell its mortgage 
table of contents products 
doral financial issues gnma guaranteed mortgage backed securities  which involve the packaging of fha  rhs or va loans into pools of million or more for sale primarily to broker dealers and other institutional investors 
during the years ended december   and  doral financial issued approximately million  million and million  respectively  in gnma guaranteed mortgage backed securities 
conforming conventional loans are generally either sold directly to fnma  fhlmc or private investors for cash  or are grouped into pools of million or more in aggregate principal balance and exchanged for fnma or fhlmc issued mortgage backed securities  which doral financial sells to broker dealers 
in connection with such exchanges  doral financial pays guarantee fees to fnma and fhlmc 
the issuance of mortgage backed securities provides doral financial with flexibility in selling the mortgage loans that it originates or purchases and also provides income by increasing the value and marketability of such loans 
for the years ended december   and  doral financial securitized approximately million  million and million  respectively  of loans into fnma and fhlmc mortgage backed securities 
in addition  for the years ended december   and  doral financial sold approximately million  million and million  respectively  of loans through the fnma and fhlmc cash window programs 
when the loans backing a gnma security are initially securitized they are treated as sales and the company continues to service the underlying loans 
the company is required to bring individual delinquent gnma loans that it previously accounted for as sold back onto its books as loan assets when  under the gnma mortgage backed securities guide  the loan meets gnma s specified delinquency criteria and is eligible for repurchase 
the rebooking of gnma loans is required together with a liability for the same amount regardless of whether the company  as seller servicer  intends to exercise the repurchase buy back option since the company is deemed to have regained effective control over these loans 
at december   and  the loans held for sale portfolio includes million  million and million  respectively  related to defaulted loans backing gnma securities for which the company has an unconditional option but not an obligation to repurchase the defaulted loans 
payment on these loans is guaranteed by fha 
prior to the fourth quarter of  doral financial s non conforming loan sales were generally made on a limited recourse basis 
as of december   and  doral financial s maximum contractual exposure relating to its portfolio of loans sold with recourse was approximately billion  billion and billion  respectively  which included recourse obligations to fnma and fhlmc as of such dates of approximately billion  billion and billion  respectively 
as of december   and  doral financial had a recourse liability of million  million and million  respectively  to reflect estimated losses from such recourse arrangements 
doral financial estimates its liability from its recourse obligations based on historical losses from foreclosure and disposition of mortgage loans adjusted for expectations of changes in portfolio behavior and market environment 
the company believes that it has an adequate valuation for its recourse obligation as of december  and  but actual future recourse obligations may differ from expected results 
in the past the company sold non conforming loans to financial institutions in the us mainland on a non recourse basis  except recourse for certain early defaults 
since  the company is retaining all of its non conforming loan production in its loan receivable portfolio 
while the company currently anticipates that it will continue to retain its non conforming loan production in portfolio  in the future  the company may seek to continue to diversify secondary market outlets for its non conforming loan products both in the us mainland and puerto rico 
in the ordinary course of business  doral financial makes certain representations and warranties to purchasers and insurers of mortgage loans at the time of the loan sales to third parties regarding the characteristics of the loans sold  and in certain circumstances  such as in the event of early or first payment default 
to the extent the loans do not meet specified criteria  such as a breach of contract of a representation or warranty or an early payment default  doral financial may be required to repurchase the mortgage loan and bear any subsequent loss related to the loan 
doral financial works with purchasers to review the claims and correct

puerto rico secondary mortgage market and favorable tax treatment in general  the puerto rico market for mortgage backed securities is an extension of the us market with respect to pricing  rating of investment instruments  and other matters 
however  doral financial has benefited historically from certain tax incentives provided to puerto rico residents to invest in fha and va loans and gnma securities backed by such loans 
under the puerto rico internal revenue code the pr code  the interest received on fha and va loans used to finance the original purchase of newly constructed housing in puerto rico and mortgage backed securities backed by such loans is exempt from puerto rico income taxes 
this favorable tax treatment allows doral financial to sell tax exempt puerto rico gnma mortgage backed securities to local investors at higher prices than those at which comparable instruments trade in the us mainland  and reduces its effective tax rate through the receipt of tax exempt interest 
insurance agency activities in order to take advantage of the cross marketing opportunities provided by financial modernization legislation enacted in  doral financial entered the insurance agency business in puerto rico 
doral insurance agency currently earns commissions by acting as agent in connection with the sale of insurance policies issued by unaffiliated insurance companies 
during  and  doral insurance agency produced insurance fees and commissions of million  million and million  respectively 
doral insurance agency s activities are closely integrated with the company s mortgage loan originations with most policies sold to mortgage customers 
future growth of doral insurance agency s revenues will be tied to the company s level of mortgage originations  its ability to expand the products and services it provides and its ability to cross market its services to doral financial s existing customer base

in computing its interest expense deduction  doral financial s interest deduction is reduced in the same proportion that its average exempt obligations including fha and va loans and gnma securities bear to its average total assets 
therefore  to the extent that doral financial holds fha or va loans and other tax exempt obligations  part of its interest expense may be disallowed for tax purposes 
the company is evaluating the impact of the tax reform on its results of operations including the election to be taxed under the code

these external factors include exports  direct investment  the amount of federal transfer payments  the level of interest rates  the rate of inflation  and tourist expenditures 
during the fiscal year ended june   approximately of puerto rico s exports went to the us mainland  which was also the source of approximately of puerto rico s imports 
in the past  the economy of puerto rico has generally followed economic trends in the overall united states economy 
however  in recent years  economic growth in puerto rico has lagged behind growth in the united states 
the dominant sectors of the puerto rico economy in terms of production and income are manufacturing and services 
the manufacturing sector has undergone fundamental changes over the years as a result of an increased emphasis on higher wage  high technology industries  such as pharmaceuticals  biotechnology  computers  microprocessors  professional and scientific instruments  and certain high technology machinery and equipment 
the service sector  including finance  insurance  real estate  wholesale and retail trade  transportation  communications and public utilities  and other services  also plays a major role in the economy 
it ranks second to manufacturing in contribution to puerto rico s gross domestic product  but first in terms of contribution to puerto rico s real gross national product 
the service sector leads all sectors in providing employment 
puerto rico s economy is currently in a recession that began in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year that ended june   a fiscal year in which the real gross national product grew by only 
although the puerto rico economy is closely linked to the united states economy  in recent fiscal years the performance of the puerto rico economy has lagged the performance of the united states economy 
for fiscal years   and  puerto rico s real gross national product decreased by   and  respectively 
according to the puerto rico planning board s latest projections made in march  puerto rico s real gross national product was projected to have contracted by during fiscal year puerto rico s real gross national product for fiscal year  however  is projected to grow by 
according to data published by the puerto rico department of labor  the number of persons employed in puerto rico during fiscal year averaged  a decrease of compared to the previous fiscal year  and the unemployment rate averaged 
during the first four months of fiscal year  total employment averaged  a decline of with respect to the same period of the prior fiscal year  and the unemployment rate averaged 
future growth of the puerto rico economy will depend on several factors including the condition of the united states economy  the relative stability of the price of oil imports  the exchange value of the united states dollar  the level of interest rates  the effectiveness of the recently approved changes to the puerto rico income tax 
table of contents code and other tax laws  and the continuing economic uncertainty generated by the puerto rico government s fiscal condition described below 
fiscal condition 
since  puerto rico has faced a number of fiscal challenges  including an imbalance between its general fund total revenues and expenditures 
the imbalance reached its highest level in fiscal year  when the deficit was approximately billion 
prior to fiscal year  the commonwealth bridged such deficits through the use of non recurring measures  such as borrowing from the government development bank for puerto rico or in the bond market  postponing the payment of various government expenses  such as payments to suppliers and utilities providers  and other one time measures such as the use of derivatives and borrowings collateralized with government owned real estate and uncollected general fund revenues 
fiscal stabilization plan 
in january  the puerto rico developed and commenced implementing a multi year fiscal stabilization and economic reconstruction plan designed to achieve fiscal balance  restore sustainable economic growth and safeguard the investment grade ratings of the commonwealth 
the fiscal stabilization plan seeks to achieve budgetary balance  while addressing expected fiscal deficits in the intervening years through the implementation of a number of initiatives  including the following i gradual operating expense reduction plan through reduction of operating expenses  including payroll  which is the main component of government expenditures  and the reorganization of the executive branch  ii a combination of temporary and permanent revenue raising measures  coupled with additional tax enforcement measures  and iii certain financial measures which included a bond issuance program through puerto rico sales tax financing corporation cofina by its spanish language acronym and restructuring of a portion of the commonwealth s debt service 
the financial measures were anchored on the bond issuance program of cofina 
during fiscal years and  cofina issued approximately billion and billion  respectively  of revenue bonds payable from sales and use tax collections transferred to cofina 
the proceeds obtained from cofina bond issuance program have been used and are being used to repay existing government debt including debts with gdb  finance operating expenses of the commonwealth for fiscal years through  including costs related to the implementation of a workforce reduction plan  the funding of an economic stimulus plan  as described below  and for other purposes to address the fiscal imbalance while the fiscal stabilization plan was being implemented 
during the fiscal year  cofina expects to issue approximately billion of additional revenue bonds the proceeds of which will be mainly used to finance a portion of the government s operating expenses for fiscal year  refund outstanding debt obligations payable from commonwealth appropriations  and refund certain outstanding cofina bonds 
during the last three fiscal years  the commonwealth has been able to reduce the deficit by both increasing its revenues and decreasing its expenditures 
the commonwealth s ability to continue reducing the deficit will depend in part on its ability to continue increasing revenues and reducing expenditures  which in turn depends on a number of factors  including improvements in general economic conditions 
economic reconstruction plan 
the puerto rico government administration also developed and implemented a short term economic reconstruction plan 
the cornerstone of this plan was the implementation of federal and local economic stimulus programs 
puerto rico was awarded approximately billion in stimulus funds under american recovery and reinvestment act of arra enacted by the us government to provide a stimulus to the us economy in the wake of the global economic downturn 
the funds awarded to puerto rico included tax relief  expansion of unemployment benefits and other social welfare provisions  and domestic spending in education  health care  and infrastructure  among other measures 
the administration complemented the federal stimulus with additional short and medium term supplemental stimulus measures seeking to address specific local challenges and providing investment in strategic areas 
these measures included a local million economic stimulus plan to supplement the federal plan 
the local stimulus was composed of three main elements i capital improvements  ii stimulus for small and medium sized businesses  and iii consumer relief in the form of direct payments to retirees  mortgage debt restructuring for consumers that face risk of default  and consumer stimulus for the purchase of housing 

table of contents economic development plan 
the administration also developed the strategic model for a new economy  which is a comprehensive long term economic development plan aimed at improving puerto rico s overall competitiveness and business environment and increasing private sector participation in the puerto rico economy 
the administration is emphasizing the following initiatives to enhance puerto rico s competitive position i overhauling the permitting process  ii reducing energy costs  iii reforming the tax system  iv promoting the development of various projects through public private partnerships  and v implementing strategic initiatives targeted at specific economic sectors and development of certain strategic regional projects 
the first initiative  the reengineering of puerto rico s permitting and licensing process  has already been achieved 
on december   the governor signed into law act no 
 which overhauls the existing permitting and licensing process in puerto rico in order to provide for a leaner and more efficient process the fosters economic development 
in the short term  this restructuring is focused on eliminating the significant backlog of unprocessed permits that are currently in the pipeline of various government agencies 
in the long term  the law seeks to significantly reduce the number of inter agency processes and transactions that were required by creating a centralized  client focused permit system that simplifies and shortens the permitting process for applicants 
with respect to the second initiative  reducing energy costs  the administration enacted acts no 
and in july  which generally provide for a new energy policy that seeks to lower energy costs and reduce energy price volatility by reducing puerto rico s dependence on fuel oil and the promotion of diverse  renewable energy technologies 
act no 
focuses on reducing puerto rico s dependence on fossil fuels  particularly fuel oil  through the promotion of diverse  renewable energy technologies 
act no 
assembles under one law the incentives for the construction and use of renewable energy sources 
the third initiative involved a comprehensive review of the commonwealth s income tax system and approval of a tax reform directed at reducing personal and corporate income tax rates 
legislation to implement the first phase of tax reform was enacted as act no 
on november  legislation to implement the second phase of tax reform was enacted as act no 
on january  the tax reform is focused on providing tax relief to individuals and corporations  providing economic development and job creation  simplifying the tax system and reducing tax evasion through enhanced tax compliance measures 
in general terms  the tax reform is intended to be revenue positive for the commonwealth as it includes  among other things  a temporary excise tax on affiliates of multinational manufacturers operating in puerto rico  the elimination of certain incentives and tax credits  and enhanced tax compliance measures to finance the tax rate reductions for corporations and individuals 
to further stimulate economic development and cope with the fiscal crisis  the administration established a legal framework through act no 
approved in june to authorize and promote the use of public private partnerships to finance and develop infrastructure projects and operate and manage certain public assets 
public private partnerships are long term contracts between government and non governmental entities to develop  operate  manage or maximize infrastructure projects and or government services 
act no 
 among other things  established the puerto rico public private partnerships authority as the entity tasked with implementing the commonwealth s public policy with respect the public private partnerships 
during fiscal years and the administration evaluated and or commenced procurement for several public private partnership priority projects involving  among other things  the energy  transportation  water and public school infrastructure sectors 
as part of the government s initiative  the public private partnership authority ppp authority and the puerto rico highways and transportation authority recently completed the procurement for a concession of two toll roads in puerto rico 
the financial closing for the transaction was completed in september  and as result of this transaction  the puerto rico highways and transportation authority received lump sum payment of billion and a commitment to invest million in immediate improvements and comply with world class operating standards 
to modernize public school facilities throughout puerto rico and improve academic performance  the ppp authority launched a program aimed at modernizing and building a selected number of public schools throughout 
table of contents puerto rico 
as of june  the ppp authority had awarded approximately million in contracts and construction had begun in approximately schools 
in addition  during the ppp authority and the puerto rico ports authority commenced the procurement process for a concession to finance  operate  maintain and improve the luis munoz marin international airport  the busiest airport in the caribbean 
in august they received statements of qualifications from twelve world class consortia 
the ppp authority and the puerto rico ports authority issued a request for proposals to six of the potential bidders for the airport in october and expect to select a winning bidder in the first quarter of the administration has also identified strategic initiatives to promote economic growth in various sectors of the economy where the commonwealth has competitive advantages and several strategic regional projects aimed as fostering balanced economic development throughout the island 
these projects  some of which are ongoing  include tourism and urban redevelopment projects 
unfunded pension benefit obligations and funding shortfalls of the retirement systems 
one of the challenges every puerto rico administration has faced during the past twenty years is how to address the growing unfunded pension obligations and funding shortfalls of the three government retirements systems that are funded principally with budget appropriations from the commonwealth s general fund 
as of june   the date of the latest actuarial valuations of the three retirement systems  the unfunded actuarial accrued liability including basic and system administered benefits for the employees retirement system  the teachers retirement system and judiciary retirement system were billion  billion and million  respectively  and the funded ratios were  and  respectively 
based on current employer and member contributions to the retirement systems  the unfunded actuarial accrued liabilities will continue to increase significantly  with a corresponding decrease in their funded ratios  since the annual contributions are not sufficient to fund pension benefits  and thus  are also insufficient to amortize the unfunded actuarial accrued liabilities 
because annual benefit payments and administrative expenses of the retirement systems have been significantly larger than annual employer and member contributions  the retirement systems have been forced to use investment income  borrowings and sale of investment portfolio assets to cover funding shortfalls 
the funding shortfall basic system benefits  administrative expenses and debt service in excess of contributions for fiscal year for the employees retirement system  the teachers retirement system and judiciary retirement system were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
for fiscal year  the funding shortfall is expected to be million  million and million  respectively 
as a result  the assets of the retirement systems are expected to continue to decline and eventually be depleted during the next seven to nine years 
since the commonwealth and other participating employers are ultimately responsible for any funding deficiency in the three retirement systems  the depletion of the assets available to cover retirement benefits will require the commonwealth and other participating employers to cover such funding deficiency 
it is estimated that the commonwealth would be responsible for approximately of the combined annual funding deficiency of the three retirement systems  with the balance being the responsibility of the municipalities and public corporations 
ultimately  since the commonwealth s general fund is required to cover a significant amount of the funding deficiency  the commonwealth would have difficulty funding the required annual contributions unless it implements significant reforms to the retirement systems  obtains additional revenues  or takes other budgetary measures 
in order to address the growing unfunded benefit obligations and funding shortfalls of the three retirement systems  the governor of puerto rico established in february a special commission to make recommendations for improving the fiscal solvency of the three retirement systems 
the special commission delivered its recommendations to the governor in october as a result of the special commission s report and the government s analysis  the governor submitted two bills to the legislative assembly to address in part the retirement systems financial condition 
one of the bills was enacted as act no 
and resulted in the transfer of million of funds to the employees retirement 
table of contents system which was invested in capital appreciation bonds issued by cofina maturing annually from to and accreting interest at 
the principal of the cofina bonds will grow to approximately billion at their maturity dates 
the second bill was enacted as act no 
and provides for an increase in employer contributions to the employees retirement system and the teachers retirement system of of covered payroll in each of the next five fiscal years and by of covered payroll in each of the following five fiscal years 
as a result of these increases  the employees retirement system and the teachers retirement system would receive approximately million and million  respectively  in additional employer contributions during fiscal year  and the additional employer contributions are projected to increase gradually each fiscal year to million and million  respectively  by fiscal year as a result of these increases in employer contributions to the employees retirement system and the teachers retirement system  the administrator of the retirement systems projects that the period before depletion of assets of these two systems would be extended by three to four years 
regulation and supervision described below are the material elements of selected federal and puerto rico laws and regulations applicable to doral financial and its subsidiaries 
many of these laws and regulations generally aim to protect our depositors and our customers  not necessarily our shareholders or our creditors 
any changes in applicable laws or regulations  and in their application by regulatory agencies  may materially affect our business and prospects 
proposed legislative or regulatory changes may also affect our operations 
the following description summarizes some of the laws and regulations to which we are subject 
references to applicable statutes and regulations are brief summaries  do not purport to be complete  and are qualified in their entirety by reference to such statutes and regulations 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of on july   president obama signed into law the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of the dodd frank act 
the dodd frank act has had  and will have  a broad impact on the financial services industry  including significant regulatory and compliance changes including  among other things  i enhanced resolution authority of troubled and failing banks and their holding companies  ii increased capital and liquidity requirements  iii increased regulatory examination fees  iv changes to assessments to be paid to the fdic for federal deposit insurance  and v numerous other provisions designed to improve supervision and oversight of  and strengthening safety and soundness for  the financial services sector 
additionally  the dodd frank act establishes a new framework for systemic risk oversight within the financial system to be distributed among new and existing federal regulatory agencies  including the financial stability oversight council  the federal reserve  the office of the comptroller of the currency  and the fdic 
a summary of certain provisions of the dodd frank act is set forth below  along with information set forth in other parts of this regulation and supervision section 
increased capital standards and enhanced supervision 
the federal banking agencies are required to establish minimum leverage and risk based capital requirements for banks and bank holding companies 
these new standards will be no lower than current regulatory capital and leverage standards applicable to insured depository institutions and may  in fact  be higher when established by the agencies 
the fdic and other federal banking agencies issued a joint notice on june  adopting a final rule that establishes a floor for the risk based capital requirements applicable to the largest  internationally active banking organizations 
the dodd frank act also increases regulatory oversight  supervision and examination of banks  bank holding companies and their respective subsidiaries by the appropriate regulatory agency 
the consumer financial protection bureau bureau 
the dodd frank act created the bureau within the federal reserve 
the bureau is tasked with establishing and implementing rules and regulations under certain federal consumer protection laws with respect to the conduct of providers of certain consumer financial products and services 
the bureau has rulemaking authority over many of the statutes governing products and services offered to bank consumers 
in addition  the dodd frank act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and 
table of contents regulations that are more stringent than those regulations promulgated by the bureau  and state attorneys general are permitted to enforce consumer protection rules adopted by the bureau against state chartered institutions 
deposit insurance 
the dodd frank act made permanent the  deposit insurance limit for insured deposits 
amendments to the federal deposit insurance act also revised the assessment base against which an insured depository institution s deposit insurance premiums paid to the deposit insurance fund dif will be calculated 
under the amendments  the assessment base will no longer be the institution s deposit base  but rather its average consolidated total assets less its average tangible equity during the assessment period 
additionally  the dodd frank act made changes to the minimum designated reserve ratio of the dif  increasing the minimum from percent to percent of the estimated amount of total insured deposits and eliminating the requirement that the fdic pay dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds 
in december  the fdic increased the reserve ratio to percent 
the dodd frank act also provides that depository institutions are now permitted to pay interest on demand deposit accounts  and in this respect the federal reserve approved a final rule repealing regulation q on july  transactions with affiliates 
the dodd frank act enhances the requirements for certain transactions with affiliates under sections a and b of the federal reserve act  including an expansion of the definition of covered transactions and increasing the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered transactions must be maintained 
transactions with insiders 
insider transaction limitations are expanded through the strengthening of loan restrictions to insiders and the expansion of the types of transactions subject to the various limits  including derivative transactions  repurchase agreements  reverse repurchase agreements and securities lending or borrowing transactions 
restrictions are also placed on certain asset sales to and from an insider to an institution  including requirements that such sales be on market terms and  in certain circumstances  approved by the institution s board of directors 
enhanced lending limits 
the dodd frank act strengthens the existing limits on a depository institution s credit exposure to one borrower 
current banking law limits a depository institution s ability to extend credit to one person or group of related persons in an amount exceeding certain thresholds 
the dodd frank act expands the scope of these restrictions to include credit exposure arising from derivative transactions  repurchase agreements  and securities lending and borrowing transactions 
compensation practices 
the dodd frank act provides that the appropriate federal regulators must establish standards prohibiting as an unsafe and unsound practice any compensation plan of a bank holding company or other covered financial institution that provides an insider or other employee with excessive compensation or could lead to a material financial loss to such firm 
on march   the fdic and other federal banking and securities agencies issued a joint notice of proposed rulemaking on incentive based compensation arrangements as required by the dodd frank act 
the proposed rule has five key components i requiring the deferral of at least of incentive compensation for a minimum of three years for executive officers of financial institutions with consolidated assets of billion or more  ii prohibiting incentive based compensation arrangements for executive officers  employees  directors and principal shareholders covered persons of financial institutions with more than billion in assets that would encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation  iii prohibiting incentive based compensation arrangements for covered persons of financial institutions with more than billion in assets that would expose the institution to inappropriate risks by providing compensation that could lead to material financial loss  iv requiring policies and procedures of financial institutions with more than billion in assets for incentive based compensation arrangements that are commensurate with the size and complexity of the institution  and v requiring annual reports on incentive compensation structures to the institution s appropriate federal regulator 
debit card interchange fees and routing 
the dodd frank act amends the electronic funds transfer act to  among other things  give the federal reserve the authority to establish rules regarding interchange fees charged for electronic debit transactions by payment card issuers having assets over billion and to enforce a new statutory requirement that such fees be reasonable and proportional to the actual cost of the transaction to the issuer 
in june the federal reserve issued the final rule  which generally became effective on october   that establishes standards for debit card interchange fees and prohibits network exclusivity 
table of contents arrangements and routing restrictions 
under the new regulation ii  the maximum permissible interchange fee that an issuer may receive for an electronic transaction will be the sum of cents per transaction and basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction 
in accordance with the dodd frank act  issuers that  together with their affiliates  have assets of less than billion are exempt from the debit card interchange fee standards 
the new regulation also prohibits all issuers and networks from restricting the number of networks over which electronic debit transactions may be processed to less than two unaffiliated networks 
issuers and networks are also prohibited from inhibiting a merchant s ability to direct the routing of the electronic debt transaction over any network that the issuer has enabled to process them 
we expect that many of the requirements called for in the dodd frank act will be implemented over time  and most will be subject to implementing regulations over the course of several years 
given the uncertainty associated with the manner in which the provisions of the dodd frank act will be implemented by the various regulatory agencies and through regulations  the full extent of the impact such requirements will have on financial institutions operations is unclear 
the changes resulting from the dodd frank act may impact the profitability of our business activities  require changes to certain of our business practices  impose upon us more stringent capital  liquidity and leverage ratio requirements or otherwise adversely affect our business 
these changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes in order to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements

the principal restrictions are the following i prohibits mortgage lenders and brokers from giving or receiving compensation that varies based on loan terms other than the principal amount of the loan this prohibition effectively eliminates yield spread premiums  ii requires mortgage lenders to determine that the consumer has the reasonable ability to repay the loan according to its terms based upon a variety of factors including credit history  current income  expected income  and current obligations  and iii creates a safe harbor for mortgage lenders with respect to qualified mortgages a qualified mortgage is a mortgage that meets the following requirements term does not exceed years  the consumer may not defer the payment of principal  points and fees may not exceed of the amount of the loan  negative amortization is not allowed  and no balloon payments are permitted except under certain circumstances

the proposed rule also states that the federal reserve may determine that any bank holding company  which is not a covered company under the proposed rule  shall be subject to one or more of the standards established under the proposed rule if the federal reserve determines that doing so is necessary or appropriate to promote the safety and soundness of such bank holding company or to promote financial stability 
the federal reserve is proposing that covered firms would need to comply with many of the enhanced standards a year after they are finalized  and that the requirements relating to stress testing to take effect shortly after the proposed rule is finalized 
on january   the fdic issued a proposed rule that would require certain large depository institutions to conduct annual capital adequacy stress tests 
the proposed rule  which implements a requirement of the dodd frank act  would apply to state nonmember banks with total consolidated assets of more than billion 
the proposed rule defines stress test as a process to assess the potential impact of economic and 
table of contents financial conditions on the consolidated earnings  losses and capital of a bank over a set planning horizon  taking into account the current condition of the bank and its risks  exposures  strategies  and activities 
financial modernization legislation as discussed above  on january   doral financial withdrew its election to be treated as a financial holding company 
under the gramm leach bliley act  bank holding companies  all of whose depository institutions are well capitalized and well managed  as defined in the bhc act  and which obtain satisfactory community reinvestment act ratings  may elect to be treated as financial holding companies fhcs 
fhcs are permitted to engage in a broader spectrum of activities than those permitted to other bank holding companies 
fhcs can engage in any activities that are financial in nature  including insurance underwriting and brokerage  and underwriting and dealing in securities without a revenue limit or other limits applicable to foreign securities affiliates which include puerto rico securities affiliates for these purposes 
as noted above  the withdrawal of financial holding company status has not adversely affected and is not expected to adversely affect doral financial s current operations 
the gramm leach bliley act also modified other laws  including laws related to financial privacy and community reinvestment 
the new financial privacy provisions generally prohibit financial institutions  including doral financial s mortgage banking and banking subsidiaries  from disclosing non public personal financial information to third parties unless customers have the opportunity to opt out of the disclosure 
sarbanes oxley act the sarbanes oxley act of sox implemented a range of corporate governance and accounting measures to increase corporate responsibility  to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies  and to protect investors by improving the adequacy and reliability of disclosures under federal securities laws 
in addition  sox established membership requirements and responsibilities for the audit committee  imposed restrictions on the relationship between the company and external auditors  imposed additional responsibilities for the external financial statements on the chief executive officer and chief financial officer  expanded the disclosure requirements for corporate insiders  required management to evaluate its disclosure controls and procedures and its internal control over financial reporting  and required the auditors to issue a report on the internal control over financial reporting 
since the annual report on form k  the company has included in its annual report on form k its management s assessment regarding the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting 
the internal control report includes a statement of management s responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company  management s assessment as to the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting based on management s evaluation as of year end  and the frame work used by management as criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting 
capital adequacy under the federal reserve s risk based capital guidelines for bank holding companies  the minimum guidelines for the ratio of qualifying total capital total capital to risk weighted assets including certain off balance sheet items  such as standby letters of credit is 
at least half of total capital is to be comprised of common equity  retained earnings  minority interests in unconsolidated subsidiaries  noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and a limited amount of cumulative perpetual preferred stock  in the case of a bank holding company  less goodwill and certain other intangible assets discussed below tier capital 
the remainder may consist of a limited amount of subordinated debt  other preferred stock  certain other instruments and a limited amount of loan and lease loss reserves tier capital 
in computing total risk weighted assets  bank and bank holding company assets are given risk weights of   and certain non investment grade mortgage backed securities and residual interests have risk weights of 
in addition  certain off balance sheet items are given similar credit conversion factors to convert them to asset equivalent amounts to which an appropriate risk weight will apply 
most loans will be 
table of contents assigned to the risk category  except for performing first mortgage loans fully secured by to family and certain multi family residential property  which carry a risk rating 
most investment securities including  primarily  general obligation claims on states or other political subdivisions of the united states will be assigned to the category  except for municipal or state revenue bonds  which have a risk weight  and direct obligations of the us treasury or obligations backed by the full faith and credit of the us government  which have a risk weight 
in covering off balance sheet items  direct credit substitutes  including general guarantees and standby letters of credit backing financial obligations  are given a risk factor 
transaction related contingencies such as bid bonds  standby letters of credit backing non financial obligations  and undrawn commitments including commercial credit lines with an initial maturity of more than one year have a risk factor 
short term commercial letters of credit are converted at and certain short term unconditionally cancelable commitments have a factor 
in addition  the federal reserve has established minimum leverage ratio guidelines for bank holding companies 
these guidelines provide for a minimum ratio of tier capital to total assets  less goodwill and certain other intangible assets the leverage ratio of for bank holding companies that have the highest regulatory rating or have implemented the federal reserve s market risk capital measure 
all other bank holding companies are required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 
the guidelines also provide that banking organizations experiencing significant internal growth or making acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels  without significant reliance on intangible assets 
furthermore  the guidelines indicate that the federal reserve will continue to consider a tangible tier leverage ratio and other indicators of capital strength in evaluating proposals for expansion or new activities 
the tangible tier leverage ratio is the ratio of a banking organization s tier capital  less all intangibles  to average total assets  less all intangibles 
the fdic has established regulatory capital requirements for state non member insured banks  such as doral bank  that are substantially similar to those adopted by the federal reserve for bank holding companies 
on march   doral financial entered into a consent order with the federal reserve  pursuant to which doral financial submitted a capital plan in which it established a target minimum leverage ratio of for doral financial and for doral bank 
please refer to part i  item legal proceedings for additional information regarding doral financial s regulatory matters 
set forth below are doral financial s and doral bank s capital ratios at december   based on existing federal reserve and fdic guidelines doral financial doral bank well capitalized minimum total capital ratio total capital to risk weighted assets tier capital ratio tier capital to risk weighted assets leverage ratio tier capital to average assets 
doral bank s capital ratios include doral bank s us operations figures pursuant to the merger transaction completed on october  as of december   doral bank was in compliance with all the regulatory capital requirements that were applicable to it as a state non member bank 
please refer to part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  regulatory capital ratios for additional information regarding doral financial s regulatory capital ratios 
as of december   doral bank was considered a well capitalized bank for purposes of prompt corrective action regulations adopted by the fdic pursuant to the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of during the second and third quarters of  the board of directors of doral financial approved capital contributions to doral bank totaling million 
during no capital contributions were made by doral financial to doral bank 

table of contents failure to meet minimum regulatory capital requirements could result in the initiation of certain mandatory and additional discretionary actions by banking regulators against doral financial and its banking subsidiary that  if undertaken  could have a material adverse effect on doral financial  such as a variety of enforcement remedies  including  with respect to an insured bank  the termination of deposit insurance by the fdic  and to certain restrictions on its business 
see fdicia below 
under the dodd frank act  federal banking agencies are required to establish minimum leverage and risk based capital requirements for banks and bank holding companies 
these new standards will be no lower than current regulatory capital and leverage standards currently applicable to insured depository institutions and may  in fact  be higher when established by the federal banking agencies 
the fdic and other federal banking agencies issued a joint notice on june  adopting a final rule that establishes a floor for the risk based capital requirements applicable to the largest  internationally active banking organizations 
basel capital standards the current risk based capital guidelines are based upon the capital accord of the international basel committee on banking supervision  a committee of central banks and bank supervisors and regulators from the major industrialized countries that develops broad policy guidelines for use by each country s supervisors in determining the supervisory policies they apply 
a new international accord  referred to as basel ii  became mandatory for large or core international banks outside the us in total assets of billion or more or consolidated foreign exposures of billion or more and emphasizes internal assessment of credit  market and operational risk  as well as supervisory assessment and market discipline in determining minimum capital requirements 
it is optional for other banks 
in september  the group of governors and heads of supervisors of the basel committee on banking supervision  the oversight body of the basel committee  published its calibrated capital standards for major banking institutions  referred to as basel iii 
under these standards  when fully phased in on january   banking institutions will be required to maintain heightened tier common equity  tier capital  and total capital ratios  as well as maintaining a capital conservation buffer 
the tier common equity and tier capital ratio requirements will be phased in incrementally between january  and january   the deductions from common equity made in calculating tier common equity will be phased in incrementally over a four year period commencing on january   and the capital conservation buffer will be phased in incrementally between january  and january  the basel committee also announced that a countercyclical buffer of to of common equity or other fully loss absorbing capital will be implemented according to national circumstances as an extension of the conservation buffer 
the us banking agencies have not yet proposed regulations implementing basel iii 
notwithstanding the release of the basel iii framework as a final framework  the basel committee is considering further amendments to basel iii 
in addition to basel iii  dodd frank act requires or permits the federal banking agencies to adopt regulations affecting the capital requirements of financial institutions in a number of respects  including potentially more stringent capital requirements 
the ultimate impact on doral financial and doral bank of the new capital and liquidity standards that may be adopted cannot be determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors  including the final regulatory actions taken by federal banking regulators 
however  any requirement that doral financial and doral bank maintain more capital  with common equity as a more predominant component  or meet new liquidity requirements  could significantly affect our financial condition  operations  capital position and ability to pursue certain business opportunities 
prompt corrective action under fdicia under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of and the regulations promulgated thereunder fdicia  federal banking regulators must take prompt corrective action with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements 
fdicia and the regulations thereunder  establish five capital tiers well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized 
a depository institution is deemed to be well capitalized if it maintains a leverage ratio of at least  a risk based tier capital ratio of at least and a risk based total capital ratio of at least  and is not subject to any written agreement or regulatory directive 
table of contents to meet a specific capital level 
a depository institution is deemed to be adequately capitalized if it is not well capitalized but maintains a leverage ratio of at least or at least if given the highest regulatory rating and not experiencing or anticipating significant growth  a risk based tier l capital ratio of at least and a risk based total capital ratio of at least 
a depository institution is deemed to be undercapitalized if it fails to meet the standards for adequately capitalized institutions unless it is deemed to be significantly or critically undercapitalized 
an institution is deemed to be significantly undercapitalized if it has a leverage ratio of less than  a risk based tier capital ratio of less than or a risk based total capital ratio of less than 
an institution is deemed to be critically undercapitalized if it has tangible equity equal to or less of total assets 
a depository institution may be deemed to be in a capitalization category that is lower than is indicated by its actual capital position if it receives a less than satisfactory examination rating in any one of four categories 
at december   doral bank s capital exceeded the well capitalized standards 
doral bank s capital categories  as determined by applying the prompt corrective action provisions of fdicia  may not constitute an accurate representation of the overall financial condition or prospects of doral bank  and should be considered in conjunction with other available information regarding doral bank s financial condition and results of operations 
fdicia generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution including payment of a dividend or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized 
undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to restrictions on borrowing from the federal reserve system 
in addition  undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit capital restoration plans 
a depository institution s holding company must guarantee the capital plan  up to an amount equal to the lesser of i of the depository institution s assets at the time it becomes undercapitalized or ii the amount of the capital deficiency when the institution fails to comply with the plan 
the federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining  among other things  that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution s capital 
if a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan  it is treated as if it were significantly undercapitalized 
significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions  including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized  requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks 
critically undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator 
the capital based prompt corrective action provisions of fdicia and their implementing regulations apply to fdic insured depository institutions such as doral bank  but they are not directly applicable to bank holding companies  such as doral financial  which control such institutions 
however  federal banking agencies have indicated that  in regulating bank holding companies  they may take appropriate action at the holding company level based on their assessment of the effectiveness of supervisory actions imposed upon subsidiary insured depository institutions pursuant to such provisions and regulations 
interstate banking effective june   the riegle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of the riegle neal act amended the fdia and certain other statutes to permit state and national banks with different home states to merge across state lines  with the approval of the appropriate federal banking agency  unless the home state of a participating bank had passed legislation prior to may   expressly prohibiting interstate mergers 
under the riegle neal act amendments  once a state or national bank has established branches in a state  that bank may establish and acquire additional branches at any location in the state at which any bank involved in the interstate merger transaction could have established or acquired branches under applicable federal or state law 
if a state opts out of interstate branching within the specified time period  no bank in any other state may establish a branch in the state which has opted out  whether through an acquisition or de novo 
under the dodd frank act  national banks and state banks are now able to establish branches in any state if that state would permit the establishment of the branch by a state bank chartered in that state 
the amendments now permit a state bank from any state to branch into any other state as if such bank were chartered in that state 

table of contents dividend restrictions the company is subject to certain restrictions generally imposed on puerto rico corporations with respect to the declaration and payment of dividends ie  that dividends may be paid out only from the company s net assets in excess of capital or  in the absence of such excess  from the company s net earnings for such fiscal year and or the preceding fiscal year 
the federal reserve board has also issued a policy statement that  as a matter of prudent banking  a bank holding company should generally not maintain a given rate of cash dividends unless its net income available to common shareholders has been sufficient to fund fully the dividends and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent with the organization s capital needs  asset quality  and overall financial condition 
on february   the federal reserve published a supervisory letter on applying supervisory guidance and regulations on the payment of dividends  stock redemptions  and stock repurchases at bank holding companies the supervisory letter  which discusses the ability of bank holding companies to declare dividends and to redeem or repurchase equity securities 
the supervisory letter is generally consistent with prior federal reserve supervisory policies and guidance  although it places greater emphasis on discussions with the regulators prior to dividend declarations and redemption or repurchase decisions even when not explicitly required by the regulations 
the federal reserve provides that the principles discussed in the letter are applicable to all bank holding companies  but are especially relevant for bank holding companies that are experiencing financial difficulties 
the supervisory letter provides that a board of directors should eliminate  defer  or severely limit dividends if i the bank holding company s net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters  net of dividends paid during that period  is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends  ii the bank holding company s rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with capital needs and overall macroeconomic outlook  or iii the bank holding company will not meet  or is in danger of not meeting  its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios 
the supervisory letter further suggests that bank holding companies should inform the federal reserve in advance of paying a dividend that i exceeds the earnings for the quarter in which the dividend is being paid  or ii could result in a material adverse change to the organization s capital structure 
the payment of dividends to doral financial by doral bank may be affected by regulatory requirements and policies  such as the maintenance of adequate capital 
if  in the opinion of the applicable regulatory authority  a depository institution under its jurisdiction is engaged in  or is about to engage in  an unsafe or unsound practice  depending on the financial condition of the depository institution  could include the payment of dividends  such authority may require  after notice and hearing  that such depository institution cease and desist from such practice 
the fdic has indicated that the payment of dividends would constitute unsafe and unsound practice if the payment would deplete a depository institution s capital base to an inadequate level 
moreover  the fdic has issued a policy statement that generally provides that insured banks should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings 
in addition  all insured depository institutions are subject to the capital based limitations required by fdicia 
please refer to fdicia above for additional information 
on march   doral financial and doral bank entered into consent orders with the federal reserve  the fdic and the office of the commissioner 
the mutually agreed upon orders prohibit doral bank from paying dividends to doral financial without obtaining prior written approval from the fdic and federal reserve  and the federal reserve order prohibits doral financial from paying dividends to its stockholders without the prior written approval of the federal reserve 
the fdic and the office of the commissioner lifted their consent order on january  the consent order with the federal reserve remains in effect 
please refer to regulation and supervision banking activities puerto rico regulation  below  for a description of certain restrictions on doral bank s ability to pay dividends under puerto rico law 
fdic insurance assessments the deposits of doral bank are insured by the deposit insurance fund dif of the fdic  and are therefore subject to fdic deposit insurance assessments 

table of contents as mentioned above  the dodd frank act permanently raised the basic limit on deposit insurance by the fdic from  to  the coverage limit is per depositor  per insured depository institution for each account ownership category 
the dodd frank act also set a new minimum dif reserve ratio at of estimated insured deposits 
the fdic is required to attain this ratio by september  in december  the fdic approved a final rule raising its industry target ratio of reserves to insured deposits to  basis points above the statutory minimum  but the fdic does not project that goal to be met until in addition  the dodd frank act will have a significant impact on the calculation of deposit insurance assessment premiums going forward 
specifically  the dodd frank act generally requires the fdic to define the deposit insurance assessment base for an insured depository institution as an amount equal to the institution s average consolidated total assets during the assessment period minus average tangible equity 
the fdic issued a final rule that implements this change to the assessment calculation on february   but has said that the new assessment rate schedule should result in the collection of assessment revenue that is approximately revenue neutral although the amounts that individual depository institutions will pay may change even though the new assessment base under the dodd frank act is larger than the current assessment base 
as presently done under the previous rule  the assessment rate of a depository institution will be determined according to its supervisory ratings and capital levels  with adjustments for the depository institution s unsecured debt and brokered deposits 
the deposit insurance rates for depository institutions under the new rule range from to basis points per of the assessment base average consolidated assets minus average tangible equity 
the new rule became effective for the quarter beginning april   and was reflected in the june  fund balance and the invoices for assessments due september  the fdic rule also provides the fdic s board with the flexibility to adopt actual rates that are higher or lower than the total base assessment rates adopted without notice and comment  if certain conditions are met 
under the previous rule  the amount of the assessment was a function of the institution s risk category  of which there are four  and the assessment base 
an institution s risk category was determined according to its supervisory ratings and capital levels and was used to determine the institution s assessment rate 
the assessment rate for risk categories was calculated according to a formula  which relied on supervisory ratings and either financial ratios or long term debt ratings 
an insured bank s assessment base was determined by the balance of its insured deposits 
because the system was risk based  it allowed banks to pay lower assessments to the fdic as their capital levels and supervisory ratings improve 
by the same token  if these indicators deteriorate  the institution would have to pay higher assessments to the fdic 
under the previous rule  deposit insurance rates for depository institutions ranged from to basis points per of assessable deposits based upon assessment rates that were calculated based upon the depository institution s risk rating as adjusted by its levels of unsecured debt  secured liabilities  and brokered deposits 
under the fdia  the fdic also has the authority to impose special assessments upon insured depository institutions when deemed necessary by the fdic s board 
the fdic adopted a final rule  in may  effective june   that imposed a special assessment of five cents for every on each insured depository institution s assets minus its tier capital as of june   subject to a cap equal to cents per of assessable deposits for the second quarter of on november   the fdic adopted the final rule implementing a prepayment assessment for the fourth quarter of and for all of  and in order to strengthen the cash position of the dif 
our total prepaid assessment was million  which according to the final rule was recorded as a prepaid expense as of december  the prepaid assessment will be amortized and recognized by doral financial as an expense over the period from to as of december  the amortized balance of the prepaid assessment was million 
the deposit insurance funds act of separated the financing corporation assessment to service the interest on its bond obligations from the dif assessments 
the amount assessed on individual institutions by the financing corporation is in addition to the amount  if any  paid for deposit insurance according to the fdic s risk related assessment rate schedules 
the current financing corporation annual assessment rate is to 
table of contents cents per of deposits 
these assessments will continue until the financing corporation bonds mature in as of december   doral bank had an fdic insurance assessment base of approximately billion 
temporary fdic insurance of non interest bearing transaction accounts the dodd frank act amended the fdia to fully insure the amounts deposited in non interest bearing transaction accounts at all insured depository institutions from december  until december  this amendment became effective on december   which was the date that the fdic s former transaction account guarantee tag program terminated 
the new program applies to all insured depository institutions  while the tag program applied to only to insured depository institutions that opted in doral bank had opted in to the tag program 
under the new program  low interest checking now accounts will no longer be eligible for unlimited deposit insurance 
this unlimited insurance coverage for non interest bearing transaction accounts is separate from  and in addition to  the insurance coverage provided to a depositor s other deposit accounts held at an fdic insured institution 
fdic insured depository institutions are not permitted to opt out of this temporary insurance program and the fdic will not charge a separate assessment for this coverage 
community reinvestment under the community reinvestment act cra  each insured depository institution has a continuing and affirmative obligation  consistent with the safe and sound operation of such institution  to help meet the credit needs of its entire community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
the cra does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for such institutions nor does it limit an institution s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community  consistent with the cra 
the cra requires each federal banking agency  in connection with its examination of an insured depository institution  to assess and assign one of four ratings to the institution s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such records into account in its evaluation of certain applications by the institution  including application for charters  branches and other deposit facilities  relocations  mergers  consolidations  and acquisitions of assets or assumptions of liabilities 
the cra also requires that all institutions make public disclosure of their cra ratings 
doral bank received a rating of satisfactory as of the most recent cra report of the fdic 
safety and soundness standards section of the fdia  as amended by fdicia  requires each federal banking agency to prescribe for all insured depository institutions that it supervises safety and soundness standards relating to internal control  information systems and internal audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate exposure  asset growth  compensation  fees and benefits and such other operational and managerial standards as the federal banking agency deems appropriate 
if an insured depository institution fails to meet any of the standards described above  it may be required to submit to the appropriate federal banking agency a plan specifying the steps that will be taken to cure the deficiency 
if the depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan or fails to implement the plan  the appropriate federal banking agency will require the depository institution to correct the deficiency and  until it is corrected  may impose other restrictions on the depository institution  including any of the restrictions applicable under the prompt corrective action provisions of the fdicia 
the fdic and other federal banking agencies have adopted interagency guidelines establishing standards for safety and soundness that  among other things  set forth standards relating to internal controls  information systems and internal audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate exposure  asset growth  employee compensation and benefits  asset growth and earnings 
interagency appraisal and evaluation guidelines in december  the federal banking agencies issued the interagency appraisal and evaluation guidelines 
this guidance  which updated guidance originally issued in  sets forth the minimum regulatory 
table of contents standards for appraisals 
in incorporates previous regulatory issuances affecting appraisals  addresses advances in information technology used in collateral evaluation  and clarifies standards for use of analytical methods and technological tools in developing evaluations 
this guidance also requires institutions to utilize strong internal controls to ensure reliable appraisals and evaluations and periodically update valuations of collaterals for existing real estate loans and transactions 
brokered deposits fdic regulations adopted under fdicia govern the receipt of brokered deposits by insured depository institutions 
under these regulations  a bank cannot accept  roll over or renew brokered deposits which term is defined also to include any deposit with an interest rate more than basis points above certain prevailing rates specified by regulation unless i it is well capitalized  or ii it is adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from the fdic 
a bank that is adequately capitalized may not pay an interest rate on any deposits in excess of basis points over certain prevailing market rates specified by regulation 
there are no such restrictions on a bank that is well capitalized 
doral financial does not believe the brokered deposits regulation has had or will have a material effect on the funding or liquidity of doral bank  which is currently a well capitalized institution 
as of december  and  doral bank had a total of approximately billion and billion of brokered deposits  respectively 
doral bank generally uses brokered deposits as a less costly source of funding 
federal home loan bank system doral bank is a member of the federal home loan bank fhlb system 
the fhlb system consists of twelve regional federal home loan banks governed and regulated by the federal housing finance agency 
the federal home loan banks serve as reserve or credit facilities for member institutions within their assigned regions 
they are funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the fhlb system  and they make loans advances to members in accordance with policies and procedures established by the fhlb system and the board of directors of each regional fhlb 
doral bank is a member of the fhlb of new york fhlb ny and as such is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the fhlb ny for a certain amount  which is calculated in accordance with the requirements set forth in applicable laws and regulations 
doral bank is in compliance with the stock ownership requirements of the fhlb ny 
all loans  advances and other extensions of credit made by the fhlb ny to doral bank are secured by a portion of doral bank s mortgage loan portfolio  certain other investments and the capital stock of the fhlb ny held by doral bank 
activity restrictions on state chartered banks  volcker rule section of the fdia  as amended by fdicia  generally provides that state chartered banks and their subsidiaries are limited in their investments and activities engaged in as principal to those permissible under state law and that are permissible to national banks and their subsidiaries  unless such investments and principal activities are specifically permitted by the fdia or the fdic determines that such activity or investment would pose no significant risk to the dif and the banks are  and continue to be  in compliance with applicable capital standards 
any insured state chartered bank directly or indirectly engaged in any activity that is not permitted for a national bank must cease the impermissible activity 
in october  the fdic and other banking and securities agencies jointly issued a proposed rule implementing the so called volcker rule requirements of section of the dodd frank act 
section prohibits i insured depository institutions  bank holding companies and their affiliates and subsidiaries from engaging in short term proprietary trading of any security  derivative  and certain other financial instruments  subject to certain exceptions  and ii insured depository institutions  bank holding companies and their affiliates and subsidiaries from owning  sponsoring  or having certain relationships with a hedge fund or private equity fund  subject to certain exceptions 
the dodd frank act also prohibits banking entities from entering into any transaction or engaging in any activity that would i involve or result in a material conflict of interest  ii result in a material exposure to high risk assets or high risk trading strategies  iii pose a threat to the safety or soundness of the banking entity  or iv pose a threat to the financial stability of the united states 
the proposed 
table of contents rule clarifies the scope of the dodd frank act s prohibitions and  as contemplated by the statute  provides certain exceptions to these prohibitions 
the proposed rule would require banking entities to establish an internal compliance program that is designed to ensure and monitor compliance with the dodd frank act s prohibitions and restrictions 
usa patriot act of on october   the president of the united states signed into law comprehensive anti terrorism legislation known as the usa patriot act of the usa patriot act 
title iii of the usa patriot act substantially broadened the scope of us anti money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations  creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra territorial jurisdiction of the united states 
the us treasury department treasury has issued a number of regulations implementing the usa patriot act that apply certain of its requirements to financial institutions  including doral bank 
the regulations impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies  procedures and controls to detect  prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing 
among other requirements  the usa patriot act and the related regulations require financial institutions to establish anti money laundering programs that include  at a minimum internal policies  procedures and controls designed to implement and maintain the depository institution s compliance with all of the requirements of the usa patriot act  the bank secrecy act and related laws and regulations  systems and procedures for monitoring and reporting of suspicious transactions and activities  employee training  an independent audit function to test the anti money laundering program  procedures to verify the identity of each customer upon the opening of accounts  and heightened due diligence policies  procedures and controls applicable to certain foreign accounts and relationships 
failure of a financial institution to comply with the usa patriot act s requirements could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution 
doral financial believes that the cost of complying with title iii of the usa patriot act is not likely to be material to doral financial 
doral bank was subject to a consent order with the fdic relating to failure to comply with certain requirements of the bank secrecy act 
the order required doral bank  among other things  to engage an independent consultant to review account and transaction activity from april  through march  to determine compliance with suspicious activity reporting requirements the look back review 
the fdic terminated the consent order on september  since the look back review was still ongoing  doral bank and the fdic agreed to a memorandum of understanding that covered the remaining portion of the look back review 
on june   doral bank received a notification letter from the fdic terminating the memorandum of understanding because the look back review had been completed 
transactions with affiliates and related parties transactions between doral bank and any of its affiliates including doral financial are governed by sections a and b of the federal reserve act 
these sections are important statutory provisions designed to protect a depository institution from transferring to its affiliates the subsidy arising from the institution s access to the federal safety net on deposits 
an affiliate of a bank is any company or entity that controls  is controlled by or is under common control with the bank 
generally  section a limits the extent to which a bank or its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions with any one affiliate to an amount equal to of the bank s capital stock and surplus  and limit such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to of the bank s capital stock and surplus  and requires that all such transactions be on terms that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices 
the term covered transactions includes the making of loans  purchase of or 
table of contents investment in securities issued by the affiliate  purchase of assets  issuance of guarantees and other similar types of transactions 
most loans by a bank to any of its affiliates must be secured by collateral in amounts ranging from to percent of the loan amount  depending on the nature of the collateral 
in addition  section b requires that any covered transaction by a bank with an affiliate and any sale of assets or provision of services to an affiliate must be on terms that are substantially the same  or at least as favorable to the bank  as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies 
regulation w of the federal reserve board comprehensively implements sections a and b 
the regulation unified and updated federal reserve board staff interpretations issued over the years prior to its adoption  incorporated several interpretative proposals such as to clarify when transactions with an unrelated third party will be attributed to an affiliate  and addressed issues arising as a result of the expanded scope of non banking activities engaged in by banks and bank holding companies and authorized for financial holding companies under the gramm leach bliley act 
the dodd frank act also changed the definition of covered transaction in sections a and b and established limitations on asset purchases from insiders 
with respect to the definition of covered transaction  the dodd frank act defines that term to include the acceptance of debt obligations issued by an affiliate as collateral for a bank s loan or extension of credit to another person or company 
in addition  a derivative transaction with an affiliate is now deemed to be a covered transaction to the extent that such a transaction causes a bank or its subsidiary to have a credit exposure to the affiliate 
a separate provision of the dodd frank act states that an insured depository institution may not purchase an asset from  or sell an asset to a bank insider or their related interests unless the transaction is conducted on market terms between the parties  and if the proposed transaction represents more than of the capital stock and surplus of the insured institution  it has been approved in advance by a majority of the institution s non interested directors 
sections g and h of the federal reserve act set forth restrictions on loans by a bank to its executive officers  directors  and principal shareholders

table of contents risks related to the general business environment and our industry difficult market conditions have already affected us and our industry and may continue to adversely affect us 
given that almost all of our business is in puerto rico and the united states and given the degree of interrelation between puerto rico s economy and that of the united states  we are particularly exposed to downturns in the united states economy 
dramatic declines in the united states housing market over the past few years  with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures  unemployment and underemployment  have negatively impacted the credit performance of mortgage loans and resulted in significant write downs of asset values by financial institutions  including government sponsored entities as well as major commercial banks and investment banks 
these write downs  initially of mortgage backed securities but spreading to credit default swaps and other derivative and cash securities  in turn  have caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital from private and government entities  to merge with larger and stronger financial institutions and  in some cases  to fail 
reflecting concern about the stability of the financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties  many lenders and institutional investors reduced or ceased providing funding to borrowers  including other financial institutions 
this market turmoil and tightening of credit led to an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies  lack of consumer confidence  increased market volatility and widespread reduction of business activity generally 
the resulting economic pressure on consumers and lack of confidence in the financial markets has already adversely affected our industry and has and may continue to adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we experienced increased levels of non performing assets and otti charges on our non agency mortgage backed securities as a result of market conditions 
we do not expect that the difficult conditions in the financial markets are likely to improve in the near future 
a worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on us and others in the financial institutions industry 
in particular  we may face the following risks in connection with these events our ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers may be impaired if the models and approaches we use to select  manage  and underwrite our customers become less predictive of future behaviors 
the processes and models we use to estimate losses inherent in our credit exposure requires difficult  subjective  and complex judgments  including forecast of economic conditions and how these economic conditions might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans  which may no longer be capable of accurate estimation and which may  in turn  impact the reliability of the processes and models 
regulatory agency views of market conditions and the effect of market conditions on our borrowers may differ from those of our management  and such variance in views  if any  may contribute to increases in charge offs and loan loss provisions 
our ability to borrow from other financial institutions or to engage in sales of mortgage loans to third parties including mortgage loan securitization transactions with government sponsored entities on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected by further disruptions in the capital markets or other events  including deteriorating investor expectations 
competition in our industry could intensify as a result of increasing consolidation of financial services companies in connection with current market conditions 
we expect to face increased regulation of our industry 
compliance with such regulation may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities 
we may be required to pay in the future significantly higher fdic assessments to insure our deposits if market conditions do not improve or if market conditions deteriorate 
we may face higher credit losses because of federal or state legislation or regulatory action that either i reduces the amount that our borrowers are required to pay us  or ii limits our ability to foreclose on properties or collateral or makes foreclosures less economically viable 

table of contents if current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen  our ability to access capital and our business  financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 
adverse credit market conditions may affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs  unforeseen disruptions in the brokered deposits market could compromise our liquidity position 
the credit markets  although recovering  have experienced extreme volatility and disruption in recent years 
at times during the past few years  the volatility and disruptions reached unprecedented levels 
in some cases  the markets have exerted downward pressure on availability of liquidity and credit capacity of certain issuers  particularly for non investment grade issuers like us 
we need liquidity to  among other things  pay our operating expenses  interest on our debt and dividends on our preferred stock if dividends are declared and paid  maintain our lending activities and replace certain maturing liabilities 
without sufficient liquidity  we may be forced to curtail our operations 
the availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions  the general availability of credit and our credit capacity 
our cash flows and financial condition could be materially affected by continued disruptions in the financial markets 
a relatively large portion of our funding is retail brokered deposits issued by doral bank 
our total brokered deposits as of december  were billion 
an unforeseen disruption in the brokered deposits market  stemming from factors such as legal  regulatory or financial risks  could adversely affect our ability to fund a portion of our operations and or meet obligations 
recent and or future us credit downgrades or changes in outlook by major credit rating agencies may have an adverse effect on financial markets  including financial institutions and the financial industry 
on august   standard and poor s downgraded the united states long term debt rating from its aaa rating to aa 
on august   standard and poor s downgraded from aaa to aa the credit ratings of certain long term debt instruments issued by fannie mae and freddie mac and other united states government agencies linked to long term united states debt 
it is difficult to predict the effect of these actions  or any future downgrades or changes in outlook by standard poor s or either of the other two major credit rating agencies 
however  these events could impact the trading market for united states government securities  including agency securities  and the securities markets more broadly and consequently could impact the value and liquidity of financial assets  including assets in our investment portfolio 
these actions could also create broader financial turmoil and uncertainty  which may negatively affect the global banking system and limit the availability of funding  including borrowing under repurchase agreements  at reasonable terms 
in turn  this could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  financial condition and results of operations 
we have been and could continue to be negatively affected by adverse economic conditions 
the united states and other countries recently faced a severe economic crisis  including a major recession 
these adverse economic conditions have negatively affected  and are likely to continue to negatively affect for some time  our assets  including our loans and securities portfolios  capital levels  results of operations and financial condition 
in response to the economic crisis  the united states and other governments established a variety of programs and policies designed to mitigate the effects of the crisis 
these programs and policies appear to have stabilized the severe financial crisis that occurred in the second half of  but the extent to which these programs and policies will assist in an economic recovery or may lead to adverse consequences  whether anticipated or unanticipated  is still unclear 
if these programs and policies are ineffective in bringing about an economic recovery or result in substantial adverse developments  the economic conditions may again become more severe  or adverse economic conditions may continue for a substantial period of time 
in addition  economic uncertainty that may result from the recent downgrading of united states long term debt  from the fiscal imbalances in federal  state and local municipal finances combined with the political difficulties in resolving these imbalances  and from the debt and other economic problems of several european countries  may directly or indirectly adversely impact economic conditions faced by us and our customers 
any increase in the severity or duration of adverse economic conditions  including a double dip recession in the united states or a further delay in the economic recovery of puerto rico  would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents our credit quality may continue to be adversely affected by puerto rico s current economic conditions and the fiscal condition of the commonwealth of puerto rico 
our business activities and credit exposure are concentrated in puerto rico 
consequently  our financial condition and results of operations are highly dependent on economic conditions in puerto rico 
puerto rico s economy is currently in a recession that began in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year that ended june   a fiscal year in which puerto rico s gross national product grew by only 
puerto rico s real gross national product decreased by   and  respectively  for fiscal years   and according to the puerto rico planning board s latest projections made in march  puerto rico s real gross national product was projected to have contracted by during fiscal year puerto rico s real gross national product for fiscal year  however  is projected to grow by 
according to data published by the puerto rico department of labor  the number of persons employed in puerto rico during fiscal year averaged  a decrease of compared to the previous fiscal year  and the unemployment rate averaged 
during the first four months of fiscal year  total employment averaged  a decline of with respect to the same period of the prior fiscal year  and the unemployment rate averaged 
since  the government of puerto rico has experienced a structural imbalance between recurring government revenues and total expenditures 
the structural imbalance was exacerbated during fiscal years and  with recurring government expenditures significantly exceeding recurring government revenues 
prior to fiscal year  the puerto rico government bridged the deficit resulting from the structural imbalance through the use of non recurring measures  such as borrowing from the government development bank for puerto rico or in the bond market  postponing the payment of various government expenses  such as payments to suppliers and utilities providers  and other one time measures such as the use of derivatives and borrowings collateralized with government assets such as real estate and uncollected general fund revenues 
since march  the government has taken multiple steps to address and resolve the structural imbalance 
for fiscal year  the deficit was approximately billion  consisting of the difference between revenues and expenses for such fiscal year 
for fiscal year  the deficit was approximately billion and the deficit for fiscal year was approximately billion 
the deficit for fiscal year has been estimated at million 
measures that the government of puerto rico has implemented to reduce the deficit have included reducing expenses  including public sector employment through layoffs of employees 
since the government of puerto rico is the largest source of employment in puerto rico  these measures have had the effect of increasing unemployment and could have the effect of intensifying the current recessionary cycle 
on august   moody s downgraded the general obligation bond rating of the commonwealth of puerto rico from a to baa with a negative outlook 
the downgrade also applies to those ratings that are determined by or linked to that of the general obligation bond rating of the commonwealth of puerto rico 
moody s based its decision on its strong concerns with the continued deterioration of the severely underfunded government retirement systems  continued weak economic trends  and weak finances  with a historical trend of funding budget gaps with borrowings 
a payment or other material default by the government of puerto rico or any of its agencies  public corporations or instrumentalities with respect to their municipal bond or note obligations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the current state of the puerto rico economy and continued uncertainty in the public and private sectors has had an adverse effect on the credit quality of our loan portfolios and reduced the level of our originations in puerto rico 
the continuation of the economic slowdown would cause those adverse effects to continue  as delinquency rates may continue to increase in the short term  until sustainable growth of the puerto rico economy resumes 
also  potential reduction in consumer spending as a result of continued recessionary conditions may also impact growth in our other interest and non interest revenue sources 

table of contents a prolonged economic slowdown or decline in the residential real estate market in the united states mainland and or puerto rico and an increase in unemployment in the united states mainland and or puerto rico could continue to adversely affect our results of operations 
the residential mortgage loan origination business has historically been cyclical  enjoying periods of strong growth and profitability followed by periods of shrinking volumes and industry wide losses 
the market for residential mortgage loan originations is currently in decline and this trend could also reduce the level of mortgage loans we may produce in the future and adversely affect our business 
during periods of rising interest rates  refinancing originations for many mortgage products tend to decrease as the economic incentives for borrowers to refinance their existing mortgage loans are reduced 
in addition  the residential mortgage loan origination business is impacted by home values 
over the past four years  residential real estate values in many areas of the united states have decreased significantly  which has led to lower volumes and higher losses across the industry  adversely impacting our mortgage business 
the actual rates of delinquencies  foreclosures and losses on loans have been higher during the recent economic slowdown 
rising unemployment and declines in housing prices have had a greater negative effect on the ability of borrowers to repay their mortgage loans 
any sustained period of increased delinquencies  foreclosures or losses could continue to harm our ability to sell loans  the prices we receive for loans  the values of mortgage loans held for sale or residual interests in securitizations  which could continue to harm our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  any additional material decline in real estate values would further weaken the collateral loan to value ratios and increase the possibility of loss if a borrower defaults 
in such event  we will be subject to the risk of loss on such loan arising from borrower defaults to the extent not covered by third party credit enhancement 
our business concentration in puerto rico imposes risks 
we conduct our operations in a geographically concentrated area  as our main market is in puerto rico 
this imposes risks from lack of diversification in the geographical portfolio 
our financial condition and results of operations are highly dependent on the economic conditions of puerto rico  where adverse political or economic developments or natural disasters  among other things  could affect the volume of loan originations  increase the level of non performing assets  increase the rate of foreclosure losses and reduce the value of our loans and loan servicing portfolio 
the soundness of other financial institutions could affect us 
our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions 
financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading  clearing  counterparty and other relationships 
we have exposure to different industries and counterparties  and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry  including brokers and dealers  commercial banks  investment banks  investment companies and other institutional clients 
in certain of these transactions  we are required to post collateral to secure our obligations to the counterparties 
in the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding involving one of such counterparties  we may experience delays in recovering the assets posted as collateral or may incur a loss to the extent that the counterparty was holding collateral in excess of the obligation to such counterparty 
many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by our counterparty or client 
in addition  our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us 
any such losses could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
monetary policies and regulations of the federal reserve could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition to being affected by general economic conditions  our earnings and growth are affected by the policies of the federal reserve 
an important function of the federal reserve is to regulate the money supply and credit conditions 
among the instruments used by the federal reserve to implement these objectives are 
table of contents open market operations in us government securities  adjustments of the discount rate and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits 
these instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution of credit  bank loans  investments and deposits 
their use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits 
on january   the member agencies of the federal financial institutions examination council  which includes the federal reserve and the fdic  issued an interest rate risk advisory reminding banks to maintain sound practices for managing interest rate risk  particularly in the current environment of historically low short term interest rates 
the monetary policies and regulations of the federal reserve have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
the effects of such policies upon our business  financial condition and results of operations may be adverse 
our income and cash flows depend to a great extent on the difference between the interest rates earned on interest earning assets such as loans and investment securities  and the interest rates paid on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings 
these rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control  including general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies in particular  the federal reserve 
changes in monetary policy  including changes in interest rates  will influence the origination of loans  the prepayment speed of loans  the value of loans  investment securities and mortgage servicing assets  the purchase of investments  the generation of deposits  and the rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits or other sources of funding 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act will affect our business 
on july   president obama signed into law the dodd frank act 
the legislation made significant structural reforms to the financial services industry 
the legislation  among other things  did the following i establishes a bureau of consumer financial protection having broad authority to regulate providers of credit  savings and other consumer financial products and services  narrows the scope of federal preemption of state consumer laws and expands the authority of state attorneys general to bring actions to enforce federal consumer protection legislation  ii creates a structure to regulate systematically important financial companies  and provides regulators with the power to require such companies to sell or transfer assets and terminate activities if the regulators determine the size or the scope of the activities of such companies pose a threat to the safety and soundness of such companies or the financial stability of the united states  iii requires more comprehensive regulation of the over the counter derivatives market  including providing for more strict capital and margin requirements  the central clearing of standardized over the counter derivatives  and heightened supervision of all over the counter derivatives dealers and major market participants  iv limits the ability of banking entities to engage in certain proprietary trading activities and restricts their ownership of  investment in or sponsorship of hedge funds and private equity funds  v restricts the interchange fees payable on debit card transactions  vi abolishes the office of thrift supervision ots and transfers its functions and responsibilities regarding the supervision of federal savings banks to the office of the comptroller of the currency occ  vii strengthens the regulatory oversight of securities and capital markets activities by the sec and enhances the safety and soundness of the securitization process  including a requirement that securitizers and originators retain a portion of the credit risk for any asset that they securitize or originate  viii permanently increases the federal deposit insurance from  to  permits depository institutions to pay interest on demand deposit accounts such as commercial checking accounts and permits de novo interstate branching by federal and state depository institutions alike  and 
table of contents ix strengthens existing laws and regulations applicable to public companies governing corporate accountability  giving shareholders say on pay and other corporate governance rights  and imposes limitations on certain executive compensation practices 
some of the provisions of the legislation have already become effective 
other provisions will have extended implementation periods and delayed effective dates  and will be required to be implemented through regulatory action of various federal regulatory authorities 
because many of the provisions require future regulatory actions for their implementation  the ultimate impact of the legislation on the financial services industry and on our business  are not completely known at this time 
the implementation of many of the provisions of the legislation will affect our business and are expected to add new regulatory risk and compliance burdens and costs on the financial services industry and us 
the implementation of this legislation could result in loss of revenue  limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities we might otherwise consider engaging in  impact the value of some of the assets we hold  require us to change certain of our business practices  impose additional costs on us  establish more stringent capital  liquidity and leverage ratio requirements  or otherwise adversely affect our business 
we operate within a highly regulated industry and our business and results are significantly affected by the regulations to which we are subject  changes in statutes and regulations could adversely affect us 
we operate within a highly regulated environment 
the regulations to which we are subject will continue to have a significant impact on our operations and the degree to which we can grow and be profitable 
certain regulators which supervise us have significant power in reviewing our operations and approving our business practices 
these powers include the ability to place limitations or conditions on activities in which we engage or intend to engage 
particularly in recent years  our businesses have experienced increased regulation and regulatory scrutiny  often requiring additional resources 
if we do not comply with governmental regulations  we may subject to fines  penalties  lawsuits or material restrictions on our businesses in the jurisdiction where the violation occurred  which may adversely affect our business operations 
in addition  new proposals for legislation continue to be introduced in the united states congress or the puerto rico legislature that could further increase regulation of the financial services industry and impose restrictions on the operations and general ability of firms within the industry to conduct business consistent with historical practices 
federal and state regulatory agencies also frequently adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied 
we cannot predict the substance or impact of any change in regulation  whether by regulators or as a result of legislation enacted by the united states congress or by the puerto rico legislature  or in the way such statutory or regulatory requirements are interpreted or enforced 
compliance with such current and potential regulation and scrutiny may significantly increase our costs  impede the efficiency of our internal business practices  require us to increase our regulatory capital and limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities in an efficient manner 
further increases in the fdic insurance assessment premiums or required reserves may have a significant impact on us 
the fdic insures deposits at fdic insured depository institutions up to certain limits 
the fdic charges insured depository institutions premiums to maintain the deposit insurance fund the dif 
current economic conditions have resulted in higher bank failures and expectations of future bank failures 
in the event of a bank failure  the fdic takes control of a failed bank and ensures payment of deposits up to insured limits which were permanently increased to  by the dodd frank act using the resources of the dif 
the fdic is required by law to maintain adequate funding of the dif  and the fdic may increase premium assessments to maintain such funding 
on november   the fdic adopted the final rule implementing a prepayment assessment for the fourth quarter of and for all of  and in order to strengthen the cash position of the dif 
our total prepaid assessment was million  which according to the final rule was recorded as a prepaid expense as of december  the prepaid assessment will be amortized and recognized by doral financial as an 
table of contents expense over the period from to as of december  the unamortized balance of the prepaid assessment was million 
the dodd frank act requires the fdic to increase the dif s reserves against future losses  which will necessitate increased deposit insurance premiums that are expected to be borne primarily by institutions with assets of greater than billion 
in october  the fdic addressed plans to bolster the dif by increasing the required reserve ratio for the industry to percent ratio of reserves to insured deposits by september   as required by the dodd frank act 
in december  the fdic approved a final rule raising its industry target ratio of reserves to insured deposits to percent  basis points above the statutory minimum  but the fdic does not project that goal to be met until on february   the fdic approved a final rule that amended the deposit insurance assessment regulations 
the final rule implemented a provision in the dodd frank act that changes the assessment base for deposit insurance premiums from one based on domestic deposits to one based on average consolidated total assets minus average tier capital 
the final rule also changed the assessment rate schedules for insured depository institutions so that approximately the same amount of revenue would be collected under the new assessment base as would be collected under the then current rate schedule and the schedules previously proposed by the fdic in october the final rule also revised the risk based assessment system for all large insured depository institutions generally  institutions with at least billion in total assets 
under the final rule  the fdic will use a scorecard method to calculate assessment rates for all large insured depository institutions 
as noted by the fdic in the final rule it adopted  the final rule should keep the overall amount collected from the industry very close to unchanged  although the amounts that individual institutions pay will be different 
the new large bank pricing system is expected to result in higher assessments for banks with high risk asset concentrations  less stable balance sheet liquidity  or potentially higher loss severity in the event of failure 
we are generally unable to control the amount of assessments that we are required to pay for fdic insurance 
if there are additional bank or financial institution failures  or if our risk rating deteriorates for purposes of determining the level of our fdic insurance assessments  we may be required to pay even higher fdic insurance assessments than the recently increased levels 
any future increases in fdic insurance assessments may materially adversely affect our results of operations 
the consolidation of the puerto rico banking industry as a result of bank failures in may adversely affect us 
in april  the fdic closed three puerto rico banks and sold some of their assets and liabilities to other banks in puerto rico 
in the future  there may be additional bank failures  mergers and acquisitions in our industry 
any business combinations could significantly alter industry conditions and competition within the puerto rico banking industry and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the strategies adopted by the fdic and the three acquiring banks in connection with some of the residential  construction and commercial real estate loans acquired may adversely affect residential and commercial real estate values in puerto rico 
this in turn may adversely affect the value of some of our residential  construction and commercial real estate loans  and our ability to sell or restructure some of our residential  construction and commercial real estate loans 
changes in accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board or other standard setting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements 
our financial statements are subject to the application of generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap  which are periodically revised and or expanded 
accordingly  from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards and updates thereto issued by the financial accounting standards board the fasb 
the impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet implemented is disclosed by us in our filings with the sec 
an assessment of proposed standards and updates thereto is not provided as such proposals are still subject to change 
it is possible that future accounting standards and updates thereto that we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents risks related to our business deteriorating credit quality has adversely impacted us and may continue to adversely impact us 
we have experienced a downturn in credit quality since our credit quality has continued to be under pressure during and as a result of continued recessionary conditions in puerto rico and the recent slow down in consumer activity and economic growth in the united states that have led to  among other things  higher unemployment levels  much lower absorption rates for new residential construction projects and further declines in property values 
we expect that credit conditions and the performance of our loan portfolio will continue to be under pressure in the near future 
our business depends on the creditworthiness of our customers and counterparties and the value of the assets securing our loans or underlying our investments 
if the credit quality of the customer base materially decreases  if the risk profile of a market  industry or group of customers changes materially  our business  financial condition  allowance levels  asset impairments  liquidity  capital and results of operations could be adversely affected 
our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual losses  and we may be required to increase our allowance  which may affect our capital  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to risk of loss from loan defaults and foreclosures with respect to the loans that we originate or purchase 
we establish an allowance for loan and lease losses at a level estimated as the amount of incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the related financial statement date based upon analysis of past portfolio default trends  severity experience  and fair value estimates  and record a provision for loan and lease losses which adjusts the allowance for loan and lease loss balance to the estimated amount as a charge to current period income 
we establish a provision for loan losses  which leads to reductions in our income from operations  in order to maintain our allowance for inherent loan losses at a level which we deem to be appropriate based upon an assessment of the quality of our loan portfolio 
although we strive to utilize our best judgment in providing for loan losses  we may fail to accurately estimate the level of inherent loan losses or may have to increase our provision in the future as a result of new information regarding existing loans  future increases in non performing loans  changes in economic and other conditions affecting borrowers or for other reasons beyond our control 
in addition  bank regulatory agencies  such as fdic and the office of the commissioner  periodically review the adequacy of our allowance for loan and lease losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses or loan charge offs  based on judgments different from those of our management 
the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan and lease losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates and judgments regarding credit risks and future trends  all of which may undergo substantial changes 
if our estimates prove to be incorrect  our allowance for loan and lease losses may not be sufficient to cover losses in our loan portfolio and our expense relating to the additional provision for credit losses could increase substantially 
any such increase in our provision for loan losses would have an adverse effect on our future financial condition and results of operations 
changes in collateral values of properties located in distressed economies may require increased reserves 
substantially all of our loans are located within the boundaries of the united states economy 
whether the collateral for a loan is located in puerto rico or the united states mainland  the performance of our loan portfolio and the collateral value backing the loan transactions are dependent upon the performance of and conditions within each specific real estate market 
puerto rico entered its sixth straight year of economic recession in sustained weak economic conditions that have affected puerto rico and the united states over the last several years have resulted in declines in collateral values 
we measure the impairment of a loan based on the fair value of the collateral  if collateral dependent  which is generally obtained from appraisals 
updated appraisals are requested when we determine that loans are 
table of contents impaired and are updated annually thereafter 
in addition  appraisals are also obtained for certain residential mortgage loans on a spot basis based on specific characteristics such as delinquency levels  age of the appraisal and ltv ratios 
the appraised value of the collateral may decrease or we may not be able to recover collateral at its appraised value 
in the absence of a current appraisal  doral estimates the change in collateral value since the most recent appraisal using changes in value over similar time periods experienced on appraisals received 
a significant decline in collateral valuations for collateral dependent loans may require increases in our specific provision for loan losses and an increase in the general valuation allowance 
any such increase would have an adverse effect on our future financial condition and results of operations 
interest rate shifts may reduce net interest income 
shifts in short term interest rates may reduce net interest income  which is the principal component of our earnings 
net interest income is the difference between the amounts received by us on our interest earning assets and the interest paid by us on our interest bearing liabilities 
when interest rates rise  the rate of interest we pay on our liabilities generally rises more quickly than the rate of interest that we receive on our interest bearing assets  which may cause our profits to decrease 
the impact on earnings is more adverse when the slope of the yield curve flattens  that is  when short term interest rates increase more than long term interest rates or when long term interest rates decrease more than short term interest rates 
increases in interest rates may reduce the value of our holdings of securities and demand for our mortgage and other loans 
fixed rate securities acquired by us are generally subject to decreases in market value when interest rates rise  which may require recognition of a loss eg  the identification of other than temporary impairment on our investments portfolio  thereby adversely affecting our results of operations 
market related reductions in value also influence our ability to finance these securities 
higher interest rates also increase the cost of mortgage and other loans to consumers and businesses and may reduce demand for such loans  which may negatively impact our profits by reducing the amount of our loan origination income 
doral financial and doral bank are subject to the supervision and regulation of various banking regulators and have entered into consent orders with these regulators  and these regulators could take additional actions against doral financial or doral bank 
as a regulated financial services firm  our good standing with our regulators is of fundamental importance to the continuation and growth of our businesses 
doral financial is subject to supervision and regulation by the federal reserve and the office of the commissioner  and doral bank is subject to supervision and regulation by the fdic  the office of the commissioner and the state banking regulatory authorities of the states in which it has operations 
federal banking regulators  in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties  have significant discretion and power to initiate enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices 
the enforcement powers available to federal banking regulators include  among others  the ability to assess civil monetary penalties  to issue cease and desist or removal orders  to require written agreements and to initiate injunctive actions 
doral financial and doral bank have entered into consent orders with the federal reserve  the fdic and the office of the commissioner  which  among other things  prohibited doral bank from paying dividends to the parent company  prohibited doral financial from paying dividends to its common and preferred shareholders without regulatory approval  and required doral bank to take various actions to ensure compliance with the provisions of the bank secrecy act 
while the fdic and the office of the commissioner have lifted their consent orders  these banking regulators could take further action with respect to doral financial or doral bank and  if any such further action were taken  such action could have a material adverse effect on doral financial 
doral financial s consent order with the federal reserve is still in effect and doral financial s banking regulators could take additional actions to protect doral bank or to ensure that the holding company remains as a source of financial and managerial strength to doral bank  and such action could have adverse effects on doral financial or its stockholders 

table of contents doral financial and doral bank are subject to regulatory capital adequacy and other supervisory guidelines  and if we fail to meet those guidelines our business and financial condition would be adversely affected 
under regulatory capital adequacy guidelines and other regulatory requirements  doral financial and doral bank must meet guidelines that include quantitative measures of assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items  subject to quantitative judgments by regulators regarding components  risk weightings and other factors 
supervisory guidelines also address  among other things  asset quality and liquidity 
if either doral financial or doral bank fail to meet these minimum capital adequacy requirements or any other supervisory and regulatory requirements  our business and financial condition will be adversely affected 
a failure to meet regulatory capital adequacy guidelines  among other things  would affect doral bank s ability to accept or rollover brokered deposits and could result in supervisory actions by federal and or puerto rico banking authorities 
the hedging transactions that we enter into may not be effective in managing the exposure to interest rate risk 
we use derivatives  to a limited extent  to manage part of our exposure to market risk caused by changes in interest rates 
the derivative instruments that we may use also have their own risks  which include i basis risk  which is the risk of loss associated with variations in the spread between the asset yield and funding and or hedge cost  ii credit or default risk  which is the risk of insolvency or other inability of the counterparty to a particular transaction to perform its obligations  and iii legal risk  which is the risk that we are unable to enforce the terms of such instruments 
all or any of these risks could expose us to losses 
management has identified several material weaknesses in doral financial s internal control over financial reporting 
doral financial s management has concluded that the company s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of december   due to several material weaknesses described in this annual report on form k 
a discussion of the material weaknesses that have been identified by management can be found in item a of part ii of this annual report on form k 
each material weakness results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected 
doral financial s management  with the oversight of the audit committee  will complete the work necessary to remedy the identified material weaknesses in the company s internal control over financial reporting as expeditiously as possible 
our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented  our risk management policies and procedures may be inadequate and operational risk could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 
we may fail to identify and manage risks related to a variety of aspects of our business  including  but not limited to  operational risk  interest rate risk  trading risk  fiduciary risk  legal and compliance risk  liquidity risk and credit risk 
we have adopted various controls  procedures  policies and systems to monitor and manage risk 
if our risk management controls  procedures  policies and systems  including those designed to protect our networks  systems  computers and data from attack  damage or unauthorized access  were to fail or be circumvented  we could incur losses or suffer reputational damage or find ourselves out of compliance with applicable regulatory mandates or expectations 
some of our methods for managing risks and exposures are based upon the use of observed historical market behavior or statistics based upon historical models 
as a result  these methods may not fully predict future exposures  which could be significantly greater than our historical measures indicate 
other risk management methods depend upon the evaluation of information regarding markets  clients or other matters that is publicly available or otherwise accessible to us 
this information may not always be accurate  complete  up to date or properly evaluated 
we may also be subject to disruptions from external events that are wholly or partially beyond our control  which could cause delays or disruptions to operational functions  including information processing and financial 
table of contents market settlement functions 
in addition  our customers  vendors and counterparties could suffer from such events 
should these events affect us  or the customers  vendors or counterparties with which we conduct business  our consolidated results of operations could be adversely affected 
when we record balance sheet reserves for probable loss contingencies related to operational losses  we may be unable to accurately estimate our potential exposure  and any reserves we establish to cover operational losses may not be sufficient to cover our actual financial exposure  which may have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition for the periods in which we recognize the losses 
a breach in the security of our systems could disrupt our business  result in the disclosure of confidential information  damage our reputation and create significant financial and legal exposure for us 
our businesses are dependent on our ability and the ability of our third party service providers to process  record and monitor a large number of transactions 
if the financial  accounting  data processing or other operating systems and facilities fail to operate properly  become disabled  experience security breaches or have other significant shortcomings  we could be materially adversely affected 
although we and our third party service providers devote significant resources to maintain and regularly upgrade our systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of computer systems  software  networks and other technology assets and the confidentiality  integrity and availability of information belonging to us and our customers  there is no assurance that our security systems and those of our third party service providers will provide absolute security 
financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems  some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information  destroy data  disable or degrade service  or sabotage systems  often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware  cyber attacks and other means 
despite our efforts and those of our third party service providers to ensure the integrity of these systems  it is possible that we or our third party service providers may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types  especially because techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched  and because security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources 
a successful breach of the security of our systems or those of our third party service providers could cause serious negative consequences to us  including significant disruption of our operations  misappropriation of our confidential information or the confidential information of our customers  or damage to our computers or operating systems  and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws  financial loss to us or to our customers  loss in confidence in our security measures  customer dissatisfaction  litigation exposure  and harm to our reputation  all of which could have a material adverse effect on us 
the preparation of our financial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make significant estimates that affect our financial statements 
four of doral financial s most critical estimates are the level of the allowance for loan and lease losses  the valuation of mortgage servicing rights  the valuation of the interest only securities  and the amount of its deferred tax asset 
due to the inherent nature of these estimates we may significantly increase the allowance for loan and lease losses and or sustain credit losses that are significantly higher than the provided allowance  and may recognize a significant provision for impairment of our mortgage servicing rights or interest only securities 
if doral financial s allowance for loan and lease losses turns out to be insufficient to cover actual losses in our loan portfolio  our business  financial condition  including our liquidity and capital  and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
additionally  in the future  doral financial may have to increase its allowance for loan and lease losses  which could have a material adverse effect on its capital and results of operations 
as of december   we had a deferred tax asset of approximately million 
the deferred tax asset is net of a valuation allowance of million 
the realization of our deferred tax asset ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income to realize the value of this asset 
due to significant estimates utilized in establishing the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances  it is reasonably possible that we will be required to record adjustments to the valuation allowance 
table of contents in future reporting periods 
our results of operations would be negatively impacted if we determine that increases to our deferred tax asset valuation allowance are required in a future reporting period 
governmental agencies that have supervisory authority over the company and doral bank can review the quality of our tier capital and may determine to reduce all or a portion of the increase to our tier capital caused by our agreement with the commonwealth of puerto rico regarding our deferred tax asset 
we recently entered into an agreement with the commonwealth of puerto rico in which the commonwealth of puerto rico recognized a prepayment of income taxes of approximately million from us relating to our past overpayment of taxes 
we believe that this agreement will result in an increase in our reported tier regulatory capital by approximately million 
the federal reserve and the federal deposit insurance corporation have supervisory oversight authority over the company and doral bank  including the quality of our tier i regulatory capital  and as such there can be no assurance that the federal deposit insurance corporation or federal reserve may not seek to reduce in the future our tier regulatory capital including the increase caused by the agreement with the commonwealth of puerto rico 
if either regulatory agency reduces our tier regulatory capital our operations may be materially adversely effected 
defective and repurchased loans may harm our business and financial condition 
in connection with the sale and securitization of mortgage loans  we are generally required to make a variety of customary representations and warranties regarding us and the loans being sold or securitized 
our obligations with respect to these representations and warranties are generally outstanding for the life of the loan  and they relate to  among other things compliance with laws and regulations  underwriting standards  the accuracy of information in the loan documents and loan file  and the characteristics and enforceability of the loan 
a loan that does not comply with these representations and warranties may take longer to sell  may impact our ability to obtain third party financing for the loan  and be unsalable or salable only at a significant discount 
if such a loan is sold before we detect a noncompliance  we may be obligated to repurchase the loan and bear any associated loss directly  or we may be obligated to indemnify the purchaser against any such loss  either of which could reduce our cash available for operations and liquidity 
our management believes that it has established controls to ensure that loans are originated in accordance with the secondary market s requirements  but mistakes may be made  or certain employees may deliberately violate our lending policies 
we seek to minimize repurchases and losses from defective loans by correcting flaws  if possible  and selling or re selling such loans 
we do not have a reserve on our financial statements for possible losses related to repurchases resulting from representation and warranty violations because we do not expect any such losses to be significant 
losses associated with defective loans may adversely impact our results of operations or financial condition 
we are exposed to credit risk from mortgage loans held pending sale and mortgage loans that have been sold subject to recourse arrangements 
we are generally at risk for mortgage loan defaults from the time we fund a loan until the time the loan is sold or securitized into a mortgage backed security 
in the past  we retained  through recourse arrangements  part of the credit risk on sales of mortgage loans that did not qualify for gnma  fnma or fhlmc sale or exchange programs and consequently may suffer losses on these loans 
we suffer losses on these loans when the proceeds from a foreclosure sale of the property underlying a defaulted mortgage loan are less than the outstanding principal balance of the loan and the costs of holding and disposing of the related property 
we estimate the fair value of the retained recourse obligation or of any liability incurred at the time of sale  and include such obligation with the net proceeds from the sale  resulting in lower gain on sale recognition 
we evaluate the fair 
table of contents value of our recourse obligation based on historical losses from foreclosure and disposition of mortgage loans adjusted for expectations of changes in portfolio behavior and market environment 
we are subject to risks in servicing loans for others 
our profitability may also be adversely affected by mortgage loan delinquencies and defaults on mortgage loans that we service for third parties 
under many of our servicing contracts  we must advance all or part of the scheduled payments to the owner of an outstanding mortgage loan  even when mortgage loan payments are delinquent 
in addition  in order to protect their liens on mortgaged properties  owners of mortgage loans usually require that we  as servicer  pay mortgage and hazard insurance and tax payments on schedule even if sufficient escrow funds are not available 
we generally recover our advances from the mortgage owner or from liquidation proceeds when the mortgage loan is foreclosed 
however  in the interim  we must absorb the cost of the funds we advance during the time the advance is outstanding 
we must also bear the costs of attempting to collect on delinquent and defaulted mortgage loans 
in addition  if a default is not cured  the mortgage loan will be canceled as part of the foreclosure proceedings and we will not receive any future servicing income with respect to that loan 
as a result of our credit ratings  we may be subjected to increased collateral requirements and other measures that could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
we have previously sold or securitized mortgage loans in transactions with fnma and other counterparties subject to partial or full recourse 
as of december   the maximum contractual exposure to us if we were required to purchase all loans sold subject to partial or full recourse was billion  billion of which consisted of exposure to fnma 
our contractual agreements with fnma authorize fnma to require us to post additional collateral to secure our recourse obligations with fnma  and fnma has the contractual right to request collateral for the full amount of our recourse obligations when  as now  we do not maintain an investment grade rating 
in january  we agreed to post with fnma million in collateral to secure our recourse obligations 
in addition  certain of our servicing agreements  such as those with fnma  fhlmc  and gnma  contain provisions triggered by changes in our financial condition or failure to maintain required credit ratings 
we do not currently maintain the credit ratings required by gnma and possibly other counterparties  which may result in increased collateral requirements and or require us to engage a substitute fund custodian  or could result in termination of our servicing rights 
termination of our servicing rights  requirements to post additional collateral or the loss of custodian funds could reduce our liquidity and have an adverse impact on our operating results 
our ability to sell loans and other mortgage products to government sponsored entities could be impacted by changes in our financial condition or the historical performance of our mortgage products 
our ability to sell mortgage products to government sponsored entities gses  such as fnma  fhlmc and gnma  depends  among other things  on our financial condition and the historical performance of our mortgage products 
to protect our ability to continue to sell mortgage products to gnma and other gses  we have and may in the future repurchase defaulted loans from such counterparties 
during and  we repurchased million and million  respectively  of defaulted fha guaranteed loans from gnma 
any such repurchases in the future may negatively impact our liquidity and operating results 
termination of our ability to sell mortgage products to the gses would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we may engage in fdic assisted transactions  which could present additional risks to our business 
we may have opportunities to acquire the assets and liabilities of failed banks in fdic assisted transactions 
although these transactions typically provide for fdic assistance to an acquirer to mitigate certain risks  such as sharing exposure to loan losses and providing indemnification against certain liabilities of the failed institution  we would still be subject to many of the same risks we would face in acquiring another bank in a negotiated transaction  including risks associated with maintaining customer relationships and failure to realize the anticipated acquisition benefits in the amounts and within the timeframes we expect 

table of contents in addition  because these transactions are structured in a manner that would not allow us the time and access to information normally associated with preparing for and evaluating a negotiated transaction  we may face additional risk in fdic assisted transactions  including additional strain on management resources  management of problem loans  problems related to integration of personnel and operating systems and impact to our capital resources requiring us to raise additional capital 
we may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with fdic assisted transactions 
our inability to overcome these risks could have a material effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may fail to retain and attract key employees and management personnel 
our success has been and will continue to be influenced by our ability to retain and attract key employees and management personnel  including senior and middle management 
our ability to attract and retain key employees and management personnel may be adversely affected as a result of the workload and stress associated with our business transformation efforts  and related regulatory risks and uncertainties  the consolidation of the puerto rico banking industry  or by additional work relating to any potential or actual acquisition 
competition with other financial institutions could adversely affect the profitability of our operations 
we face significant competition from other financial institutions  many of which have significantly greater assets  capital and other resources 
as a result  many of our competitors have advantages in conducting certain businesses and providing certain services 
this competitive environment could force us to increase the rates we offer on deposits or lower the rates we charge on loans and  consequently  could adversely affect the profitability of our operations 
damage to our reputation could damage our businesses 
maintaining a positive reputation for doral financial is critical to our ability to attract and maintain customers  investors and employees 
damage to our reputation can therefore cause significant harm to our business and prospects 
harm to our reputation can arise from numerous sources  including  among others  employee misconduct  litigation or regulatory outcomes  failing to deliver minimum standards of service and quality  compliance failures  unethical behavior  and the activities of customers and counterparties 
negative publicity regarding doral financial  whether or not true  may also result in harm to our prospects 
we must respond to rapid technological changes  and these changes may be more difficult or expensive than anticipated 
if competitors introduce new products and services embodying new technologies  or if new industry standards and practices emerge  our existing product and service offerings  technology and systems may become obsolete 
further  if we fail to adopt or develop new technologies or to adapt our products and services to emerging industry standards  we may lose current and future customers  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the financial services industry is changing rapidly and in order to remain competitive  we must continue to enhance and improve the functionality and features of our products  services and technologies 
these changes may be more difficult or expensive than we anticipate 
in addition  our networks  systems  computers and data could become vulnerable to attack  damage or unauthorized access as a result of rapid technological changes 
doral financial has been the subject of an investigation by the us attorney s office for the southern district of new york  which could require it to pay substantial fines or penalties 
on august   doral financial received a grand jury subpoena from the us attorney s office for the southern district of new york regarding the production of certain documents  including financial statements and corporate  auditing and accounting records prepared during the period relating to the restatement of doral financial s financial statements 
doral financial cannot predict when this investigation will be completed or what the results of this investigation will be 
the effects and results of this investigation could have a material adverse effect on doral financial s business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
adverse 
table of contents developments related to this investigation  including any expansion of its scope  could negatively impact doral financial and could divert efforts and attention of its management team from doral financial s ordinary business operations 
doral financial may be required to pay material fines  judgments or settlements or suffer other penalties  each of which could have a material adverse effect on its business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
this investigation could adversely affect doral financial s ability to obtain  and or increase the cost of obtaining  directors and officers liability insurance and or other types of insurance  which could have a material adverse effect on doral financial s businesses  results of operations and financial condition 
doral financial may be required to advance significant amounts to cover the reasonable legal and other expenses of its former officers and directors 
under doral financial s by laws  doral financial is obligated to pay in advance the reasonable expenses incurred by former officers and directors in defending civil or criminal actions or proceedings pending final disposition of such actions 
since  doral financial has been advancing funds on behalf of various former officers and directors in connection with the grand jury proceeding referred to above and ongoing investigations by the sec relating to the restatement of doral financial s financial statements 
on march   a former treasurer of doral financial was indicted for alleged criminal violations involving securities and wire fraud 
on april   the former treasurer of doral financial was convicted on three of the five counts of securities and wire fraud he was facing after a five week jury trial 
on august   the former treasurer of doral financial filed a complaint against doral financial in the supreme court of the state of new york 
the complaint alleges that doral financial breached a contract with the plaintiff and doral financial s by laws by failing to advance payment of certain legal fees and expenses that the former treasurer has incurred in connection with a criminal indictment filed against him in the us district court for the southern district of new york 
further  the complaint claims that doral financial fraudulently induced the plaintiff to enter into agreements concerning the settlement of a civil litigation arising from the restatement of doral financial s financial statements for fiscal years through the complaint seeks declaratory relief  damages  costs and expenses 
the former treasurer further moved for preliminary injunctive relief 
on december   the parties entered into a settlement agreement 
on december   the former treasurer s motion for a preliminary injunction was denied as moot  and all further proceedings were stayed  but the procedures for future disputes between the parties and outlined in the settlement agreement were not affected by the stay 
the amounts required to be advanced in an appeal of the criminal conviction could be substantial and could materially adversely affect doral financial s results of operations 
our businesses may be adversely affected by litigation or regulatory enforcement 
from time to time  our customers  or the government on their behalf  may make claims and take legal action relating to our performance of fiduciary or contractual responsibilities 
we may also face employment lawsuits or other legal claims 
in any such claims or actions  demands for substantial monetary damages may be asserted against us resulting in financial liability or an adverse effect on our reputation among investors or on customer demand for our products and services 
we may be unable to accurately estimate our exposure to litigation risk when we record balance sheet reserves for probable loss contingencies 
as a result  any reserves we establish to cover any settlements or judgments may not be sufficient to cover our actual financial exposure  which may have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
in the ordinary course of our business  we are also subject to various regulatory  governmental and law enforcement inquiries  investigations and subpoenas 
these may be directed generally to participants in the businesses in which we are involved or may be specifically directed at us 
in regulatory enforcement matters  claims for disgorgement  the imposition of penalties and the imposition of other remedial sanctions are possible 
the resolution of legal actions or regulatory matters  if unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations for the period in which such actions or matters are resolved or a reserve is established 

table of contents risks related to our common stock additional issuances of common stock or securities convertible into common stock may further dilute existing holders of our common stock 
we may determine that it is advisable  or we may encounter circumstances where we determine it is necessary  to issue additional shares of our common stock  securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of our common stock  or common equivalent securities to fund strategic initiatives or other business needs or to raise additional capital 
depending on our capital needs  we may make such a determination in the near future or in subsequent periods 
the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of any such future offering  as well as other sales of a large block of shares of our common stock or similar securities in the market thereafter  or the perception that such sales could occur 
in addition  such additional equity issuances would reduce any earnings available to the holders of our common stock and the return thereon unless our earnings increase correspondingly 
we cannot predict the timing or size of future equity issuances  if any  or the effect that they may have on the market price of our common stock 
the issuance of substantial amounts of equity  or the perception that such issuances may occur  could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
dividends on our common stock have been suspended  doral financial may not be able to pay dividends on its common stock in the future 
holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments 
on april   we announced that  as a prudent capital management decision designed to preserve and strengthen our capital  our board of directors had suspended the quarterly dividend on our common stock 
in addition  we will be unable to pay dividends on our common stock unless and until we resume payments of dividends on our preferred stock  which were suspended by the board of directors in march the company is subject to certain restrictions generally imposed on puerto rico corporations with respect to the declaration and payment of dividends ie  that dividends may be paid out only from the company s net assets in excess of capital or  in the absence of such excess  from the company s net earnings for such fiscal year and or the preceding fiscal year 
the federal reserve board has also issued a policy statement that  as a matter of prudent banking  a bank holding company should generally not maintain a given rate of cash dividends unless its net income available to common shareholders has been sufficient to fund fully the dividends and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent with the organization s capital needs  asset quality  and overall financial condition 
in february  the federal reserve published the supervisory letter  which  among other things  discusses the ability of bank holding companies to declare dividends and to redeem or repurchase equity securities 
the supervisory letter is generally consistent with prior federal reserve supervisory policies and guidance  although it places greater emphasis on discussions with the regulators prior to dividend declarations even when not explicitly required by the regulations 
the federal reserve provides that the principles discussed in the letter are applicable to all bank holding companies  but are especially relevant for bank holding companies that are experiencing financial difficulties 
the supervisory letter provides that a board of directors should eliminate  defer  or severely limit dividends if i the bank holding company s net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters  net of dividends paid during that period  is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends  ii the bank holding company s rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with capital needs and overall macroeconomic outlook  or iii the bank holding company will not meet  or is in danger of not meeting  its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios 
the supervisory letter further suggests that bank holding companies should inform the federal reserve in advance of paying a dividend that i exceeds the earnings for the quarter in which the dividend is being paid  or ii could result in a material adverse change to the organization s capital structure 
under an existing consent order with the federal reserve  we are restricted from paying dividends on our capital stock without the prior written approval of the federal reserve 
we are required to request permission for 
table of contents the payment of dividends on our common stock and preferred stock not less than days prior to a proposed dividend declaration date 
we may not receive approval for the payment of such dividends in the future or  even with such approval  our board of directors may not resume payment of dividends 
the price of our common stock may be subject to fluctuations and volatility 
the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations because of factors specifically related to our businesses and general market conditions 
factors that could cause such fluctuations  many of which could be beyond our control  include the following changes or perceived changes in the condition  operations  results or prospects of our businesses and market assessments of these changes or perceived changes  announcements of strategic developments  acquisitions and other material events by us or our competitors  changes in governmental regulations or proposals  or new government regulations or proposals  affecting us  including those relating to general market or economic conditions and those that may be specifically directed to us  the continued decline  failure to stabilize or lack of improvement in general market and economic conditions in our principal markets  the departure of key personnel  changes in the credit  mortgage and real estate markets  operating results that vary from expectations of management  securities analysts and investors  operating and stock price performance of companies that investors deem comparable to us  changes in financial reports by securities analysts  developments related to investigations  proceedings  or litigation that involves us  and the occurrence of major catastrophic events  including terrorist attacks 
all of our debt obligations and our preferred stock will have priority over our common stock with respect to payment in the event of a liquidation  dissolution or winding up 
in any liquidation  dissolution or winding up of doral financial  our common stock would rank below all debt claims against us and all of our outstanding shares of preferred stock 
as a result  holders of our common stock will not be entitled to receive any payment or other distribution of assets upon our liquidation or dissolution until after our obligations to our debt holders and holders of preferred stock have been satisfied 
our certificate of incorporation  our by laws and certain banking law provisions contain provisions that could discourage an acquisition or change of control of doral financial 
certain provisions under puerto rico and federal banking laws and regulations  together with certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by laws  may make it more difficult to effect a change in control of our company  to acquire us or to replace incumbent management 
these provisions could potentially deprive our stockholders of opportunities to sell shares of our common stock at above market prices 
our suspension of preferred stock dividends could result in the expansion of our board of directors 
on march   our board of directors announced that it had suspended the declaration and payment of all dividends on all outstanding series of our convertible preferred stock and our noncumulative preferred stock 
the suspension of dividends for our noncumulative preferred stock was effective and commenced with the dividends for the month of april the suspension of dividends for our convertible preferred stock was effective and commenced with the dividends for the quarter commencing in april 
table of contents since we have not paid dividends in full on our noncumulative preferred stock for at least eighteen consecutive monthly periods  or paid dividends in full on our convertible preferred stock for consecutive dividend periods containing in the aggregate a number of days equivalent to at least six fiscal quarters  the holders of our preferred stock  all acting together as a single class  have the right to elect two additional members to our board of directors 
we called a special meeting of our preferred stockholders to be held on august  to permit holders of our preferred stock to nominate and seek to have elected the two additional members to our board of directors 
due to the lack of a quorum  the special meeting was not able to be held 
the holders of of the total number of outstanding shares of our preferred stock  all acting together as a single class  are entitled to call a special meeting for the election of two additional members to our board of directors

the million decrease in non interest expense during compared to  was due largely to i a decrease of million in oreo expenses mainly due to the million provision recorded in the second quarter of when the company reduced the pricing of the properties to accelerate sales  ii a decrease of million in professional services driven by a decrease of million in defense litigation costs and a decrease of million in lower advisory services  iii lower fdic insurance expense of million related to a lower deposit base and a change in the method of computing the assessment  and iv a decrease of million in advertising expense as the company incurred higher expenses in due to the campaigns to gain market share in deposits and mortgage originations subsequent to the local market bank failures and asset acquisitions in april of income tax expense of million for the year ended december  compared to an income tax expense of million and an income tax benefit of million for the corresponding and periods 
the decrease in income tax expense of million is due mainly to the tax benefit recorded during  as well as funding doral money lending activities by us based funding sources and eliminating the withholding tax on debt payments from the us based lending operations to the puerto rico based funding operations 
the company reported other comprehensive loss of million for the year ended december   compared to other comprehensive income of million and million for the corresponding and periods 
the negative variance in other comprehensive income for the year ended december  compared to the period resulted principally from the sales of available for sale securities during that drove the realization of gains of million during doral financial s loan production for the year ended december  was billion  compared to billion and billion for the comparable and periods 
the production increase resulted mainly from the us loan originations production in commercial and industrial loans  which represented of the loan production 
total assets as of december  totalled billion compared to billion as of december  the decrease is mainly due to the sale of billion of mortgage backed securities in  which have been offset in part by net growth in loans and the purchases of billion in agency securities 
these sales were conducted pursuant to the company s deleveraging of the balance sheet and the substitution of lower yielding loans for higher yielding loans 
total deposits as of december  of billion decreased billion from deposits of billion as of december  the decrease is mainly due to the reduction of billion in brokered deposits as part of the company s strategy to reduce funding costs 
non performing loans  excluding fha va loans guaranteed by the us government as of december  were million  a decrease of million from december  the reduction in npls was a result of continued emphasis on collections and restructures to optimize performance of the loan portfolio during critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make a number of judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  income and expenses in doral financial s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
certain of these estimates are critical to the presentation of doral financial s financial condition since they are particularly sensitive to the company s judgment and are highly complex in nature 
doral financial believes that the judgments  estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements are appropriate given the factual circumstances as of december  however  given the sensitivity of doral financial s consolidated financial statements to these estimates  the use of other judgments  estimates and assumptions could result in material differences in doral financial s results of operations or financial condition 

table of contents various elements of doral financial s accounting policies  by their nature  are inherently subject to estimation techniques  valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments 
note to doral financial s consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the company s significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the accounting policies that have a significant impact on doral financial s consolidated financial statements and that require the most judgment are set forth below 
fair value measurements the company uses fair value measurements to state certain assets and liabilities at fair value and to support fair value disclosures 
securities held for trading  securities available for sale  derivatives and servicing assets are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis 
additionally  from time to time  the company may be required to record other financial assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis  such as loans held for sale  loans receivable and certain other assets 
these nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve application of lower of cost or market accounting or write downs of individual assets 
the company discloses for interim and annual reporting periods the fair value of all financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value  whether recognized or not in the statement of financial condition 
fair value hierarchy the company categorized its financial instruments based on the priority of inputs to the valuation technique into a three level hierarchy described below level valuation is based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets 
level valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active  and model based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market  or are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data  by correlation or by other means 
level valuation is generated from model based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market 
these unobservable assumptions reflect the company s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
valuation techniques include use of option pricing models  discounted cash flow models and similar techniques 
determination of fair value the company bases fair values on the price that would be received upon sale of an asset  or paid to transfer a liability  in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
it is doral financial s intent to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements  in accordance with the fair value hierarchy in the current accounting guidance 
fair value measurements for assets and liabilities where there is limited or no observable market data are based primarily upon the company s estimates  and are generally calculated based on current pricing policy  the economic and competitive environment  the characteristics of the asset or liability and other such factors 
therefore  the fair values represent management s estimates and may not be realized in an actual sale or immediate settlement of the asset or liability 
additionally  there may be inherent weaknesses in any calculation technique  and changes in the underlying assumptions used  including discount rates and estimates of future cash flows  could significantly affect the results of current or future values 
the company relies on appraisals for valuation of collateral dependent impaired loans and other real estate owned 
an appraisal of value is obtained at the time the loan is originated 
new estimates of collateral value are obtained when a loan that has been performing becomes delinquent and is determined to be collateral dependent  and at the time an asset is acquired through foreclosure 
updated reappraisals are requested at least every two years for collateral dependent loans and other real estate owned 

table of contents residential mortgage loans are considered collateral dependent when they are days past due collateral dependent residential loans are those past due loans whose borrower s financial condition has deteriorated to the point that doral considers only the collateral when determining its alll estimate 
an updated estimate of the property s value is obtained when the loan is days past due and a second assessment of value is obtained when the loan is days past due 
the company generally uses broker price opinions bpos as an assessment of value of collateral dependent residential mortgage loans 
as it takes a period of time for commercial loan appraisals to be completed once they are ordered  doral must at times estimate its allowance for loan and lease losses for an impaired loan using a dated  or stale  appraisal 
puerto rico has experienced some decrease in property values during its extended recession  therefore  the reported values of the stale appraisals must be adjusted to recognize the fade in market value 
in order to estimate the value of collateral with stale appraisals  doral has developed separate collateral price indices for small commercial loans and large commercial loans that are used to measure the market value fade in appraisals completed in one year to the current year 
the indices provide a measure of how much the property value has changed from the year in which the most recent appraisal was received to the current year 
in estimating its alll on collateral dependent loans using outdated appraisals  doral uses the original appraisal as adjusted for the estimated fade in property value less selling costs to estimate the current fair value of the collateral 
that current adjusted estimated fair value is then compared to the reported investment  and if the adjusted fair value is less than reported investment  that amount is included in the alll estimate 
residential development construction loans that are collateral dependent present unique challenges to the estimating the fair value of the underlying collateral 
residential development construction loans are partially completed with additional construction costs to be incurred  have units being sold and released from the construction loan  and may have additional land collateralizing the loan on which the developer hopes or expects to build additional units 
therefore  the value of the collateral is regularly changing and any appraisal has a limited useful life 
doral uses an internally developed estimate of value that considers doral s exit strategy of foreclosing and completing the construction started and selling the individual units constructed for residential buildings  and separately uses the most recent appraised value for any remnant land adjusted for the fade in value since the appraisal date as described above 
this internally developed estimate is prepared in conjunction with a third party servicer of the portfolio  who validates and determines the inputs used to arrive at the estimate of value eg units sold  expected sales  cost to complete  etc 
in the second quarter of  doral adopted the practice of charging off the portion deemed uncollectible of the difference between the loan balance before charge off and the estimated fair value of the property collateralizing the loan prior to receipt of a third party appraisal due to the long delays to receive such appraisals in doral s puerto rico market 
once third party appraisals are obtained  the previously estimated property values are updated with the actual values reflected in the appraisals and any additional loss incurred is recognized in the period when the appraisal is received 
the internally developed collateral price index is also updated and any changes resulting from the update in the index are also recognized in the period 
refer to note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion about the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities  the valuation methodologies used and its impact on earnings 
gain or loss on mortgage loan sales the company generally sells or securitizes a portion of the residential mortgage loans that it originates 
fha and va loans are generally securitized into gnma mortgage backed securities and held as trading securities 
after holding these securities for a period of time  usually less than one month  doral financial sells these securities for cash through broker dealers 
conforming conventional loans are generally sold directly to fnma  fhlmc or institutional investors or exchanged for fnma or fhlmc issued mortgage backed securities  which doral financial also sells for cash through broker dealers 

table of contents as part of its mortgage loan sale and securitization activities  doral financial generally retains the right to service the mortgage loans it sells 
doral financial determines the gain on sale of a mortgage backed security or loan pool by allocating the carrying value  also known as basis  of the underlying mortgage loans between the mortgage backed security or mortgage loan pool sold and its retained interests  based on their relative estimated fair values 
the gain on sale reported by doral financial is the difference between the proceeds received from the sale and the cost allocated to the loans sold 
the proceeds include cash and other assets received in the transaction primarily msrs less any liabilities incurred ie  representations and warranty provisions 
the amount of gain on sale is therefore influenced by the values of the msrs and retained interest recorded at the time of sale 
see retained interest valuation below for additional information 
if in a transfer of financial assets in exchange for cash or other consideration other than beneficial interests in transferred assets  doral financial has not surrendered control over the transferred assets  doral financial accounts for the transfer as a secured borrowing loan payable with a pledge of collateral 
retained interest valuation the company routinely originates  securitizes and sells mortgage loans into the secondary market 
the company generally retains the servicing rights and  in the past  also retained ios 
msrs represent the estimated present value of the normal servicing fees net of related servicing costs expected to be received on a loan being serviced over the expected term of the loan 
msrs entitle doral financial to a future stream of cash flows based on the outstanding principal balance of the loans serviced and the contractual servicing fee 
the annual servicing fees generally range between and basis points  less  in certain cases  any corresponding guarantee fee 
in addition  msrs may entitle doral financial  depending on the contract language  to ancillary income including late charges  float income  and prepayment penalties net of the appropriate expenses incurred for performing the servicing functions 
in certain instances  the company also services loans with no contractual servicing fee 
the servicing asset or liability associated with such loans is evaluated based on ancillary income  including float  late fees  prepayment penalties and costs 
the company s interests that continue to be held retained interest are subject to prepayment and interest rate risk 
msrs are classified as servicing assets in doral financial s consolidated statements of financial condition 
any servicing liability recognized is included as part of accrued expenses and other liabilities in doral financial s consolidated statements of financial condition 
the fair value of the company s msrs is determined based on a combination of market information servicing trades and broker valuations  benchmarking of servicing assets valuation surveys and cash flow modeling 
the valuation of the company s msrs incorporate two sets of assumptions i market derived assumptions for discount rates  servicing costs  escrow earnings rate  float earnings rate and cost of funds and ii market derived assumptions adjusted for the company s loan characteristics and portfolio behavior for escrow balances  delinquencies and foreclosures  late fees  prepayments and prepayment penalties 
for the year ended december   the fair value of the msrs totaled to million  which reflects a decline of million when compared to december  the decline in the msr is the result of the msr amortization of million offset by an increase in fair value of million 
ios represent the estimated present value of cash flows retained by the company that are generated by the underlying fixed rate mortgages as adjusted for prepayments after subtracting i the interest rate payable to the investor adjusted for any embedded cap  if applicable  and ii a contractual servicing fee 
as of december   the carrying value of the ios of million is related to million of outstanding principal balance of mortgage loans sold to investors 
ios are classified as securities held for trading in doral financial s consolidated statements of financial condition 
to determine the value of its portfolio of variable ios  doral financial uses an internal valuation model that forecasts expected cash flows using forward libor rates derived from the libor swap yield curve at the date of the valuation 
the characteristics of the variable ios result in an increase in cash flows when libor rates fall and a reduction in cash flows when libor rates rise 
this provides a mitigating effect on the impact of prepayment speeds on the cash flows  with prepayments expected to rise when long term interest rates fall reducing the amount of expected cash flows and the opposite when long term interest rise 
prepayment assumptions incorporated into the valuation model for variable and fixed ios are based on publicly available  
table of contents independently verifiable  prepayment assumptions for fnma mortgage pools and statistically derived prepayment adjusters based on observed relationships between the company s and fnma s us mainland mortgage pool prepayment experiences 
this methodology resulted in a cpr of for  for and for the company continues to benchmark its assumptions for setting its liquidity credit risk premium to a third party valuation provider 
this methodology resulted in a discount rate that was used for the years ended december   and  respectively 
for ios  doral financial recognizes as interest income through the life of the io the excess of all estimated cash flows attributable to these interests over their recorded balance using the effective yield method 
the company updates its estimates of expected cash flows periodically and recognizes changes in calculated effective yield on a prospective basis 
valuation of trading securities and derivatives doral financial s net gain loss on trading activities includes gains and losses  whether realized or unrealized  on securities accounted for as held for trading  including ios  as well as various other financial instruments  such as derivative contracts  that doral financial uses to manage its interest rate risk 
securities held for trading and derivatives are recorded at fair values with increases or decreases in such values reflected in current earnings 
the fair values of many of doral financial s trading securities other than ios are based on market prices obtained from market data sources 
for instruments not traded on a recognized market  doral financial generally determines fair value by reference to quoted market prices for similar instruments 
the fair values of derivative instruments are obtained using internal valuation models based on financial modeling tools and using market derived assumptions obtained from market data sources 
until the second quarter of  securities accounted as held for trading included us treasury security positions  taken as economic hedges against the valuation adjustment of the company s capitalized mortgage servicing rights msr 
subsequently  the us treasury positions were unwound and other derivative instruments were used as economic hedges on the msr 
generally  derivatives are financial instruments with little or no initial net investment in comparison to their notional amount and whose value is based on the value of an underlying asset  index  reference rate or other variable 
they may be standardized contracts executed through organized exchanges or privately negotiated contractual agreements that can be customized to meet specific needs  including certain commitments to purchase and sell mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities 
the fair value of derivatives is generally reported net by counterparty  provided that a legally enforceable master agreement exists 
derivatives in a net asset position are reported as part of securities held for trading  at fair value 
similarly  derivatives in a net liability position are reported as part of accrued expenses and other liabilities  at fair value 
for those derivatives not designated as an accounting hedge  fair value gains and losses are reported as part of net gain loss on trading activities in the consolidated statements of operations 
other than temporary impairment the company performs an assessment of other than temporary impairment whenever the fair value of an investment security is less that its amortized cost basis at the balance sheet dates 
amortized cost basis includes adjustments made to the cost of a security for accretion  amortization  collection of cash  previous otti recognized into earnings less any cumulative effect adjustments and fair value hedge accounting adjustments 
otti is considered to have occurred under the following circumstances i if the company intends to sell the investment security and its fair value is less than its amortized cost  ii if  based on available evidence  it is more likely than not that the company will decide or be required to sell the investment security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis  and iii if the company does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the investment security 
this occurs when the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis of the security 
in determining whether a credit loss exists  the company uses its best 
table of contents estimate of the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the investment security 
cash flows expected to be collected are estimated based on a careful assessment of all available information 
the amount of estimated credit loss is determined as the amount by which the amortized cost basis exceeds the present value of expected cash flows 
the company evaluates its individual available for sale investment securities for otti on at least a quarterly basis 
as part of this process  the company considers its intent to sell each investment security and whether it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery 
if either of these conditions is met  the company recognizes an otti charge to earnings equal to the entire difference between the security s amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date 
for securities that meet neither of these conditions  an analysis is performed to determine if any of these securities are at risk for otti 
to determine which securities are at risk for otti and should be quantitatively evaluated utilizing a detailed cash flow analysis  the company evaluates certain indicators which consider various characteristics of each security including  but not limited to  the following i the credit rating and related outlook or status of the securities  ii the creditworthiness of the issuers of the securities  iii the value and type of underlying collateral  iv the duration and level of the unrealized loss  v any credit enhancements  and vi other collateral related characteristics such as the ratio of credit enhancements to expected credit losses 
the relative importance of this information varies based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each security  as well as the economic environment at the time of assessment 
the amount of estimated credit loss is determined as the amount by which the amortized cost basis exceeds the present value of expected cash flows 
once a credit loss is recognized  the investment will be adjusted to a new amortized cost basis equal to the previous amortized cost basis less the amount recognized in earnings 
for the investment securities for which otti was recognized in earnings  the difference between the new amortized cost basis and the cash flows expected to be collected will be accreted as interest income 
interest income recognition on loans doral recognizes interest income on loans receivable on an accrual basis unless it is determined that collection of all contractual principal or interest is unlikely 
doral discontinues recognition of interest income when a loan receivable is days delinquent on principal or interest 
for mortgage loans doral discontinues recognition of interest income when the loan is four payments in arrears  except for mortgage loans insured by fha va that are placed in non accrual when the loans have ten payments in arrears 
loans determined to be well collateralized so that ultimate collection of principal and interest is not in question for example  when the outstanding loan and interest balance as a percentage of current collateral value is less than are not placed on non accrual status  and doral continues to recognize interest income 
when a loan is placed on non accrual  all accrued but unpaid interest is reversed against interest income in that period 
loans return to accrual status when principal and interest are current  or when the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection and collectability is no longer doubtful 
in the case of troubled debt restructuring agreements  the company continues to place the loans in non accrual status and reports the loans as non performing loans unless the company expects to collect all contractual principal and interest and the loans have proven repayment capacity for a sufficient amount of time 
previously reversed or not accrued interest will be credited to income in the period of recovery 
interest income is recognized when a payment is received on a non accrual loan if ultimate collection of principal is not in doubt 
accrued interest receivable on impaired loans is reversed when a loan is placed on non accrual status 
interest collections on non accruing loans  for which the ultimate collectability of principal is uncertain  are applied as principal reductions 
the judgment as to ultimate collectability is based upon collateral valuation  delinquency status  and management judgment of ultimate loan collectability  which may be based upon knowledge of specific borrower circumstances 
otherwise  such collections are credited to interest income when received 
these loans may be restored to accrual status when all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected  or when the loan otherwise becomes 
table of contents well secured and is in the process of collection 
the judgment as to returning a loan to accrual status considers recent collateral valuations  recent payment performance  borrowers other assets  and management s estimate as to future loan performance  which may be based upon knowledge of specific borrower circumstances 
loans whose contractual terms have been modified in a tdr and are performing at the time of restructuring remain on accrual status if there is demonstrated performance prior to the restructuring and payment in full under the restructured terms is expected 
otherwise  the loans are placed on non accrual status and reported as non performing until there is sustained repayment performance for a reasonable period 
for consumer loans primarily residential real estate  all of doral s loss mitigation tools require that the borrower demonstrate the intent and ability to pay all principal and interest on the loan 
doral must receive at least three consecutive monthly payments prior to qualifying the borrower for a loss mitigation product 
the company s loss mitigation specialists must be reasonably assured of the borrower s future repayment and performance from their review of the borrower s circumstances and  when all the conditions are met  the customer could be approved for a loss mitigation product 
following approval of the loss mitigation  doral must receive from the borrower three additional consecutive payments prior to returning the loan to accrual status 
consumer loans delinquent less than days that are eligible for loss mitigation products are subject to these requirements  except that the three consecutive payments prior to the restructure is waived 
allowance for loan and lease losses doral financial maintains an allowance for loan and lease losses to absorb probable credit related losses inherent on its loans receivable portfolio 
the allowance consists of specific and general components and is based on doral financial s assessment of default probabilities  internal risk ratings based on borrowers financial stability  external credit ratings  management strength  earnings and operating environment  probable loss and recovery rates  and the degree of risk inherent in the loans receivable portfolio 
the allowance is maintained at a level that doral financial considers appropriate to absorb probable losses 
credit losses are charged and recoveries are credited to the allowance  while increases to the allowance are charged to operations 
unanticipated increases in the allowance for loan and lease losses could adversely impact doral financial s net income in the future 
the company estimates and records its alll on a quarterly basis 
for all performing loans and non performing small balance homogeneous loans including residential mortgages  consumer  construction  commercial real estate and commercial under million  and performing construction  commercial real estate and commercial greater than million the alll is estimated based upon estimated probability of default and loss given default by shared product characteristics using the company s historical experience 
for larger construction  commercial real estate and commercial loans loan balance greater than million that are or more days past due or are  otherwise considered to be impaired  management estimates the related alll based upon an analysis of each individual loans characteristics 
the alll estimate methodologies are described in the following paragraphs 
residential mortgage the general allowance for residential mortgage loans is calculated based on the probability that loans within different delinquency buckets will default and  in the case of default  the extent of losses that the company expects to realize 
in determining the probabilities of default  the company considers the historical migration of loans to default status 
in determining the allowance for loan and lease losses for residential mortgage loans  for purposes of forecasting the future behavior of the portfolio  the company considers the migration analysis for periods beginning january  but more heavily weights the most recent experience 
consideration of both older and more recent experience ensures that the resulting reserve reflects the challenging economic conditions in puerto rico from through  the leveling of the economy in  and the effect of the company s increased collections efforts 
only using the older historical performance would yield lower probabilities of default that may not reflect recent macroeconomic trends and management changes 
severity of loss is calculated based on historical results from short sales and foreclosure sales 
historical results are adjusted for the company s expectation of housing prices 
severity assumptions for the residential portfolio range between and depending on the size of the loan and loan to value ratios  and up to for second mortgages 
for all loans whose terms have been modified and are considered troubled debt restructured 
table of contents loans  the loans are pooled and cash flows are forecasted including estimated future defaults  and the cash flows are discounted back to a present value using the average pool original yield 
construction  commercial real estate  commercial and industrial and land the alll for performing construction  commercial real estate  commercial and industrial and land loans is estimated considering either the probability of the loan defaulting in the next twelve months and the estimated loss incurred in the event of default or the loan quality assigned to each loan and the estimated expected loss associated with that loan grade 
the probability of a loan defaulting is based upon the company s experience in its current portfolio 
the loss incurred upon default is based upon the company s actual experience in resolving defaulted loans 
the company evaluates impaired loans and estimates the allowance based on current accounting guidance 
commercial and construction loans over million that are classified more than days past due  or when management is concerned about the collection of all contractual amounts due  are evaluated individually for impairment 
loans are considered impaired when  based on current information and events it is probable that the borrower will not be able to fulfill its obligation according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
during  as part of its continuous efforts to improve its alll estimates and to reflect the availability of new data and tools to analyze portfolio and borrower behavior  doral implemented several changes and enhancements to its alll estimation process 
most notably  doral i in the first quarter reviewed and expanded the appraisals received and included in the puerto rico cpi used to temporarily estimate real estate values of properties in the absence of a current updated estimate of value  ii received a significant number of new commercial real estate and construction loan appraisals during the third quarter  and iii changed the calculation to estimate the cash flows on residential mortgage loans that had been modified in a troubled debt restructuring 
these changes in estimate affected the provision for loan and lease losses by reducing the provision million for the cpi update and increasing the provision for loan and lease losses by million for receiving updated commercial real estate and construction loan appraisals in the third quarter  and increasing the provision million for revising the cash flow estimates based on new analysis of the residential mortgage loan portfolio 
during  management individually reviewed for impairment all commercial loans over  that were over days past due 
the impairment measurement of these smaller balance loans is now performed annually  with approximately one fourth of the population reviewed each quarter 
the impairment loss  if any  on each individual loan identified as impaired is generally measured based on the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
as a practical expedient  impairment may be measured based on the loan s observable market price  or the fair value of the collateral  if the loan is collateral dependent 
if foreclosure is probable  accounting guidance requires the measurement of impairment to be based on the fair value of the collateral 
if the loan is collateral dependent  regulatory guidance requires the impairment to be based upon the fair value 
when current appraisals are not available on properties subject to impairment measurement at quarter end  management determined its loss reserve estimates for these loans by estimating the fair value of the collateral 
in doing so  management considers a a number of factors including the price at which individual units could be sold in the current market  the period of time over which the units would be sold  the estimated cost to complete the units  the risks associated with completing and selling the units  the required rate of return on investment a potential acquirer may have and current market interest rates in the puerto rico market  or b uses an internal index of previously received appraisals from the same geography typically puerto rico covering the same time period since the stale appraisal was received to estimate the decline in value since the date of the most recent appraisal 
consumer the alll for consumer loans is estimated based upon the historical charge off rate using the company s historical experience 
the alll is supplemented by the company s policy to charge off all amounts in excess of the collateral value when the loan principal or interest is days or more days past due 
tdrs in accordance with accounting guidance  loans determined to be tdrs are impaired and for purposes of estimating the alll must be individually evaluated for impairment 
for residential mortgage loans determined to be tdrs  the company pools tdrs with similar characteristics and performs an impairment analysis of discounted cash flows 
if a pool yields a present value below the recorded investment in the pool of 
table of contents loans  the impairment is recognized by a charge to the provision for loan and lease losses and a credit to the allowance for loan and lease losses 
for loss mitigated loans without a concession in the interest rate  the company performs an impairment analysis of discounted cash flows giving consideration to the probability of default and loss given foreclosure on those estimated cash flows  and records the impairment by charging the provision for loan and lease losses with a corresponding credit to the alll 
generally  the percentage of the allowance for loan and lease losses to non performing loans will not remain constant due to the nature of the company s loan portfolios  which are primarily collateralized by real estate 
the collateral for each non performing mortgage loan is analyzed to determine potential loss exposure  and  in conjunction with other factors  this loss exposure contributes to the overall assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
on an ongoing basis  management monitors the loan portfolio and evaluates the adequacy of the alll 
in determining the adequacy of the alll  management considers such factors as default probabilities  internal risk ratings based on borrowers financial stability  external credit ratings  management strength  earnings and operating environment  probable loss and recovery rates  cash flow forecasts and the degree of risk inherent in the loan portfolios 
allocated general reserves are supplemented by a macroeconomic or emerging risk reserve 
this portion of the total allowance for loan and lease losses reflects management s evaluation of conditions that are not directly reflected in the loss factors used in the determination of the alll 
the conditions evaluated in connection with the macroeconomic and emerging risk allowance include national and local economic trends  industry conditions within the portfolios  recent loan portfolio performance  loan growth  changes in underwriting criteria and the regulatory and public policy environment 
loans  or portions of loans  estimated by management to be uncollectible are charged to the allowance for loan and lease losses 
recoveries on loans previously charged off are credited to the allowance 
provisions for loan and lease losses are charged to expenses and credited to the alll in amounts estimated by management based upon its evaluation of the known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
while management believes that the current alll is maintained at a level believed appropriate to provide for inherent probable losses in the loan portfolio  future additions to the allowance may be necessary 
if economic conditions or borrower behavior deviate substantially from the assumptions used by the company in determining the allowance for loan and lease losses further increases in the allowance may be required 
the company also engages in the restructuring and or modifications of the debt of borrowers  who are delinquent due to economic or legal reasons  if the company determines that it is in the best interest for both the company and the borrower to do so 
in some cases  due to the nature of the borrower s financial condition  the restructure or loan modification fits the definition of troubled debt restructuring tdr 
such restructures are identified as tdrs and accounted for as impaired loans 
estimated recourse obligation in the past  the company sold mortgage loans and mbs subject to recourse provisions 
pursuant to these recourse arrangements  the company agreed to retain or share the credit risk with the purchaser of such mortgage loans for a specified period or up to a certain percentage of the total amount in loans sold 
the company estimates the fair value of the retained recourse obligation or any liability incurred at the time of sale and includes such obligation with the net proceeds from the sale  resulting in a lower gain on sale recognition 
doral estimates the fair value of its recourse obligation based on historical losses from foreclosure and disposition of mortgage loans adjusted for expectations of changes in portfolio behaviour and market environment 
income taxes the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities based on current tax laws 
to the extent tax laws change  deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted  as necessary  in the period that the tax change is enacted 
the company recognizes income tax benefits when the realization of such benefits is probable 
a valuation allowance is recognized for any deferred tax asset which  based on management s evaluation  it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than that some portion or all of the deferred tax 
table of contents asset will not be realized 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and  in particular  any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
in assessing the realization of deferred tax assets  the company considers the expected reversal of its deferred tax assets and liabilities  projected future taxable income  cumulative losses in recent years and tax planning strategies 
the determination of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets requires judgment based on weight of all available evidence and considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence 
these estimates are projected through the life of the related deferred tax assets based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable and consistent with current operating results 
changes in future operating results not currently forecasted may have a significant impact on the realization of deferred tax assets 
the company classifies all interest and penalties related to tax uncertainties as income tax expense 
income tax benefit or expense includes i deferred tax expense or benefit  which represents the net change in the deferred tax assets or liability balance during the year plus any change in the valuation allowance  if any  and ii current tax expense 
results of operations for the years ended december   and net interest income net interest income is the excess of interest earned by doral financial on its interest earning assets over the interest incurred on its interest bearing liabilities 
doral financial s net interest income is subject to interest rate risk due to the repricing and maturity mismatch in the company s assets and liabilities 
generally  doral financial s residential mortgage assets have a longer maturity and a later repricing date than its liabilities  though its growing us based commercial loan portfolio is dominated by variable rate assets 
the net effect is doral will experience lower net interest income in periods of rising short term interest rates and higher net interest income in periods of declining short term interest rates

income taxes the puerto rico income tax law does not provide for the filing of a consolidated tax return  therefore  income tax expense on the company s consolidated statement of income is the aggregate income tax expense of doral s individual subsidiaries 
doral money  inc  a us corporation  and the us operations of doral bank  are subject to us income tax on its income derived from all sources 
substantially all other of the company s operations are conducted through subsidiaries in puerto rico 
income tax expense for the year was million compared to million in the year the decrease in income tax expense of million is due mainly to an million deferred tax benefit recorded during  is mostly related to a better utilization of the io deferred tax asset as there were more profits at some of the puerto rico entities  which allowed the release of a portion of the valuation allowance related to the io tax asset 
also  the income tax expense decreased as a result of funding of doral money lending activities with us based funding sources  therefore eliminating the withholding tax on debt payments from the us based lending operations to the puerto rico based funding operations 
income tax expense also includes branch level interest tax of million as a result of doral bank operating a us branch after the merger of doral bank fsb with doral bank 
however  this represents a tax savings when compared to the past withholding tax on the debt payments from doral money to doral bank 
doral bank may also be subject to branch profits tax in future tax years  but there was no branch profits tax in the current year as there was an increase in us net equity for the period 
as of december  and  the company had two puerto rico entities which were in a cumulative loss position 
for purposes of assessing the realization of the dtas  the cumulative taxable loss position for these two entities is considered significant negative evidence that has caused management to conclude that the company will not be able to fully realize the deferred tax assets related to these two entities in the future 
accordingly  as of december  and  the company determined that it was more likely than not that million and million  respectively  of its gross deferred tax asset would not be realized and therefore maintained a valuation allowance for those amounts 
for puerto rico taxable entities with positive core earnings  a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets was not recorded in and since they are expected to continue to be profitable 
at december  and  the net deferred tax asset associated with these two companies was million and million  respectively 
in addition  as of december  and  approximately and million  
table of contents respectively  of the io tax asset would be realized through these entities 
in management s opinion  for these companies  the positive evidence of profitable core earnings outweighs any negative evidence 
management did not establish in a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets generated on the unrealized losses of its securities available for sale because the company does not intend to sell the securities before recovery of value  and based on available evidence it is not more likely than not that the company will decide or be required to sell the securities before the recovery of its amortized cost basis 
management has therefore determined that a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets generated on the unrealized losses of its securities available for sale is not necessary at this time 
as of december   the valuation allowance also includes million related to deferred taxes on unrealized losses on cash flow hedges 
there is no valuation allowance related to the cash flow hedges as of december  on january   the governor signed into law the internal revenue code of code making the pr code ineffective  for the most part  for years commenced after december  under the provisions of the code  the maximum statutory corporate income tax rate is for years commenced after december  and ending before january   if the government meets its income generation and expense control goals  for years commenced after december   the maximum corporate tax rate will be 
the code  however  eliminated the special surtax on corporations for tax year in general  the code maintains the increase in carry forward periods for net operating losses from to years as provided for in act  maintains the concept of the alternative minimum tax although it changed the way it is computed  and specifies what types of auditors report will be acceptable when audited financial statements are required to be filed with the income tax return 
notwithstanding  a corporation may be subject to the provisions of the pr code if it so elects it by the time it files its income tax return for the first year commenced after december  and ending before january  once the election is made  it will be effective for such year and the next succeeding years 
management assesses the realization of its deferred tax assets at each reporting period 
to the extent that earnings improve and the deferred tax assets become realizable  the company may be able to reduce the valuation allowance through earnings

operating segments doral financial determined its reportable segments based upon the company s organizational structure and the information provided to the chief operating decision maker  to the senior management team and  to a lesser extent  the board of directors 
management also considered the internal reporting used to evaluate performance and to assess where to allocate resources 
other factors such as the company s organizational chart  nature of the products  distribution channels and the economic characteristics of the products were also considered in the determination of the reportable segments 
during  the company reorganized its reportable segments consistent with its return to profitability plan 
the strategic plan has the objectives of establishing a focused approach for a turnaround and returning to profitability  and of managing its liquidating portfolios 
the company now operates in the following four reportable segments puerto rico this segment is the company s principal market and includes all mortgage and retail banking activities in puerto rico including loans  deposits and insurance activities 
this segment operates a branch network in puerto rico of branches offering a variety of consumer loan products as well as deposit products and other retail banking services 
this segment s primary lending activities have traditionally focused on the origination of residential mortgage loans in puerto rico 
united states this segment is the company s principal source of growth in the current economic environment

table of contents with branches in new york and florida 
this segment also includes the company s middle market syndicated lending unit that is engaged in purchasing assigned interests in senior credit facilities in the us syndicated leverage loan market and is the primary source of growth in the company s loan portfolio 
liquidating operations this segment manages the company s liquidating portfolios comprised primarily of construction and land portfolios loans and repossessed assets with the purpose of maximizing the company s returns on these assets 
there is no expected growth in the portfolios within this segment except as part of a workout function 
treasury the company s treasury function handles its investment portfolio  interest rate risk management and liquidity position

the accounting policies followed by the segments are generally the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in the annual report on form k  except for intersegment transactions 
intersegment transactions are made to account for loans in which segments with excess liquidity lend cash to segments with a shortage of liquidity 
the extent of the intersegment loans is calculated based on the net assets less allocated equity of each segment 
intersegment interest income and expense is calculated based on portfolio specifics and market terms 
income tax expense has not been deducted in the determination of segment profits 
prior to  doral financial managed its business in three operating segments mortgage banking activities  banking including thrift operations  and insurance agency activities 
the company s segment reporting was organized by legal entity and aggregated by line of business 
legal entities that do not meet the threshold for separate disclosure are aggregated with other legal entities with similar lines of business 
management had previously made this determination based on operating decisions particular to each business line and because each one targets different customers and required different strategies 
in the past  the company managed a fourth operating segment  institutional securities operations  however  effective on december   doral securities was merged with and into its holding company  doral financial

commercial and consumer lines of credit are included in the loan production according to the credit limit approved 
loan production increased million  or  in the year ended december  when compared to the corresponding period 
for the year ended december   the higher volume was mainly driven by an increase of approximately million in commercial real estate loans and an increase of million in commercial and industrial loans principally originated by the company s us lending unit  which is engaged in purchasing assignment interests in senior credit facilities in the syndicated loan market 
these increases were partially offset by a decline of million in construction development loans and declines of million and million in the origination of conventional non conforming and fha va loans  respectively  by the company s puerto rico lending unit 
doral s loan production for the year ended december  includes million of assigned interests in loans acquired from the lead financial institutions through syndication

for the years ended december    and  refinancing transactions represented approximately  and  respectively  of the total dollar volume of internally originated mortgage loans 
doral financial s future results could be adversely affected by a significant increase in mortgage interest rates that may continue to reduce the refinancing activity 
however  the company believes 
table of contents that refinancing activity in puerto rico is less sensitive to interest rate changes than in the mainland united states because a significant number of refinance loans in the puerto rico mortgage market are made for debt consolidation purposes rather than interest savings due to lower rates 
loan origination channels in puerto rico  doral financial relies primarily on doral bank s extensive branch network to originate loans 
it supplements these originations with wholesale purchases from other financial institutions 
purchases generally consist of conventional mortgage loans 
doral financial also originates consumer  commercial  construction and land loans primarily through its banking subsidiary

the main component of doral financial s servicing income is loan servicing fees  which depend on the type of mortgage loan being serviced

the company does not expect significant losses related to these delinquencies since it has established a reserve for loans under recourse agreements and for other non recourse loans has not experienced significant losses in the past 

table of contents as part of its servicing responsibilities  in some servicing agreements  doral financial is required to advance the scheduled payments of principal or interest whether or not collected from the underlying borrower 
while doral financial generally recovers funds advanced pursuant to these arrangements within days  it must absorb the cost of funding the advances during the time the advance is outstanding 
in the past  doral financial sold pools of delinquent fha and va and conventional mortgage loans 
under these arrangements  doral financial is required to advance the scheduled payments whether or not collected from the underlying borrower 
while doral financial expects to recover a significant portion of the amounts advanced through foreclosure or  in the case of fha and va loans  under the applicable fha and va insurance and guarantee programs  the amounts advanced tend to be greater than normal arrangements because of the large number of delinquent loans 
loans held for sale loans held for sale are carried at the lower of net cost or market value on an aggregate portfolio basis 
the amount  by which cost exceeds market value  if any  is accounted for as a loss through a valuation allowance 
changes in the valuation allowance are included in the determination of income in the period in which those changes occur and are reported under net gain on mortgage loan sales and fees in the consolidated statements of operations 
given traditional consumer preferences in puerto rico  substantially all of doral financial s residential loans held for sale are fixed rate loans 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements accompanying this annual report on form k for additional information regarding doral financial s portfolio of loans held for sale 
as of december   loans held for sale totaled million  of which approximately million consisted of residential mortgage loans 
gnma programs allow financial institutions to buy back individual delinquent mortgage loans that meet certain criteria from the securitized loan pool for which the company provides servicing 
at the company s option and without gnma prior authorization  doral financial may repurchase such delinquent loans for an amount equal to of the loan s remaining principal balance 
this buy back option is considered a conditional option until the delinquency criteria are met  at which time the option becomes unconditional but not an obligation 
when the loans backing a gnma security are initially securitized  the company treats the transaction as a sale for accounting purposes and the loans are removed from the balance sheet because the conditional nature of the buy back option means that the company does not maintain effective control over the loans 
when individual loans later meet gnma s specified delinquency criteria and are eligible for repurchase  doral financial is deemed to have regained effective control over these loans 
in such case  for financial reporting purposes  the delinquent gnma loans are brought back into the company s portfolio of loans held for sale  regardless of whether the company intends to exercise the buy back option 
an offsetting liability is also recorded 
as of december   the portfolio of loans held for sale includes million related to gnma defaulted loans  compared to million and million as of december  and  respectively

table m recorded investment in loans receivable by contractual maturities as of december  year or less to years over years total in thousands consumer residential mortgage fha va guaranteed residential mortgage consumer other total consumer lease financing receivables commercial real estate commercial and industrial construction and land loans receivable  gross scheduled contractual amortization of loans receivable does not reflect the expected life of doral financial s loans receivable portfolio 
the average life of these loans is substantially less than their contractual terms because of prepayments and  with respect to conventional mortgage loans  due on sale clauses  which give 
table of contents doral financial the right to declare a conventional mortgage loan immediately due and payable in the event  among other things  that the borrower sells the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid 
the average life of mortgage loans tends to increase when current mortgage loan rates are higher than rates on existing mortgage loans and  conversely  decrease when current mortgage loan rates are lower than rates on existing mortgage loans 
under the latter circumstance  the weighted average yield on loans decreases as higher yielding loans are repaid or refinanced at lower rates 
the following table sets forth the dollar amount of total loans receivable at december   as shown in the preceding table  which have fixed interest rates or which have floating or adjustable interest rates that have a contractual maturity of more than one year

unlike its portfolio of residential mortgage loans  which is comprised almost entirely of fixed rate mortgage loans  a significant portion of doral financial s construction and land  and other commercial loans classified as loans receivable carry adjustable rates 
at december   and  approximately  and  respectively  of doral financial s gross loans receivable were adjustable rate loans 
the increase in the percentage of adjustable rate loans from to was due to the growth in the syndicated loan portfolio 
the adjustable rate construction and land and commercial loans have interest rate adjustment limitations and are generally tied to the prime rate  and often provide for a maximum and minimum rate beyond which the applicable interest rate will not fluctuate 
future market factors may affect the correlation of the interest rate adjustment with the rate doral financial pays on the different funding sources used to finance these loans 
please refer to note of the consolidated financial statements accompanying this annual report on form k for additional information regarding doral financial s portfolio of loans receivable 
investment and trading activities as part of its mortgage securitization activities  doral financial is involved in the purchase  securitization and sale of mortgage backed securities

at december   doral financial had unrealized losses in aoci of approximately  compared to unrealized gains of million at december   related to its available for sale portfolio 
investment securities currently held by the company are principally mbs or securities backed by a us government sponsored entity on which principal and interest are considered recoverable  agency securities  and non agency cmos 
during  the company sold approximately billion of investment securities  and also purchased million of securities 
these actions are part of the execution of the company strategy to de lever and reposition the balance sheet 
for the year ended december   the company recognized gains on sale of investment securities available for sale of million as a result of the sale of agency securities and doral s strategic balance sheet restructuring efforts 
as a result of its review of the portfolio as of december   the company performed a detailed cash flow analysis of certain securities in unrealized loss positions to assess whether they were otti 
the company uses a third party provider to generate cash flow forecasts of each security reviewed based on a combination of management and market driven assumptions and securitization terms  including remaining payment terms of the security  prepayment speeds  the estimated amount of loans to become seriously delinquent over the life of the security  the estimated life time severity rate  estimated losses over the life of the security  loan characteristics  the level of subordination within the security structure  expected housing price changes and interest rate assumptions 
during  management determined that three investment securities were otti and recorded as credit loss of million 
these three securities had an amortized cost of million as of december  that includes otti of million see explanation below for otti recorded on these securities during 
during  management determined that eight investment securities reflected otti 
the characteristics of these securities that led to the otti conclusion included i the cumulative level and estimated future delinquency levels  ii the effect of severely delinquent loans on forecasted defaults  iii the cumulative severity and expected severity in resolving the defaulted loans  and iv the current subordination of the securities that resulted in the present value of the forecast cash flows being less than the cost basis of the security 
management estimated that a credit loss of million was incurred on these securities for the year december  five of the eight otti securities determined to be otti in  were subordinated interests in a securitization structure collateralized by option adjustable rate mortgage arm loans and resulted in the recognition of an otti loss of million during subsequently during  the company sold these five securities among others and recognized a loss of million  of which million had previously been reflected in other comprehensive income loss 
the three remaining securities with otti at december  were puerto rico non agency cmos that include subordinated tranches of securitizations of doral originated mortgage loans primarily composed of and vintages 
doral purchased these cmos at a discounted price of of par value  anticipating a partial loss of principal and interest value 
these original three securities had an amortized cost of million as of december  including an otti loss of million due to credit 
higher default and loss assumptions driven by higher delinquencies in puerto rico  primarily due to the impact of inflationary pressures on the consumer  the high rate of unemployment and general recessionary condition on the island  has resulted in 
table of contents higher default and loss estimates on the pr non agency cmos 
the higher default and loss estimates have resulted in lower bond prices and higher levels of unrealized losses on the bonds 
it is possible that future loss assumptions could change and cause future otti charges in these securities 
as of december  and  the company did not intend to sell the remaining securities which were evaluated for otti and concluded it was not more likely than not that it would be required to sell these securities before the anticipated recovery of each security s remaining amortized cost basis 
therefore  the difference between the amortized cost basis and the market value of the securities is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
for the remainder of the company s securities portfolio that have experienced decreases in the fair value  the decline is considered to be temporary as the company expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis on the securities and neither intends to sell these securities nor is it more likely than not that it will be required to sell these securities 
once an otti credit loss is recognized  the investment is adjusted to a new amortized cost basis equal to the previous amortized cost basis less the amount recognized in earnings 
for the investment securities for which otti was recognized in earnings  the difference between the new amortized cost basis and the cash flows expected to be collected will be accreted as interest income

liquidity of the banking subsidiary doral financial s liquidity and capital position at the holding company differ from the liquidity and capital position of the company s banking subsidiary 
doral financial s banking subsidiary relies primarily on deposits  including brokered deposits  borrowings under advances from fhlb and repurchase agreements secured by pledges of its mortgage loans  mortgage backed securities and other borrowings 
in periods previous to december   the banking subsidiary has used as its primary sources of liquidity term deposits  notes backed by fhlb letters of credit and auction term funds to depository institutions granted by the federal reserve under term auction facility taf 
the banking subsidiary has significant investments in loans and investment securities  which together with the owned mortgage servicing rights  serve as a source of cash from interest and principal received from loan customers 
to date  these sources of liquidity for doral financial s banking subsidiary have not been materially adversely impacted by the current challenging liquidity conditions in puerto rico and the us mortgage and credit markets 
cash sources and uses doral financial s sources of cash as of december  include retail and commercial deposits  brokered deposits  borrowings under advances from fhlb  borrowings from the federal reserve  repurchase financing agreements  principal repayments and sales of loans and investment securities 
management does not contemplate material uncertainties in the rolling over of deposits  both retail and wholesale  and is not engaged in capital expenditures that would materially affect the capital and liquidity positions 
in addition  the company s banking subsidiary maintains borrowing facilities with the fhlb and at the discount window of the federal reserve  and has additional collateral that can be used to raise funds under these facilities 
doral financial s uses of cash as of december   include origination and purchase of loans  purchase of investment securities  repayment of obligations as they become due  dividend payments related to the preferred stock which were suspended by the company s board of directors on march effective during the second quarter of  and other operational needs 
the company is also required to deposit cash or qualifying securities to meet margin requirements 
to the extent that the value of securities previously pledged as collateral declines because of changes in interest rates  a market liquidity crisis or any other factors  the company will be required to deposit additional cash or securities to meet its margin requirements  thereby adversely affecting its liquidity

this transaction resulted in a million fee paid to the fhlb  which is deferred and amortized over the term of the borrowings 
during the second quarter of  the company increased its advances from fhlb using the proceeds to repay securities sold under agreements to repurchase from the fhlb  reducing contractual interest rates from to  and the average effective interest rate from to  an extending the average maturity from months to months 
the transaction resulted in a million fee which is capitalized and amortized as a yield adjustment 
the proceeds from the sale were used to repay other repurchase agreements  fund new loans  or were retained as cash

table of contents include certificate of deposits and money market deposits 
brokered deposits are used by the company s banking subsidiary as a source of long term funds  and doral financial s banking subsidiary has traditionally been able to replace maturing brokered deposits 
brokered deposits  however  are generally considered by some a less stable source of funding than deposits obtained through retail bank branches 
brokered deposit investors are generally more sensitive to interest rates and sometimes move funds from one depository institution to another based on minor differences in rates offered on deposits 
the company s banking subsidiary  as a member of the fhlb  has access to collateralized borrowings from the fhlb up to a maximum of of total assets 
in addition  the fhlb makes available additional borrowing capacity in the form of repurchase agreements on qualifying high grade securities 
advances and reimbursement obligations with respect to letters of credit must be secured by qualifying assets with a market value of of the advances or reimbursement obligations 
as of december   doral financial s banking subsidiary had billion in outstanding advances from fhlb at a weighted average interest rate cost of 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements accompanying this annual report on form k for additional information regarding such advances 
doral financial also derives liquidity from the sale of mortgage loans in the secondary mortgage markets 
the us including puerto rico secondary mortgage market is the most liquid in the world in large part because of the sale or guarantee programs maintained by fha  va  hud  fnma and fhlmc 
to the extent these programs are curtailed or the standard for insuring or selling loans under such programs is materially increased  or  for any reason  doral financial were to fail to qualify for such programs  doral financial s ability to sell mortgage loans and consequently its liquidity would be materially adversely affected 
other uses of cash servicing agreements relating to the mbs programs of fnma  fhlmc and gnma  and to mortgage loans sold to certain other investors  require the company to advance funds to make scheduled payments of principal  interest  taxes and insurance  if such payments have not been received from the borrowers 
while the company generally recovers funds advanced pursuant to these arrangements within days  it must absorb the cost of funding the advances during the time the advance is outstanding 
for the year ended december   the monthly average amount of funds advanced by the company under such servicing agreements was approximately million  compared to million for the corresponding period of to the extent the mortgage loans underlying the company s servicing portfolio experience increased delinquencies  the company would be required to dedicate additional cash resources to comply with its obligation to advance funds as well as incur additional administrative costs related to increases in collection efforts 
in the past  the company sold pools of delinquent fha and va and conventional mortgage loans 
under these arrangements  the company is required to advance the scheduled payments whether or not collected from the underlying borrower 
while the company expects to recover the amounts advanced through foreclosure or  in the case of fha va loans  under the applicable fha and va insurance and guarantee programs  the amounts advanced tend to be greater than normal arrangements because of the delinquent status of the loans 
as of december  and  the outstanding principal balance of such delinquent loans was million and million  respectively  and the aggregate monthly amount of funds advanced by the company was million and million  respectively 
when the company sells mortgage loans to third parties which serve as a source of cash it also generally makes customary representations and warranties regarding the characteristics of the loans sold 
to the extent the loans do not meet specified characteristics investors are generally entitled to cause the company to repurchase such loans 
in addition to its servicing and warranty obligations  in the past the company s loan sale activities have included the sale of non conforming mortgage loans subject to recourse arrangements that generally require the company to repurchase or substitute the loans if the loans are days or more past due or otherwise in default up to a specified amount or limited to a period of time after the sale 
to the extent the delinquency ratios of the loans sold subject to recourse are greater than anticipated and the company is required to repurchase more loans than anticipated  the company s liquidity requirements would increase 
refer to off balance sheet activities below for additional information on these arrangements 

table of contents in the past  doral financial sold or securitized mortgage loans with fnma on a partial or full recourse basis 
the company s contractual agreements with fnma authorize fnma to require doral financial to post collateral in the form of cash or marketable securities to secure such recourse obligation to the extent the company does not maintain an investment grade rating 
as of december   the company s maximum recourse exposure with fnma amounted to million and required the posting of a minimum of million in collateral to secure recourse obligations 
while considered unlikely by the company  fnma has the contractual right to request collateral for the full amount of the company s recourse obligations 
any such request by fnma would have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity and business 
refer to note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements and off balance sheet activities below for additional information on these arrangements 
under the company s repurchase lines of credit and derivative contracts  doral financial is required to deposit cash or qualifying securities to meet margin requirements 
to the extent that the value of securities previously pledged as collateral declines because of changes in interest rates or other market conditions  the company will be required to deposit additional cash or securities to meet its margin requirements  thereby adversely affecting its liquidity 
assets and liabilities doral s assets totaled billion at december   compared to billion at december  total assets as of december   decreased million when compared to december  this decrease was largely due to a net reduction of billion in securities available for sale  partially offset by an increase of million in loans net of allowance for loan and lease losses 
the decrease in securities is due mostly to the several sales of mortgage backed securities during the year as part of the company s strategy to reduce securities and increase loan exposure

doral financial s asset liability management committee has been created under the authority of the board of directors to manage the company s interest rate  market value of equity and liquidity risk 
the alco is primarily responsible for ensuring that doral financial operates within the company s established asset liability management policy guidelines and procedures 
the alco reports directly to the risk policy committee of the board of directors 
the alco is responsible for developing the company s asset liability management and liquidity strategy  establishing and monitoring of interest rate  pricing and liquidity risk limits to ensure compliance with the company s policies  overseeing product pricing and volume objectives for banking and treasury activities  and overseeing the maintenance of management information systems that supply relevant information for the alco to fulfill its responsibilities as it relates to asset liability management 
risk identification measurement and control doral financial manages interest rate exposure related to its assets and liabilities on a consolidated basis 
changes in interest rates can affect the volume of doral financial s mortgage loan originations  the net interest income earned on doral financial s portfolio of loans and securities  the amount of gain on the sale of loans and the value of doral financial s servicing assets  loans  investment securities and other retained interests 

table of contents as part of its interest rate risk management practices  doral financial has implemented measures to identify the interest rate risk associated with the company s assets  liabilities and off balance sheet activities 
the company has also developed policies and procedures to control and manage these risks and continues to improve its interest rate risk management practices 
the company currently manages its interest rate risk by principally focusing on the following metrics i net interest income sensitivity  ii market value of equity sensitivity  iii effective duration of equity  and iv maturity repricing gaps 
doral financial s asset liability management policies provide a limit structure based on these four metrics 
a single limit is defined for effective duration of equity 
net interest income sensitivity limits are set for instantaneous parallel rate shifts 
specific parallel rate shifts defined for net interest income and market value equity limits are bps  bps  bps  bps  bps  and bps 
net interest income sensitivity limits are established for different time horizons 
additional limits are defined for maturity repricing mismatches  however management continues to emphasize risk management and controls based on net interest income and market value of equity sensitivity as these measures incorporate the effect of existing asset liability mismatches 
the explanations below provide a brief description of the metrics used by the company and the methodologies assumptions employed in the estimation of these metrics net interest income sensitivity 
refers to the relationship between market interest rates and net interest income due to the maturity mismatches and repricing characteristics of doral financial s interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and off balance sheet positions 
to measure net interest income exposure to changes in market interest rates  the company uses earnings simulation techniques 
these simulation techniques allow for the forecasting of net interest income and expense under various rate scenarios for the measurement of interest rate risk exposures of doral financial 
primary scenarios include instantaneous parallel and non parallel rate shocks 
net interest income sensitivity is measured for time horizons ranging from twelve to sixty months and as such  serves as a measure of short to medium term earnings risk 
the basic underlying assumptions used in net interest income simulations are i the company maintains a static balance sheet  ii full reinvestment of funds in similar product instruments with similar maturity and repricing characteristics  iii spread assumed constant  iv prepayment rates on mortgages and mortgage related securities are modeled using multi factor prepayment model  v non maturity deposit decay and price elasticity assumptions are incorporated  and vi evaluation of embedded options is also taken into consideration 
to complement and broaden the analysis of earnings at risk the company also performs earning simulations for longer time horizons 
market value of equity sensitivity 
used to capture and measure the risks associated with longer term maturity and re pricing mismatches 
doral financial uses value simulation techniques for all financial components of the consolidated statement of financial condition 
valuation techniques include static cash flows analyses  stochastic models to qualify value of embedded options and prepayment modeling 
to complement and broaden the risk analysis  the company uses duration and convexity analysis to measure the sensitivity of the market value of equity to changes in interest rates 
duration measures the linear change in market value of equity caused by changes in interest rates  while  convexity measures the asymmetric changes in market value of equity caused by changes in interest rates due to the presence of options 
the analysis of duration and convexity combined provide a better understanding of the sensitivity of the market value of equity to changes in interest rates 
effective duration of equity 
the effective duration of equity is a broad measure of the impact of interest rate changes on doral financial s economic capital 
the measure summarizes the net sensitivity of assets and liabilities  adjusted for off balance sheet positions 
interest rate risk management strategy doral financial s current interest rate management strategy is implemented by the alco and is focused on reducing the volatility of the company s earnings and to protect the market value of equity 
while the current strategy will also use a combination of derivatives and balance sheet management  more emphasis is placed on balance sheet management 

table of contents net interest income risk 
in order to protect net interest income against interest rate risk  the alco employs a number of tactics which are evaluated and adjusted in relation to prevailing market conditions 
internal balance sheet management practices are designed to reduce the re pricing gaps of the company s assets and liabilities 
however  the company will use derivatives  mainly interest rate swaps and interest rate caps  as part of its interest rate risk management activities 
interest rate swaps represent a mutual agreement to exchange interest rate payments  one party pays fixed rate and the other pays a floating rate 
for net interest income protection  doral financial typically enters into a fixed rate payer float receiver swaps to eliminate the variability of cash flows associated with the floating rate debt obligations 
market value of equity 
due to the composition of doral financial s assets and liabilities  the company has earnings exposure to rising interest rates 
the company measures the market value of all rate sensitive assets  liabilities and off balance sheet positions  and the difference between assets and liabilities  adjusted by off balance sheet positions  is termed market value of equity 
the company measures how the market value of equity fluctuates with different rate scenarios to measure risk exposure of economic capital or market value of equity 
management uses duration matching strategies to manage the fluctuations of market value of equity within the long term targets established by the board of directors of the company 
duration risk 
duration is a measure of the impact in magnitude and direction of changes on interest rates in the economic value of financial instruments 
in order to bring duration measures within the policy thresholds established by the company  management may use a combination of internal liability management techniques and derivative instruments 
derivatives such as interest rate swaps  treasury futures  eurodollar futures and forward contracts may be entered into as part of the company s risk management 
convexity risk 
convexity is a measure of how much duration changes as interest rates change 
for doral financial  convexity risk primarily results from mortgage prepayment risk 
as part of managing convexity risk management may use a combination of internal balance sheet management instruments or derivatives  such as swaptions  caps  floors  put or call options on interest rate indexes or related fixed income underlying securities ie eurodollar  treasury notes 
hedging related to mortgage banking activities 
as part of doral financial s risk management of mortgage banking activities  such as secondary market and servicing assets  the company enters into forward agreements to buy or sell mbs to protect the company against changes in interest rates that may impact the economic value of servicing assets or the pricing of marketable loan production 
hedging the various sources of interest rate risks related to mortgage banking activities is a complex process that requires sophisticated modeling  continuous monitoring and active management 
while doral financial balances and manages the various aspects relating to mortgage activities  there are potential risks to earnings associated to them 
some of these potential risks are the valuation of msrs are recorded in earnings immediately within the accounting period in which the changes in value occur  whereas the impact of changes in interest rates are reflected in originations with a time lag and effects on servicing fee income occurs over time 
thus  even when mortgage activities could be protected from adverse changes in interest rates over a period of time on a cumulative basis they may display large variations in income from period to period 
the degree to which the natural hedge associated to mortgage banking ie originating and servicing offsets changes in servicing asset valuations may be imperfect  as it may vary over time 
origination volumes  the valuation of servicing assets  economic hedging activities and other related costs are impacted by multiple factors  which include  changes in the mix of new business  changes in the term structure of interest rates  changes in mortgage spreads mortgage basis to other rate benchmarks  and rate volatility  among others 
interrelation of all these factors is hard to predict and  as such  the ability to perfectly hedge their effects is limited 

table of contents doral financial s risk profile doral financial s goal is to manage market and interest rate risk within targeted levels established and periodically reviewed by the board of directors of the company 
interest rate sensitivity represents the relationship between market interet rates and the net interest income due to existing maturity and repricing imbalances between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
interest rate sensitivity is also defined as the relationship between market interest rates and the economic value of equity referred to market value of equity or mve 
the interest risk profile of the company is measured in the context of net interest income  market value of equity  maturity repricing gaps and effective duration of equity 
the risk profile of the company is managed by use of natural offsets generated by the different components of the balance sheet as a result of the normal course of business operations and through active hedging activities by means of both on balance sheet and off balance sheet transactions ie derivative instruments to achieve targeted risk levels 
the company s interest rate risk exposure may be asymmetric due to the presence of embedded options in products and transactions which allow clients and counterparties to modify the maturity of loans  securities  deposits and or borrowings 
examples of embedded options include the ability of a mortgagee to prepay his her mortgage or a counterparty exercising its puttable option on a structured funding transaction 
assets and liabilities with embedded options are evaluated taking into consideration the presence of options to estimate their economic price elasticity and also the effect of options in assessing maturity repricing characteristics of the company s balance sheet 
the embedded optionality is primarily managed by purchasing or selling options or by other active risk management strategies involving the use of derivatives  including the forward sale of mbs 
the company measures interest rate risk and has specific targets for various market rate scenarios 
general assumptions for the measurement of interest income sensitivity are i rate shifts are parallel and instantaneous throughout all benchmark yield curves and rate indexes  ii behavioral assumptions are driven by simulated market rates under each scenario ie prepayments  repricing of certain liabilities  iii static balance sheet assumed with cash flows reinvested at forecasted market rates ie forward curve  static spreads in similar instruments 
for net interest income the company monitors exposures and has established limits for time horizons ranging from one up to three years  although for risk management purposes earning exposures are forecasted for longer time horizons 
the tables below present the risk profile of doral financial taking into account the derivatives set forth below under basis point parallel and instantaneous increases or dercreases of interest rates  as of december  and table v risk profile as of december  market value of equity risk net interest income risk bps bps as of december  market value of equity risk net interest income risk bps bps based on month forward change in net interest income 
the net interest income nii sensitivity measure to a one hundred basis point parallel and instantaneous rate increase  based on a month horizon  changed from to when comparing december  to the effect is driven mostly due to sale of investment securities and the growth of variable rate commercial loans 

table of contents as of december  the market value of equity mve showed lower sensitivity to rising interest rates when compared to december  mve sensitivity to an increase of one hundred basis points in market rates changed from to 
the sale of investment securities  lengthening of maturities in borrowings  restructure of advances from the fhlb and reduction in mismatches from lending activities  have all contributed to reducing mve exposure 
the following table shows the company s investment portfolio sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
the table below assumes parallel and instantaneous increases and decreases of interest rates as of december  and as of december  change in fair value of available for sale securities change in interest rates basis points in thousands base derivatives 
as described above  doral financial uses derivatives to manage its exposure to interest rate risk caused by changes in interest rates 
derivatives are generally either privately negotiated over the counter otc contracts or standard contracts transacted through regulated exchanges 
otc contracts generally consist of swaps  caps and collars  forwards and options 
exchange traded derivatives include futures and options 
the company is subject to various interest rate cap agreements to manage its interest rate exposure 
interest rate cap agreements generally involve purchase of out of the money caps to protect the company from larger rate moves and to provide the company with positive convexity 
non performance by the counterparty exposes doral financial to interest rate risk

interest rate swap agreements generally involve the exchange of fixed and floating rate interest payment obligations without the exchange of the underlying principal 
the company principally uses interest rate swaps to convert floating rate liabilities to fixed rate by entering into pay fixed receive floating interest rate swaps 
non performance by the counterparty exposes doral financial to interest rate risk 

table of contents the following table summarizes the company s interest rate swaps outstanding at december  table y interest rate swaps notional amount maturity date pay fixed rate receive floating rate fair value dollars in thousands cash flow hedge  october  month libor plus  november  month libor plus freestanding derivatives 
doral financial uses derivatives to manage its market risk and generally accounts for such instruments on a mark to market basis with gains or losses charged to current operations as part of net gain loss on trading activities as they occur 
contracts with positive fair values are recorded as assets and contracts with negative fair values as liabilities  after the application of netting arrangements 
fair values of derivatives such as interest rate futures contracts or options are determined by reference to market prices 
fair values for derivatives purchased in the otc market are determined by valuation models and validated with prices provided by external sources 
the notional amounts of freestanding derivatives totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively 
notional amounts indicate the volume of derivative activity  but do not represent doral financial s exposure to market or credit risk 
derivatives hedge accounting 
doral financial seeks to designate derivatives under hedge accounting guidelines when it can clearly identify an asset or liability that can be hedged pursuant to the strict hedge accounting guidelines 
the notional amount of swaps treated under hedge accounting totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
the company typically uses interest rate swaps to convert floating rate advances from fhlb to fixed rate by entering into pay fixed receive floating swaps 
in these cases  the company matches all of the terms in the advance from fhlb to the floating leg of the interest rate swap 
since both transactions are symmetrically opposite the effectiveness of the hedging relationship is high 
the following table summarizes the total derivative positions at december  and and their respective designations

the market risk of derivatives arises principally from the potential for changes in the value of derivative contracts based on changes in interest rates 
the credit risk of otc derivatives arises from the potential of counterparties to default on their contractual obligations 
to manage this credit risk  doral financial deals with counterparties of good credit standing  enters into master netting agreements whenever possible and monitors the market on pledged collateral to minimize credit exposure 
master netting agreements incorporate rights of set off that provide for the net settlement of contracts with the same counterparty in the event of default 
as a result of the ratings downgrades affecting doral financial  counterparties to derivative contracts used for interest rate risk management purposes could increase the applicable margin requirements under such contracts  or could require the company to terminate such agreements

table of contents credit risk doral financial is subject to credit risk  particularly with respect to its investment securities and loans receivable 
for a discussion of credit risk on investment securities refer to note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
loans receivable are loans that doral financial holds for investment and  therefore  the company is at risk for the term of the loans 
because many of doral financial s loans collateralized by real estate  are made to borrowers located in puerto rico and secured by properties located in puerto rico  the company is subject to credit risk tied to adverse economic  political or business developments and natural hazards  such as hurricanes  that may affect puerto rico 
the puerto rico economy has been in a recession since this has affected borrowers disposable incomes and their ability to make payments when due  causing an increase in delinquency and foreclosure rates 
while the rate of economic contraction has slowed down substantially  the company believes that these conditions will continue to affect its credit quality 
in addition  there is evidence that property values have declined from their peak 
this has reduced borrowers capacity to refinance and increased the company s exposure to loss upon default 
this decline in prices and increases in expected defaults are incorporated into the loss rates used for calculating the company s allowance for loan and lease losses 
in september  the governor of pr signed into law act no 
of which established various housing tax and other incentives to stimulate the sale of new and existing housing units 
the tax and other incentives  which include incentives or reductions relating to capital gains taxes  property taxes and property recording fees and stamps  will be in effect until december  and are expected to continue to have a favorable impact in the current economic environment and new home absorption in puerto rico 
with respect to mortgage loans originated for sale as part of its mortgage banking business  doral financial is generally at risk for any mortgage loan default from the time it originates the mortgage loan until the time it sells the loan or securitizes it into a mbs 
with respect to fha loans  doral financial is insured as to principal by the fha against foreclosure loss 
va loans are guaranteed within a range of to of the principal amount of the loan subject to a maximum  ranging from  to  in addition to the mortgage collateral 
prior to  the company sold loans on a recourse basis as part of the ordinary course of business 
as part of such transactions  the company committed to make payments to investors to remedy loan defaults or to repurchase defaulted loans 
refer to off balance sheet activities above for additional information regarding recourse obligations 
in mid  the company discontinued the practice of selling mortgage loans with recourse  except for recourse related to early payment defaults 
doral financial s residential mortgage loan portfolio does not include a significant amount of adjustable interest rate  negative amortization  or other exotic credit features that are common in other parts of the united states 
however  as part of its loss mitigation programs  the company has granted certain concessions to borrowers in financial difficulties that have proven payment capacity  which may include interest only periods or temporary interest rate reductions 
interest rate reductions below contractual rate are typically limited to twelve months  and interest only periods are generally limited to twenty four months 
the payments for these loans will reset at the former payment amount unless the loan is restructured again or the restructured terms are extended 
substantially all residential mortgage loans are conventional and year amortizing fixed rate loans at origination 
there has been significantly less fade in residential real estate values in homes under  in puerto rico  the price point for the preponderance of doral s residential mortgage loan portfolio 
the residential mortgage portfolio includes loans that  at some point were repurchased pursuant to recourse obligations and  as a result  have a higher credit risk 
repurchases of delinquent loans from recourse obligations for the year ended december  totaled to million 
the company recorded a provision for recourse of million  which is included within the foreclosure and other credit related expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
when repurchased from recourse obligations  loans are recorded at their market value  which considers the credit quality 
loans collateralized by land in puerto rico totaled to million as of december  of the puerto rico land loans  million are reported as impaired  net of prior charge offs of million 
doral also has reserves of million as of year end allocated to the impaired loans 
doral s charge offs and reserves 
table of contents are based upon internal estimates of net realizable value in a market with few land transactions on which to base the estimates 
doral is in the process of obtaining updated property valuations on all the impaired loans 
if the new appraisal estimated land value change significantly from doral s estimates  the company may be required to record material future loan loss provisions and charge offs 
historically  doral financial provided land acquisition  development  and construction financing to developers of residential housing projects 
construction loans extended to developers are typically adjustable rate loans  indexed to the prime interest rate with terms ranging generally from to months 
doral financial principally targeted developers of residential construction for single family primary home occupancy 
as a result of the negative outlook for the puerto rico economy and its adverse effect on the construction industry  during  the company ceased financing new housing projects in puerto rico 
the recorded balance for the puerto rico residential housing construction sector has decreased from million as of december   to million as of december   mainly due to foreclosure  charge offs and repayment 
management expects that the construction and land loan portfolio will continue to decrease in future periods 
the company continues to grow its us loans portfolio  primarily dominated by commercial loans 
during  gross loan receivable of the us operations increased million when compared to  this increase was mainly related to syndicated loans 
refer to the loans section for more information 
the performance of such loans is subject to the continued strength of the new york city and united states economies 
for the year ended december   the commercial real estate portfolio experienced an increase in late stage delinquency mainly attributed to adverse performance of the small commercial portfolio related to the continued recessionary conditions in puerto rico 
management continues to take certain actions to mitigate the risk in the portfolio  including leveraging the collections and loss mitigation resources from the residential mortgage area to the small commercial area as well as expanding advisory services of third party service providers for the large commercial area in order to work out delinquent loans and prevent performing loans from becoming delinquent 
loan modifications and troubled debt restructurings with puerto rico unemployment at approximately for  many borrowers have temporarily lost their means to pay their loan contractual principal and interest obligations 
as a result of the economic hardships  a number of borrowers have defaulted on their debt obligations  including residential mortgage loans 
the lower level of income and economic activity has also led to fewer new construction residential home sales  increased commercial real estate vacancy  and lower business revenues  which has led to increased defaults on commercial  commercial real estate  construction and land loans 
doral s management has concluded that it is in the company s best interest  and in the best interest of the puerto rican economy and citizenry  if certain defaulted loans are restructured in a manner that keeps borrowers in their homes  or businesses operating  rather than foreclosing on the loan collateral if it is concluded that the borrower s payment difficulties are temporary and doral will in time collect the loan principal and agreed upon interest 
doral has created a number of loan modification programs to help borrowers stay in their homes and operate their businesses which also optimizes borrower performance and returns to doral 
in these cases  the restructure or loan modification fits the definition of troubled debt restructuring as defined by current accounting guidance 
the programs are designed to provide temporary relief and  if necessary  longer term financial relief to the consumer loan customer 
doral s consumer loan loss mitigation program including consumer loan products and residential mortgage loans  grants a concession for economic or legal reasons related to the borrowers financial difficulties that doral would not otherwise consider 
doral s loss mitigation programs can provide for one or a combination of the following movement of unpaid principal and interest to the end of the loan  extension of the loan term for up to ten years  deferral of principal payments for a period of time  and reduction of interest rates either permanently feature discontinued in or for a period of up to two years 
no programs adopted by doral provide for the forgiveness of contractually due principal or interest 
deferred principal and uncollected interest are added to the end of the loan term at the time of the restructuring and uncollected interest is not recognized as income until collected when the loan is paid off 
it is doral s intention to make these programs available only to those borrowers who have defaulted  or are likely to default permanently  on their loan and would lose their homes in foreclosure action absent a lender concession 
however  doral will move 
table of contents borrowers and properties to foreclosure if the company is not reasonably assured that the borrower will be able to repay all contractual principal or interest

concessions made for commercial loans could include reductions in interest rates  extensions of maturity  waiving of borrower covenants  or other contract changes that would be considered a concession 
doral mitigates loan defaults for its commercial loan portfolios loans through its loan workout function 
the function s objective is to minimize losses upon default of larger credit relationships 
the group uses relationship officers  collection specialists  attorneys and third party service providers to supplement its internal resources 
in the case of construction and development loans for residential projects  the workout function monitors project specifics  such as project management and marketing 
residential  other consumer or commercial loan modifications can result in returning a loan to accrual status when certain criteria are met 
loan modifications also increase doral s interest income by returning a non performing loan to performing status and cash flows from the payments by the borrower 
residential mortgage loans consist of million  or of tdr loans as of december  of the residential mortgage loan tdrs  million  or  were restructured at effective rates at least equal to the market interest rate at modification and may  upon reset of the interest rate at the conclusion of the reduced rate period and sustained repayment at the higher interest rate  be removed from reporting as a tdr 
as of december   million of residential mortgage tdrs have an effective rate equal or higher than the market interest rate and of those loans were performing 

table of contents amounts that could become eligible for exclusion from reporting as tdr residential mortgage loans  for the years and are as follows amount during first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter during it is expected that not all loans that are structurally eligible to be excluded from tdr reporting will meet the performance criteria for exclusion  and that new loans will be restructured and meet the requirements to be reported as a tdr  so the total tdr balance is not expected to decline by the amount shown in the table above 
doral s residential mortgage loan modifications programs have provided for significant one year decreases in interest rates to provide time for customers to restore their ability to service ongoing financial obligations 
at the time the rates reset  there is a risk that the borrower will not be able to make the higher payments payment shock 
during the percent of loans percentage based on the number of loans that have reached the period at which the interest rates have reset to the higher rates  are current defined as less than two payments delinquent and having made at least one payment of the higher interest rate was of all loans reaching their reset date 
this percentage may change in future periods  increasing or decreasing  depending upon general economic conditions and individual financial circumstances of doral s borrowers and collection efforts  however it provides an early indicator of management s expectations of borrower performance 
many of those borrowers not able to meet the original modification payments at reset will be further counseled  the loan s rate adjusted and other terms changed in a second loan modification to a payment the borrower can afford for a sustained period of time 
to the extent the borrower does not qualify for a second modification  or cannot service the debt as modified  doral will initiate foreclosure proceeding or other resolution strategy 
a significant portion of doral s restructured residential mortgage loans were current or paid off as of december   as illustrated by the table of restructured loans that are non performing at december  by year of restructure table ee tdr residential mortgage loans by restructure vintage year restructured upb at time of restructure remaining upb of restructured loans days and over delinquent at december  percentage of restructured upb days and over loans are included in period of most recent restructure  if subject to more than one restructure

for residential mortgage loans doral discontinues recognition of interest income when the loan is four payments in arrears  except for mortgage loans 
table of contents insured by fha va that are placed in non accrual when the loans have ten payments in arrears 
loans determined to be well collateralized so that ultimate collection of principal and interest is not in question for example  when the outstanding loan and interest balance as a percentage of current collateral value is less than are not placed on non accrual  and doral continues to recognize interest income 
when a loan is placed on non accrual  all accrued but unpaid interest is reversed against interest income in that period 
loans return to accrual status when principal and interest are current  or when the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection and collectability is no longer doubtful 
the company also places in non accrual status all construction loans for residential properties classified as substandard whose sole source of payment is interest reserves funded by doral financial 
in the case of troubled debt restructuring agreements  the company continues to report the loans in non accrual status unless the company expects to collect all contractual principal and interest and the loans have proven repayment capacity for a sufficient amount of time 
previously reversed or not accrued interest will be credited to income in the period of collection 
interest income is recognized when a payment is received on a non accrual loan if ultimate collection of principal is not in doubt 
for the year ended december   doral financial would have recognized million  compared to million and million for the corresponding and periods  in additional interest income had all delinquent loans been accounted for on an accrual basis 
this amount includes interest reversal on loans placed on non accrual status during the period 
for consumer loans primarily residential real estate  all of doral s loss mitigation tools require that the borrower demonstrate the intent and ability to pay principal and interest on the loan prior to moving back the loan to accrual status 
doral must receive at least three consecutive monthly payments prior to qualifying the borrower for a loss mitigation product 
doral s loan underwriters must be reasonably assured of the borrower s future repayment and performance from their review of the borrower s circumstances  and when all the conditions are met  the customer is approved for a loss mitigation product and placed on a probation period for three months  if a payment is missed during the probationary period  the loan reverts to its original terms  and collections foreclosure procedures begin from the point at which they stood prior to the restructure 
the loan is reported as a tdr at the time the parties agree to modify the loan 
consumer loans not delinquent days or four payments for residential mortgage that are eligible for loss mitigation products are subject to the same requirements as the delinquent consumer loans except the receipt of the three months of payment in advance of the restructures is waived 
for commercial loan loss mitigation which includes commercial real estate  commercial and industrial  construction and land loans  the loans are underwritten by the collections or commercial function  depending on the loss mitigation alternative  the intent and ability of the borrower to service the debt under the revised terms scrutinized  and if approved for the tdr  the borrower is placed on a six month probationary period during which the loan is reported as a tdr and the customer is required to make six consecutive payments or equivalent in a lump sum before the loan is returned to accrual status 
upon receiving the six consecutive payments or the equivalent amount  the commercial loan is returned to accrual status 
if the loan was in accrual status at the time of the tdr  the loan is kept in accrual status if the ultimate collection of principal and interest is not in question  and placed in a probationary period 
if a payment is missed during the probationary period  the loan reverts to its original terms and collections foreclosure procedures begin from the point at which they stood prior to the restructure

this decrease was partially offset by an increase in the allowance of loan and lease losses of million on the commercial and industrial portfolio resulting from the increase on non performing loans due to economic distress in puerto rico 
the provision for loan and lease losses for the year ended december  decreased by million to million compared to million the same period in this decrease is related to a reduction of million in the commercial real estate  million in non fha va residential mortgage  million in the construction and land portfolio  million in the other consumer portfolio  and million on the commercial and industrial portfolio 
the decrease on the provision for loan and lease losses is primarily due to the decrease in the rate of credit quality deterioration in the loan portfolio as the improving gross domestic product trend was reflected in borrower performance 
in addition  there were several specific loans  or transactions  that resulted in significant provisions in for which there was no comparable change in specifically  in  a large commercial real estate loan on an operating hotel in puerto rico was classified as non performing and resulted in a provision of approximately million 
in addition  in  a portfolio of loans was transferred to a third party at a price that resulted in additional provisions of approximately million 
the provision for loan and lease losses for the year ended december   reflected an increase of million compared to the corresponding period  primarily in non fha va residential mortgage  commercial real estate and construction and land portfolios 
the provision for loan and lease losses for the residential mortgage portfolio increased by million  or  for the year ended december   when compared to the corresponding period 
this increase was driven by i an increase of million due to tdrs individually evaluated for impairment  ii an increase of million related to the impact of net charge offs on the allowance  iii million due to transfers of foreclosed loans to oreo  and this was partially offset by million due to delinquency improvement 
the provision for loan and lease losses for the commercial real estate portfolio increased by million for the year ended december   when compared to the corresponding period due to i a million provision related to a reduction in the threshold for individually evaluating impaired loans from million to

the provision for loan and lease losses on the construction and land loan portfolio increased million during primarily due to the sale of a construction portfolio to a third party during the third quarter of that resulted in additional provisions of million  this offset by the release of million in reserve as one project loan was worked out 
in general  the increase in the provision for loan and lease losses during was largely driven by the impact of loss mitigation efforts including the sale of a portion of the construction loan portfolio  delinquencies trends  properties in foreclosure  decreases in real estate values  an increase in severities in the determination of the provision due to strategic decision to accelerate oreo dispositions and the continued deterioration in the puerto rico economy 
the allowance for loan and lease losses for the year ended december   was reduced by net charge offs of million  which included million related to the sale of certain construction loans  million related to a classified participation interest  million related to partial charge offs on residential mortgage loans during the period  million related to other consumer loans as those rolled to the delinquency bucket  as well as charge offs of previously reserved balances as a confirmed loss determinations are reached 
net charge offs on residential mortgage loans increased due to the implementation in of the company s real estate valuation policy under which the company obtains assessments of collateral value for residential mortgage loans over days past due and any outstanding balance in excess of the value of the property less cost to sell is classified as loss and written down by charging the allowance for loan and lease losses

after consideration of partial charge offs  credit related discounts and deferred fees  net  the adjusted total coverage ratio as a percentage of loans increased basis points to in december  from in december  the increase on the coverage ratio considering partial charge offs  credit related discounts and deferred fees as a percentage of loans was affected by the increase in partial charge offs  and an increase on the loan portfolio  and the decrease in the allowance of loan and lease losses 
the increase in partial charge offs was related to the non fha va residential mortgage million  commercial real estate million and construction and land million 
the increase on the loan portfolio was driven by the us operations  which due to the performance of that portfolio  does not require significant reserves 
the decrease in the alll is due to charge offs recorded previously and stabilizing credit quality deterioration in puerto rico 
the coverage ratio considering partial charge offs  credit related discounts and deferred fees as a percentage of non performing loans decreased basis points to from as of december  and  respectively 
the decrease of basis points as a percentage of non performing loans is the net effect of an increase in non fha va residential mortgage non performing loans and an increase in partial charge offs  net of a decrease in non performing commercial real estate and construction and land loans 
doral discontinued new construction lending in puerto rico in  new commercial real estate and commercial and industrial lending in puerto rico in  and significantly tightened its residential underwriting standards in doral s seasoned vintages  where problems have been identified and addressed in previous periods  require smaller additional provisions at this time

the construction and land loan portfolio decreased million  and non performing construction and land loans decreased million during the year ended december   largely due to charge offs of million and foreclosures 
these decreases have a direct impact on the reduction of the alll assigned to this portfolio and the unadjusted coverage ratio decline 
the construction and land loans portfolio decreased million for the year ended december  mainly due to charge offs of million 
for the year ended december   construction and land npls decreased million as a result of the sale of construction loan portfolio that included approximately million non performing loans as of december  
table of contents there were also certain restructures and a reduction in non performing us construction loans of million as one large loan was worked out  that significantly affects the coverage ratio

historically  doral reduced the reported balance of collateral dependent commercial  construction and land loans a loan is collateral dependent when the loan collateral is considered the likely source of repayment of a delinquent loan by a charge to the alll upon receipt of a current market appraisal value 
as a result of significant delays in receiving new market value appraisals on puerto rico property  doral has developed a methodology to estimate market values for all commercial real estate  construction and land properties  based upon the changes in market values in new appraisals received 
based on this new practice  during the year ended december   the company recorded charge offs amounting to million due to the difference between the loan balance before the charge offs and the estimated fair value of the property collateralizing the loan 
counterparty risk the company has exposure to many different counterparties  and it routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry  including brokers and dealers  commercial banks  and other institutional clients 
loans  derivatives  investments  repurchase agreements  other borrowings  and receivables  among others  expose the company to counterparty risk 
many of these transactions expose the company to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client 
in addition  the company s credit risk may be impacted when the collateral held by it cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to the company 
there can be no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations 
the company has procedures in place to mitigate the impact of default among its counterparties 
the company requests collateral for most credit exposures with other financial institutions and monitors these on a regular basis 
nevertheless  market volatility could impact the valuation of collateral held by the company and result in losses 
operational risk operational risk includes the potential for financial losses resulting from failed or inadequate controls 
operational risk is inherent in every aspect of business operations  and can result from a range of factors including human judgment  process or system failures  business interruptions  or attacks  damage or unauthorized access to our networks  systems  computers and data

general business and economic conditions  puerto rico economy and fiscal condition the company s business and financial results are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in puerto rico and the united states 
significant business and economic conditions include short term and long term interest rates  inflation and the strength or weakness of the puerto rico and united states economies and housing markets 
if any of these conditions deteriorate  the company s business and financial results could be adversely affected 
for example  business and economic conditions that negatively impact household income could decrease the demand for residential mortgage loans and increase the number of customers who become delinquent or default on their loans  or  a dramatically rising interest rate environment could decrease the demand for loans and negatively affect the value of the company s investments and loans 
inflation also generally results in increases in general and administrative expenses 
interest rates normally increase during periods of high inflation and decrease during periods of low inflation 
refer to risk management above for a discussion of the effects of changes of interest rates on the company s operations 
given that almost all of our business is in puerto rico and the united states and given the degree of interrelation between puerto rico s economy and that of the united states  we are particularly exposed to downturns in the united states economy 
dramatic declines in the united states housing market over the past few years  with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures  unemployment and underemployment  have negatively impacted the performance of mortgage loans and resulted in significant write downs of asset values by financial institutions 
the united states and other countries recently faced a severe economic crisis  including a major recession 
these adverse economic conditions have negatively affected  and are likely to continue to negatively affect for some time  the company s assets  including its loans and securities portfolios  capital levels  results of operations and financial condition 
in response to the economic crisis  the united states and other governments established a variety of programs and policies designed to mitigate the effects of the crisis 
these programs and policies appear to have stabilized the severe financial crisis that occurred in the second half of  but the extent to which these programs and policies will assist in a continued economic recovery or may lead to adverse consequences  whether anticipated or unanticipated  is still unclear 

table of contents in addition  economic uncertainty that may result from the recent downgrading of united states long term debt  from fiscal imbalances in federal  state and local municipal finances combined with the political difficulties in resolving these imbalances  and from debt and other economic problems of several european countries  may directly or indirectly adversely impact economic conditions faced by the company and its customers 
any increase in the severity or duration of adverse economic conditions  including a double dip recession in the united states  would adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company s business activities and credit exposure are concentrated in puerto rico 
consequently  its financial condition and results of operations are highly dependent on economic conditions in puerto rico 
puerto rico s economy is currently in a recession that began in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year that ended june  a fiscal year in which puerto rico s gross national product grew by only 
puerto rico s real gross national product decreased by   and  respectively  for fiscal years   and according to the puerto rico planning board s latest projections made in march  puerto rico s real gross national product was projected to have contracted by during fiscal year puerto rico s real gross national product for fiscal year  however  is projected to grow by 
according to data published by the puerto rico department of labor  the number of persons employed in puerto rico during fiscal year averaged  a decrease of compared to the previous fiscal year  and the unemployment rate averaged 
during the first four months of fiscal year  total employment averaged  a decline of with respect to the same period of the prior fiscal year  and the unemployment rate averaged 
since  the government of puerto rico has experienced a structural imbalance between recurring government revenues and total expenditures 
the structural imbalance was exacerbated during fiscal years and  with recurring government expenditures significantly exceeding recurring government revenues 
prior to fiscal year  the puerto rico government bridged the deficit resulting from the structural imbalance through the use of non recurring measures  such as borrowing from the government development bank for puerto rico or in the bond market  postponing the payment of various government expenses  such as payments to suppliers and utilities providers  and other one time measures such as the use of derivatives and borrowings collateralized with government assets such as real estate and uncollected general fund revenues 
since march  the government has taken multiple steps to address and resolve the structural imbalance 
for fiscal year  the deficit was approximately billion  consisting of the difference between revenues and expenses for such fiscal year 
for fiscal year  the deficit was approximately billion excluding certain debt service that was refinanced and the deficit for fiscal year was approximately billion excluding certain debt service that was refinanced 
the deficit for fiscal year has been estimated at million 
measures that the government of puerto rico has implemented have included reducing expenses  including public sector employment through layoffs of employees 
since the government of puerto rico is the largest source of employment in puerto rico  these measures have had the effect of increasing unemployment and could have the effect of intensifying the current recessionary cycle 
the current state of the puerto rico economy and continued uncertainty in the public and private sectors has had an adverse effect on the credit quality of our loan portfolios and reduced the level of our originations in puerto rico 
the continuation of the economic slowdown would cause those adverse effects to continue  as delinquency rates may continue to increase in the short term  until sustainable growth of the puerto rico economy resumes 
also  potential reduction in consumer spending as a result of continued recessionary conditions may also impact growth in our other interest and non interest revenue sources 
future growth of the puerto rico economy will depend on several factors including the condition of the united states economy  the relative stability of the price of oil imports  the exchange value of the united states dollar  the level of interest rates  the effectiveness of the recently approved changes to local tax incentive legislation  and the continuing economic uncertainty generated by the puerto rico government s fiscal condition

table of contents unfunded pension benefit obligations and funding shortfalls of the retirement system  under business the commonwealth in item of this annual report on form k for the year ended december  the company cannot predict at this time the impact that the current fiscal situation of the commonwealth of puerto rico and the various legislative and other measures adopted by the puerto rico government in response to such fiscal situation will have on the puerto rico economy and on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company operates in a highly competitive industry that could become even more competitive as a result of economic  legislative  regulatory and technological changes 
the company faces competition in such areas as mortgage and banking product offerings  rates and fees  and customer service 
in addition  technological advances and increased e commerce activities have  generally  increased accessibility to products and services for customers which has intensified competition among banking and non banking companies in the offering of financial products and services  with or without the need for a physical presence
