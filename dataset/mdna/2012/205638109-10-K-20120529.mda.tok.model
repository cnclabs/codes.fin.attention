excluding the impact from foreign currency fluctuations and divested product revenue  maintenance fees declined million for fiscal as compared to fiscal and declined million for fiscal as compared to fiscal the decreases were due to a decline in maintenance fees associated with our mainframe product lines 
although we continue to experience a high maintenance renewal rate with our current mainframe customers  the decline in mainframe license deals during prior years is impacting mainframe maintenance revenue as new or growth customers are not entirely replacing the maintenance revenue loss from the non renewed or reduced capacity mainframe maintenance arrangements 
the decline was partially offset by an increase in apm maintenance fees primarily due to sales growth in our apm product line during fiscal and fiscal including additional maintenance related to the dynatrace acquisition 
subscription fees increased million during fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily as a result of new saas solution sales exceeding customer cancellations

the increase in subscription fees for fiscal is primarily the result of new saas solution sales exceeding customer cancellations

apm segment revenue increased million during fiscal as compared to fiscal due primarily to a million increase in subscription fees and an million increase in software license fees 
the increase in subscription fees can be attributed to a full year of revenue from subscription services offerings in fiscal as opposed to only five months during fiscal  as we acquired gomez in november see note of the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information

significant license transactions during fiscal resulted in the recognition of approximately million in license fees 
we do not anticipate comparable revenues from significant license transactions in the coming years and therefore  expect mainframe revenue to decline going forward

these actions  which focused on exiting low margin engagements  caused the reduction in revenue from fiscal to fiscal operating expenses increased million for fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to increased staffing levels and increases in subcontractor costs to manage the growth of the business 
the decrease in contribution margin for fiscal as compared to fiscal was caused by the revenue reserve discussed above  partially offset by increases in average billing rates 
the decline in operating expenses and the increase in contribution margin for fiscal as compared to fiscal were primarily attributable to lower compensation  employee benefit and travel costs due to reductions in employee headcount and the exit of low margin engagements resulting from our restructuring programs 
through these initiatives  we were able to align operating costs with the decline in revenue in the professional services business unit and achieve a significant increase in contribution margin

additionally  we were able to establish stand alone value for certain professional services  which allowed us to recognize the related revenue as the services were delivered rather than over the expected customer life 
we anticipate demand in the healthcare industry will grow as hospitals  physicians and the united states government move toward establishing electronic patient health and medical records which will require secure computerized databases and environments for storing and sharing of information 
our application services are designed to meet this demand for secure sharing of information which we believe will be a factor in the future growth of the covisint segment

during fiscal  our spending on the investments proportionally exceeded revenue growth  causing the decline in our contribution margin 
during fiscal  the increase in contribution margin was primarily due to economies of scale from our revenue growth

the million decrease in administrative and general expenses for fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to an increase of million in rental income recognized as a reduction in operating expenses as we entered into a five year agreement to lease approximately  square feet of our detroit  michigan headquarters effective april  a reduction of million in bonus expense  and a reduction of million in facility costs resulting from office consolidations in fiscal and fiscal the decrease in expenses was partially offset by a million increase in travel costs and a million increase in charitable contributions during fiscal restructuring charge there were no restructuring actions taken during fiscal or and at this time  there are no initiatives that require us to incur restructuring charges 
however  unanticipated future conditions or events may require us to reassess the need for new restructuring initiatives 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for payment activity related to our restructuring accrual 
during fiscal  the company incurred restructuring charges of million associated with two initiatives aligning the professional services segment headcount and operating expenses after initiating a plan to exit low margin engagements and increasing the operating efficiency of our products segment and administrative and general business processes with the goal of reducing operating expenses 
during the second half of fiscal  the professional services segment s business model was realigned resulting in the company exiting engagements considered low margin or unprofitable 
this change required the company to undertake restructuring actions to reduce headcount and operating expenses resulting in restructuring charges of million during fiscal employee termination costs were million due to the company eliminating professional services personnel and management positions 

table of contents the second initiative  to increase the operating efficiency of the company s products segment and administrative and general business processes  resulted in the company incurring restructuring charges of million during fiscal employee termination costs accounted for million of the charges due to the elimination of positions related to technology and sales and marketing personnel and corporate administrative and general positions 
facilities charges for fiscal primarily related to changes in sublease income assumptions associated with leased facilities that were abandoned in previous restructuring initiatives 
gain on divestiture of product lines gain on divestiture of product lines relates to the divestiture of our quality and testing business that occurred in may and resulted in a gain of million that was recognized during the first quarter of fiscal see note of the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information 
other income expense other income expense  net consists primarily of interest income realized from our cash and cash equivalents  interest earned on our financing receivables and income generated from our investment in a partially owned company offset by interest expense primarily associated with our long term debt 
settlement income relates to our settlement with ibm in march whereby ibm was committed to purchase software licenses and maintenance from the company totaling million over five years ending in fiscal million in fiscal  million in each of the following four years 
the amount of the annual commitment not used to purchase software licenses and maintenance was recorded to other income 
other income expense is presented in the table below in thousands period to period change year ended march  to to interest income interest expense settlement other other income expense other income expense declined million during fiscal as compared to fiscal the decline in interest income is primarily due to the decline in cash and cash equivalents related to cash paid for the dynatrace acquisition and to a lesser extent a decline in interest income related to our installment receivables 
the increase in interest expense is related to interest on borrowings under the line of credit 
borrowings were incurred primarily to fund a portion of the dynatrace acquisition 
the million decrease in other income from fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to the financial provisions of the ibm settlement agreement that expired on march  we recorded an ibm settlement gain of million in fiscal see note of the consolidated financial statements included in this report 

table of contents income taxes income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability approach 
deferred income taxes are provided for the differences between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements and net operating loss and credit carryforwards 
the income tax provision and effective tax rate are presented in the table below in thousands period to period change year ended march  to to income tax provision effective tax rate the company s effective tax rate was  and for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was impacted primarily by the following favorable items new legislation was enacted that amended michigan s income tax act to implement a comprehensive set of tax changes 
one part of the legislation contains provisions that replaced the michigan business tax mbt with a new corporate income tax 
certain credits allowed under the mbt  including the brownfield redevelopment tax credit  will continue to be effective  which allowed us to reduce our future tax liability for the duration of the carryforward period 
therefore  the valuation allowance associated with this deferred tax asset was reversed in fiscal all remaining issues with the internal revenue service were effectively settled related to the fiscal through fiscal tax periods 
the decrease in the effective rate for fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to an increase in tax credits realized during fiscal related to the us research and experimentation tax credit r d credit including the impact of retroactively reinstating the credit to january   and settlement of r d credits related to fiscal through fiscal tax periods with the internal revenue service 
see note of the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information regarding the difference between our effective tax rate and the statutory rate for fiscal  and management s discussion of critical accounting policies and estimates note of the consolidated financial statements included in this report contains a summary of our significant accounting policies 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
assumptions and estimates were based on facts and circumstances existing at march  however  future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
the accounting policies discussed below are considered by management to be the most important to an understanding of our financial statements  because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 

table of contents revenue recognition we generate revenue from licensing software products  providing maintenance and support services for those products  and rendering web performance  professional and application services 
our software solutions are comprised of license fees  maintenance fees  subscription fees and software related professional services fees 
we sometimes enter into arrangements that include both software related deliverables licensed software products  maintenance services or software related professional services and non software deliverables web performance services  professional services unrelated to our software products  or application services 
our web performance services and application services do not qualify as software deliverables because our license grant does not allow the customer the right or capability to take possession of the software 
for arrangements that contain both software and non software deliverables almost all of these arrangements combine software deliverables with web performance services  in accordance with asc revenue recognition  we allocate the arrangement consideration based on fair value using the following hierarchy vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe  meaning price when sold separately if available  third party evidence if vsoe is not available  or best estimated selling price if neither vsoe nor third party evidence is available 
we currently are unable to establish vsoe or third party evidence for our web performance services or software deliverables 
therefore  we create our best estimate of selling price by evaluating renewal amounts included in a contract  if any  and prices of deliverables sold separately  taking into consideration geography  volume discounts  and transaction size 
once we have allocated the arrangement between software deliverables and non software deliverables  we recognize revenue as described below in the respective product revenue recognition  web performance services fees and professional and application services fees sections 
in order for a transaction to be eligible for revenue recognition  the following revenue criteria must be met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we evaluate collectability based on past customer history  external credit ratings and payment terms within various customer agreements 
product revenue recognition we license software products using both perpetual and term time based licenses and provide maintenance services and software related professional services 
our software related professional services do not require significant production  modification or customization of the licensed software product 
assuming all revenue recognition criteria are met  perpetual license fee revenue is recognized upfront  using the residual method  under which the fair value of the undelivered elements eg  maintenance and software related services are deferred  based on vsoe of these elements 
vsoe is based on rates charged for maintenance and software related services when sold separately 
based on market conditions  we periodically change pricing methodologies for license  maintenance and software related services 
changes in rates charged for stand alone maintenance and software related services could have an impact on how bundled revenue agreements are characterized as license  maintenance or software related services or have an effect on the timing of revenue recognition in the future 
pricing modifications  if any  made during the years covered by this report have not had a significant impact on the timing or characterization of revenue recognized 
for revenue arrangements where there is a lack of vsoe for any undelivered elements  license fee revenue is deferred and recognized upon delivery of those elements or when vsoe can be established 
when maintenance or services are the only undelivered elements  the license fee revenue is recognized on a ratable basis over the longer of the maintenance term or over the period in which the services are expected to be performed 
such transactions include time based and unlimited capacity licenses as we do not sell maintenance separately and therefore cannot establish vsoe for the undelivered elements in these arrangements 
these arrangements do not qualify for separate recognition of the software license fees  maintenance fees and as applicable  professional services fees under asc however  to comply with sec regulation s x  rule b  which requires product  services and other categories of revenue to be displayed separately on the income statement  we separate the license fee  maintenance fee and professional services fee revenue based on our determination of relative fair value 
we apply our vsoe for maintenance related to perpetual license transactions and stand alone services arrangements as a reasonable and consistent approximation of fair value to separate license fee  maintenance fee and professional services fee revenue for income statement classification purposes 

table of contents we allow customers to have installment payment terms in our arrangements and generally  revenues from these transactions are recognized in the same manner as those requiring current payment 
this is because we have an established business practice of offering installment payment terms to customers and have a history of successfully enforcing original payment terms without making concessions 
however  because a significant portion of our license fee revenue is earned in connection with installment sales  changes in our customer collection experience  future economic conditions or technological developments could adversely affect our ability to immediately record license fees for these types of transactions and or limit our ability to collect these receivables 
when the license portion is paid over a number of years  the license portion of the payment stream is discounted to its net present value 
interest income is recognized over the payment term 
the maintenance revenue associated with all sales is deferred and is recognized over the applicable maintenance period 
web performance services fees our subscription fees relate to arrangements that permit our customers to access and utilize our web performance services 
the subscription arrangements do not provide customers the right to take possession of the software at any time  nor do the arrangements contain rights of return 
subscription fees are deferred upon contract execution and are recognized ratably over the term of the subscription 
professional services fees professional services fees are generally based on hourly or daily rates  therefore  revenues from professional services are recognized in the period the services are performed  provided that collection of the related receivable is deemed probable 
for development services rendered under a fixed price contract  revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method and if determined that costs will exceed revenue  the expected loss is recorded at the time the loss becomes apparent 
application services fees our application services fees consist of fees related to our covisint on demand software including associated professional services 
the arrangements do not provide customers the right to take possession of the software at any time  nor do the arrangements contain rights of return 
many of our application services fee contracts include a project fee and ongoing saas operations recurring fees 
the professional services related to these projects that have stand alone value eg  other vendors provide similar services qualify as a separate unit of accounting 
therefore  the professional services are recognized as delivered 
for those professional services that do not have stand alone value  the revenue is deferred and recognized over the longer of the customer arrangement generally one to three years or the expected period the customer will receive benefit generally five years 
the recurring fees are recognized over the applicable service period 
unforeseen events that result in additional time or costs being required to complete fixed price projects associated with either professional services or application services could affect the timing of revenue recognition for the balance of the project as well as margins going forward  and could have a negative effect on our results of operations 
capitalized software we follow the guidance of asc costs of software to be sold  leased  or marketed when capitalizing development costs associated with our software products and asc internal use software when capitalizing development costs associated with our web performance services and application services 
the cost of purchased and internally developed software technology is capitalized and stated at the lower of unamortized cost or expected net realizable value 
we compute annual amortization using the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the software technology which is generally three to five years 
software is subject to rapid technological obsolescence and future revenue estimates supporting the capitalized software cost can be negatively affected based upon competitive products  services and pricing 
such adverse developments could reduce the estimated net realizable value of our capitalized software and could result in impairment or a shorter estimated life 
such events would require us to take a charge in the period in which the event occurs or to increase the amortization expense in future periods and would have a negative effect on our results of operations 
at a minimum  we review for impairments each balance sheet date 

table of contents impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets we are required to assess the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may exceed the fair value 
the performance test involves a two step process 
step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values  including goodwill 
we measure the fair value of reporting units and other intangible assets using an estimate of the related discounted cash flow and market comparable valuations  where appropriate 
the discounted cash flow model uses significant assumptions  including projected future cash flows  the discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows  and a terminal growth rate 
the key assumptions in the market comparable value analysis are peer group selection and application of this peer group to the respective reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  the company performs step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of the respective reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
under such evaluation  if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  the impairment loss is recognized as an operating expense in an amount equal to that excess 
there is a high degree of judgment regarding management s forecast for the reporting units as market developments for both customers and competitors can affect actual results 
there can also be uncertainty regarding management s selection of peer companies as an exact match of peer companies is unlikely to exist 
application of the goodwill and other intangibles impairment test requires judgment  including the assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 
the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow model in combination with a market approach 
this analysis requires significant judgments  including estimation of future cash flows  which is dependent on internal forecasts  estimation of the long term rate of growth for our business  estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur  estimation of market interest rates  determination of our weighted average cost of capital and selection and application of peer groups 
the estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results  market conditions and estimated future cash flows 
while we believe that the assumptions and estimates used to determine the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units are reasonable  a change in assumptions underlying these estimates could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 
at march   none of our reporting units failed step of our goodwill impairment analysis 
our professional services reporting unit  with a goodwill balance of million  was the only reporting unit where the estimated fair value was not substantially in excess of the carrying value  as the fair value exceeded the carrying value by approximately at march  the fair value of the professional services reporting unit was estimated at the balance sheet date primarily using a discounted cash flow model 
assumptions used in the model that have the most significant effect are our estimated growth rates and estimated weighted average cost of capital 
the events and circumstances that could affect our key assumptions for the professional services reporting unit and the analysis of fair value include the following 
table of contents our ability to achieve sales productivity at a level to achieve the profitability in the forecast period 
failure of our billable staff to meet their utilization or rate targets 
our ability to hire and retain sales  technology and management personnel 
future negative changes in the us economies 
increased competition and pricing pressures within the professional services market 
deferred tax assets valuation allowance and tax liabilities income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for uncertain tax positions reflect management s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid 
we are subject to income taxes in both the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense 
deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial operations 
in projecting future taxable income  we develop assumptions including the amount of future state  federal and foreign pretax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences  and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
for additional information regarding these matters see note of the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
changes in estimates of projected future operating results or in assumptions regarding our ability to generate future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences are deductible could result in significant changes to these liabilities and  therefore  to our net income 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations 
we recognize tax benefits from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits 
we recognize tax liabilities in accordance with asc income taxes and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available 
due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined 
stock based compensation we measure compensation expense for stock awards in accordance with asc share based payment 
stock award compensation costs  net of an estimated forfeiture rate typically  are recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award  which is generally the vesting term of three to five years 
the fair value of stock options was estimated at the grant date using a black scholes option pricing model with the following average assumptions for fiscal risk free interest rate  volatility factor and expected option life years 
dividend yield is not a factor as we have never issued cash dividends and do not anticipate issuing cash dividends in the future 
the weighted average grant date fair value of option shares granted in fiscal was per option share 
if we increase the assumptions for the risk free interest rate and the volatility factor by percent in order to create a maximum compensation expense scenario  the fair value of stock options granted in fiscal would increase percent 
if the company decreased its assumptions for the risk free interest rate and the volatility factor by percent to create a minimum compensation expense scenario  the fair value of stock options granted in fiscal would decrease percent 

table of contents other other accounting policies  although not generally subject to the same level of estimation as those discussed above  are nonetheless important to an understanding of the financial statements 
many assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses require some degree of estimation or judgment in determining the appropriate accounting 
liquidity and capital resources as of march   and  cash and cash equivalents and investments totaled approximately million  million and million  respectively 
fiscal compared to fiscal net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal was million  an increase of million from fiscal the increase was primarily due to million in additional cash collections from customers resulting from the million increase in revenue from fiscal the increase in cash received was partially offset by an increase in cash paid to employees of million resulting from increased headcount to support the additional revenue and investments in our growth areas 
the consolidated statements of cash flows included in this report compute net cash from operating activities using the indirect cash flow method 
therefore  non cash adjustments and net changes in assets and liabilities net of effects from acquisitions  the divestiture and currency fluctuations are adjusted from net income to derive net cash from operating activities 
the most significant changes in our reconciliation of net income to derive net cash from operating activities during fiscal as compared to fiscal were as follows net income declined million  the impact of the net change in accounts payable and accrued expenses was million  and the depreciation and amortization adjustment to net income increased million 
the decline in net income is due to a larger increase in operating expenses than the increase in revenues for fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily related to additional investments in our apm and covisint business segments see results of operations discussion above for the changes in revenue and operating expense by business segment 
the increase from the net change in accounts payable and accrued expenses was due predominantly to bonus payments made during fiscal in excess of the payments made during fiscal the increase in depreciation and amortization was primarily due to the million in amortization expense recognized during fiscal on the intangible assets obtained from the dynatrace acquisition refer to note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information 
additionally  depreciation on our property  plant and equipment increased million and amortization on our capitalized research and development projects increased million during fiscal as compared to fiscal we believe our existing cash resources and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet operating cash needs for the foreseeable future 
net cash used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities during fiscal was million  which represents an increase of million from fiscal  and is due primarily to the acquisition of dynatrace see note of the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
this transaction resulted in a million use of cash during the second quarter of the increase was partially offset by the acquisition of docsite during the second quarter of for million in cash and the acquisition of bez systems  inc during the third quarter of for million in cash 
the remaining change was due to the purchase of million of capitalized software during the second quarter of and million in additional research and development costs capitalized during fiscal related primarily to our apm and application services segments 
capital expenditures were funded with cash flows from operations 

table of contents we will continue to evaluate business acquisition opportunities that fit our strategic plans 
if the cash consideration for a future acquisition or combination of acquisitions were to exceed our operating cash balance resources  we would likely utilize our credit facility again and may need to seek additional financing 
net cash provided by financing activities net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal was million  which represents an increase of million from fiscal the increase was primarily due to the following during the second and third quarters of  we borrowed a total of million under our revolving credit facility primarily related to financing for the dynatrace acquisition  of which million has been repaid  we repurchased million in stock during fiscal  as compared to million during fiscal  and there was a million reduction in cash received from employees exercising stock options during fiscal as compared to fiscal since may  the board of directors has authorized the company to repurchase a total of billion of our common stock under a discretionary stock repurchase plan discretionary plan 
purchases of common stock under the discretionary plan may occur on the open market  or through negotiated or block transactions based upon market and business conditions  subject to applicable legal limitations 
during fiscal  we repurchased under the discretionary plan approximately million shares of our common stock at an average price of per share for a total cost of million 
in anticipation of the acquisition of dynatrace  we temporarily suspended repurchases under the discretionary plan during the first quarter of  but resumed our repurchase program initiative during the second quarter of during the third quarter  we chose to deploy our cash to reduce the outstanding debt balance related to the dynatrace acquisition  and resumed repurchase activity under the discretionary plan in the fourth quarter of our long term goal is to reduce our outstanding common share count to approximately million shares  though we may adjust our goals based on our cash position and market conditions 
share repurchases are funded primarily through our operating cash flow and  if needed  funds from our credit facility 
as of march   approximately million remains authorized for future purchases 
in may  the board of directors authorized a rule b repurchase program to be implemented during the first quarter of fiscal which will allow us to repurchase shares pursuant to a predetermined formula without regard to the quarterly black out periods 
this plan will utilize funds under the previous authorization described above and will expire in november the company has an unsecured revolving credit agreement the credit facility with comerica bank and other lenders to provide leverage for the company if needed 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the credit facility 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we extended the credit facility through march  the timing for ultimate repayment of the amount currently outstanding will depend on cash flows and share repurchases 
fiscal compared to fiscal net cash provided by operating activities 
table of contents net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal was million  a decrease of million from fiscal the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in customer cash collections of million as our strategy to exit low margin professional services engagements has reduced our cash collections related to professional services during and  and the decline in our mainframe product revenue 
the decrease in cash was further impacted by an increase in employee bonus and commission payments of approximately million during fiscal the decrease was partially offset by a million decline in income taxes paid to taxing authorities due to the decline in pre tax net income in fiscal as compared to fiscal and an increase in rental income receipts and reductions in building rent payments during fiscal the decrease in the net change of accounts receivable was million and primarily relates to the timing of billings from multi year product arrangements during fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in the net change of deferred revenue was million and primarily relates to the decline in mainframe license and maintenance contracts 
the other significant changes in our reconciliation of net income to derive net cash from operating activities during fiscal as compared to fiscal were as follows the adjustment to net income of million resulting from the gain relating to the quality divestiture during the first quarter of the proceeds from the sale were recorded to investing activities  the change in accounts payable and accrued expense balances decreased cash flow from operating activities by million  and was primarily a result of the increase in employee bonus payments during the first quarter of that were accrued for at march   and the change in deferred income taxes which increased cash provided by operating activities by million primarily due to timing differences resulting from increases in capitalized internal software costs and deferred portal customer implementation costs 
net cash used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities during fiscal was million  a decrease of million from fiscal the primary reason for the decrease was the decline in cash used for acquisitions 
we acquired gomez in fiscal for million compared to million used for acquisitions during fiscal the decrease was partially offset by the receipt of million from the quality divestiture during the first quarter of fiscal during fiscal and fiscal  capital expenditures for property and equipment and capitalized research and software development totaled million and million  respectively  with million of the increase due primarily to computer and network equipment purchases and million of the increase due to increases in capitalized internal software costs related to our software products and web performance services 
capital expenditures were funded with cash flows from operations 
net cash used in financing activities net cash used in financing activities during fiscal was million  a decrease of million from fiscal the decrease was primarily due to a million increase in cash receipts from employees exercising stock options primarily related to a broad based stock option grant bbso grant that expired in april during the second half of fiscal  our stock price exceeded the exercise price of this bbso grant causing an increase in stock option exercise activity 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in common stock repurchases of million during fiscal as compared to fiscal recently issued accounting pronouncements see note of the consolidated financial statements included in this report for recently issued accounting pronouncements that could affect the company 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our payments under contractual obligations as of march  in thousands payment due by period as of march  and total thereafter contractual obligations operating leases long term debt other total other includes commitments under various advertising and charitable contribution agreements totaling million and  respectively  at march  for additional information related to the outstanding debt under the credit agreement  see note of the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
there are no long term capital lease obligations or purchase obligations 
we anticipate tax settlements of million with certain taxing authorities of which  is expected to be settled in the upcoming twelve months as discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
we are not able to reasonably estimate in which future periods the remaining amount of million will ultimately be settled 
these settlements are not included in the contractual obligations table above 
off balance sheet arrangements we currently do not have any off balance sheet or non consolidated special purpose entity arrangements as defined by the applicable sec rules 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed primarily to market risks associated with movements in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we believe that we take the necessary steps to manage the potential impact of interest rate and foreign exchange exposures on our financial position and operating performance 
we do not use derivative financial instruments or forward foreign exchange contracts for investment  speculative or trading purposes 
immediate changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates discussed in the following paragraphs are hypothetical rate scenarios used to calibrate risk and do not currently represent management s view of future market developments 
a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments is included in note of the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
interest rate risk exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash investments and installment receivables 
derivative financial instruments are not a part of our investment strategy 
cash investments are placed with high quality issuers to preserve invested funds by limiting default and market risk 
our investment portfolio consists of cash investments that have a cost basis and fair value totaling million as of march  the average interest rate and average tax equivalent interest rate were as of march  these investments will mature within the next three months 

table of contents we offer financing arrangements with installment payment terms in connection with our multi year software sales 
installment accounts are generally receivable over a two to five year period 
as of march   non current accounts receivable amounted to million  of which approximately million  million  million  million and million are due in fiscal through fiscal  respectively 
the fair value of non current accounts receivable is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rate at which the company would finance a similar transaction 
at march   the fair value of such receivables is approximately million 
each basis point increase in interest rates would have an associated  negative impact on the fair value of non current accounts receivable based on the balance of such receivables at march  each basis point decrease in interest rates would have an associated  positive impact on the fair value of non current accounts receivable based on the balance of such receivables at march  at march   the fair value of such receivables was approximately million 
each basis point increase in interest rates would have had an associated  negative impact on the fair value of non current accounts receivable based on the balance of such receivables at march  each basis point decrease in interest rates would have an associated  positive impact on the fair value of non current accounts receivable based on the balance of such receivables at march  a change in interest rates will have no impact on cash flows or net income associated with non current accounts receivable 
foreign currency risk we are exposed to foreign exchange rate risks related to assets and liabilities that are denominated in non local currency and current inter company balances due to and from our foreign subsidiaries 
we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to sell or buy currencies with the intent of mitigating foreign exchange rate risks related to these balances 
we do not currently hedge currency risk related to anticipated revenue or expenses denominated in foreign currency 
all foreign exchange derivatives are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value see note of the consolidated financial statements 
gains and losses on foreign exchange forward contracts are recognized in income  offsetting foreign exchange gains or losses on the foreign balances being hedged 
at march   we performed a sensitivity analysis to assess the potential loss that a positive or negative change in foreign currency exchange rates would have on our income from operations 
based upon the analysis performed  we believe such a change would not materially affect our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
