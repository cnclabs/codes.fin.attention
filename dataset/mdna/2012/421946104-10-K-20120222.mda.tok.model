overview business overview healthcare realty s strategy is to own and operate medical office and other medical related facilities that produce stable and growing rental income 
additionally  the company provides a broad spectrum of services to develop  lease  finance and manage its portfolio of healthcare properties 
the company focuses its portfolio on outpatient related facilities located on or near the campuses of large acute care hospitals and associated with leading health systems because management views these facilities as stable  lower risk real estate investments 
the company s diversity of geography and tenants  which includes nearly two dozen physician specialties  as well as surgery  imaging  and diagnostic centers  helps mitigate exposure to credit risk  changes in tenant clinical practice  reimbursement levels  and fluctuating economic conditions

development activity the company had several development projects ongoing at december   including three construction projects  four construction mortgage loans and properties in the process of stabilization subsequent to construction 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more detail on these projects 
the company s ability to complete and stabilize these facilities in a given period of time will impact the company s results of operations and cash flows 
more favorable completion dates  stabilization periods and rental rates will result in improved results of operations and cash flows  while lagging completion dates  stabilization periods and rental rates will result in less favorable results of operations and cash flows 
the company s disclosures regarding projections or estimates of completion dates and leasing may not reflect actual results 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the company s development activities 
beyond the current commitments  the company has no new development starts planned 
however  the company is regularly in discussions with health systems  developers and others that could lead to attractive development opportunities 
the company will consider these projects in light of existing obligations  the acquisition environment  capital availability and cost  and other factors 
dispositions and impairments during  the company disposed of five real estate properties for approximately million in net proceeds and recognized approximately million in gains and approximately million in impairments from the sale of the properties 
also  two mortgage notes receivable totaling approximately million were repaid 
upon repayment of one of the mortgage notes receivables  the company recognized a gain of million that had been deferred from the original sale of the building to the borrower in proceeds from these dispositions were used to repay amounts due under the company s unsecured credit facilities  to fund additional real estate investments  and for general corporate purposes

during  of the leases in the company s multi tenanted buildings expired of which approximately were renewed or the tenants continue to occupy the space 
an additional leases in the company s multi tenanted portfolio will expire during approximately of the leases expiring in are located in buildings on hospital campuses 
the expirations are distributed throughout the portfolio and are not concentrated with any one tenant  health system or location 
master leases on five of the company s properties expired during three of the tenants renewed their leases  and the company assumed the subtenant leases and management of the other two properties operations 
the aggregate net operating income on the five buildings is expected to be approximately million per quarter lower than under the previous master leases 
in addition to these five properties  one other master leased property  whose lease was set to expire during the year  was sold 
master leases on three  single tenanted properties are scheduled to expire during an agreement in principle has been reached but not executed on one of the properties whose master lease expires in february the terms of the amended lease on this  square foot property will extend the expiration of the lease for an additional two years at the same lease rate with annual increases in the lease rate 
negotiations are on going relating to the renewal of the remaining two master leased properties 
the properties include a  square foot property with a lease expiration in july and a  square foot property with a lease expiration in july financial support payments totaling approximately million per quarter expired on september  on two of the company s properties in new orleans 
since hurricane katrina struck in august  the company received a series of payments totaling million under the financial support agreements 
the company s total investment in the two buildings was approximately million million  net at december  the buildings  which aggregate approximately  square feet  are adjacent to the former methodist hospital in east new orleans which has remained closed since hurricane katrina 
the city of new orleans purchased the hospital and formed a partnership with a health system to open and operate the hospital in the future  which the company expects will provide additional occupancy in the buildings 
lease renewal rates due to the non fungible nature and high occupancy of the company s principal asset type on campus  medical office buildings the company continues to see positive re leasing spreads across its portfolio 
for newly executed leases in  the quarterly weighted average rent increases ranged from to 
the company has seen these positive leasing spreads every quarter for several years and has been able to increase rents throughout the economic downturn 
tenant improvements in most markets  subject to the terms of the lease  the company may provide a tenant improvement allowance in the lease rental rate for the purpose of refurbishing or renovating second generation tenant space 
shorter term leases one to two years generally do not involve a tenant improvement allowance 
where a tenant improvement allowance is offered  the typical allowance is approximately per square foot per year of term 
tenant improvement allowances for first generation tenant space are approximately to per square foot 
if tenants spend more than the allowance  the company generally offers the tenant the option to either amortize the overage over the lease term  with interest  or reimburse the overage to the company in a lump sum 
in either case  such overage reimbursements are amortized by the company as rent over the term of the lease 
interest earned on tenant overages is included in other operating income in the company s statement of operations and totaled approximately million in the tenant overage amount amortized to rent in totaled approximately million 
leasing commissions the company manages the majority of its real estate portfolio and handles most of its leasing in house 
in certain markets  the company may pay leasing commissions to real estate brokers who represent either the company s properties or prospective tenants 
where the company does pay leasing commissions  the commission will generally equate to of the gross lease value for new leases 
in  the company paid approximately million in leasing commissions  which will be amortized to rent over the term of the lease 

table of contents rent concessions rent concessions are sometimes used to help induce a potential tenant or renewing tenant to lease space in the company s properties 
in most cases  rent concessions are only offered with respect to currently vacant space 
concessions generally take the form of deferred rent 
such concessions  when made  are amortized by the company on a straight line basis against rental income over the lease term 
some markets have experienced softening in rates as general office and retail landlords seek medical tenants to help solve their vacancy issues 
driven also by reimbursement uncertainty and the introduction of tenant representative real estate brokers  in recent quarters the company has seen increased interest in rent concessions from its existing and prospective tenants 
rent concessions on the multi tenant and stabilizing portfolio totaled approximately million in and million in discontinued operations as discussed in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  a company must present the results of operations of real estate assets disposed of or held for sale as discontinued operations 
therefore  the results of operations from such assets are classified as discontinued operations for the current period  and all prior periods presented are restated to conform to the current period presentation 
readers of the company s consolidated financial statements should be aware that each future disposal will result in a change to the presentation of the company s operations in the historical consolidated statements of operations as previously filed 
such reclassifications to the consolidated statements of operations will have no impact on previously reported net income attributable to common stockholders 
other items impacting operations several events that occurred in the fourth quarter of or will occur in the first quarter of may impact the company s operations and financial results in the company typically has higher general and administrative costs in the first quarter of every year as a result of the publication of its annual report and proxy 
in addition  the company records an expense related to the grant of employee stock purchase plan options every january 
these items will likely increase general and administrative expenses by approximately million in the first quarter 
renewals of three master leases during the fourth quarter of were executed at slightly lower base lease rates 
the impact of these renewals will initially lower master lease income and straight line rent by approximately million per quarter 
in december  the company sold two properties in massachusetts for million and recorded a gain of million 
the sale of these two properties will reduce master lease income by nearly million per quarter 
the company s utility costs are a large component of property operating expense and can vary widely quarter to quarter depending on weather conditions in areas where the company owns and manages properties 
for  the average utility expense per quarter for the properties included in the company s same store analysis was approximately million 
because of milder temperatures experienced throughout much of the country in the fourth quarter  the company s utility expense for those same properties was only million 
the company cannot predict if these weather conditions will continue  so property operating expense in the first quarter of may be higher than the previous quarter s results 
fourth quarter results included partially reserved revenue that was recovered through a settlement with a former tenant 
the settlement totaling approximately million increased property operating income by approximately million and reduced bad debt expense by approximately million in the fourth quarter of at the market equity offering program since december  the company has had in place an at the market equity offering program to sell shares of the company s common stock from time to time in at the market sales transactions

funds from operations funds from operations ffo and ffo per share are operating performance measures adopted by the national association of real estate investment trusts  inc nareit 
nareit defines ffo as the most commonly accepted and reported measure of a reit s operating performance equal to net income computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
the sec indicated in that impairment charges losses could not be added back to net income attributable to common stockholders in calculating ffo 
however  in late october  nareit issued an alert indicating that the sec staff recently advised nareit that it currently takes no position on the matter of whether impairment charges should be added back to net income to compute ffo  and nareit affirmed its original definition of ffo 
for  the company is following the nareit definition to exclude impairment charges and has restated all prior periods to exclude impairment charges in calculating ffo and ffo per share to agree with the presentation 
the comparability of ffo for the year ended december  compared to was affected by the various acquisitions and dispositions of the company s real estate portfolio and the results of operations of the portfolio from period to period  as well as from the commencement of operations of properties that were previously under construction 
also  interest expense increased million  or per diluted common share  in compared to largely due to interest incurred from the issuance in december of the million of senior notes due whose proceeds were partially used to pre fund the redemption of the senior notes due the company incurred interest on both senior note issuances for effectively four months of other items that impacted the comparability of ffo are discussed below in results of operations 
management believes ffo and ffo per share to be supplemental measures of a reit s performance because they provide an understanding of the operating performance of the company s properties without giving effect to certain significant non cash items  primarily depreciation and amortization expense 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
however  real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions 
the company believes that by excluding the effect of depreciation  amortization and gains or losses from sales of real estate  all of which are based on historical costs and which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance  ffo and ffo per share can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods 
the company reports ffo and ffo per share because these measures are observed by management to also be the predominant measures used by the reit industry and by industry analysts to evaluate reits and because ffo per share is consistently reported  discussed  and compared by research analysts in their notes and publications about reits 
for these reasons  management has deemed it appropriate to disclose and discuss ffo and ffo per share 
however  ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income attributable to common stockholders as an indicator of the company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity

in january  an inpatient facility under construction in south dakota that was being funded by the company through a mortgage note was sold 
as a result  the company s mortgage note was repaid in full 
the company began consolidating the variable interest entity that owned the ongoing construction project in the third quarter of when the company concluded it was the primary beneficiary of the entity  resulting in the elimination of the construction mortgage loan in the consolidated financial statements 
the balance in the construction project at december  was approximately million 
amounts outstanding on the mortgage note receivable totaled approximately million at december  the company does not anticipate a material gain or loss in connection with the deconsolidation of the project 
potential dispositions in the fourth quarter of  the company received notice from a tenant of its intent to purchase six skilled nursing facilities in michigan and indiana pursuant to purchase options contained in its leases with the company 
the company s aggregate net investment in the buildings  which were classified as held for sale upon receiving notice of the purchase option exercise  was approximately million at december   and the aggregate contractual rent on the facilities is approximately million per quarter 
the aggregate purchase price for the properties is expected to be approximately million  resulting in an expected aggregate net gain of approximately million 
the company expects the sales will close in during the fourth quarter of  management decided to sell seven properties in the company s portfolio 
in connection with its planned disposal of these properties  the company determined that the carrying value for four of these properties would not likely be fully recoverable upon sale 
accordingly  the company recorded an aggregate impairment charge on these properties of approximately million  reducing the aggregate net investment in the properties to approximately million 
of the seven properties identified for disposal  four of the properties are located in texas and three are located in florida 
three of the seven properties were sold during january  and the remaining four  two of which are under contract  are expected to be sold during the company may from time to time sell additional properties and redeploy cash from the property sales and mortgage repayments into investments 
to the extent revenues related to the properties being sold and the mortgages being repaid exceed income from these investments  the company s results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

table of contents purchase options in addition to the six skilled nursing facilities in michigan and indiana discussed above  the company had million in real estate properties at december  that were subject to exercisable purchase options that had not been exercised 
on a probability weighted basis  the company estimates that less than one third of these options might ever be exercised in the future 
purchase options on four properties in which the company had an aggregate gross investment of approximately million at december  become exercisable during and the company does not believe it can reasonably estimate at this time the probability that these purchase options will be exercised in the future 
development activity the company had several development projects ongoing at december   including three construction projects  four construction mortgage loans and properties in the process of stabilization subsequent to construction 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more detail on these projects

 total amount funded through dec 
 estimated remaining fundings estimated total investment approximate square feet construction in progress construction mortgage loans stabilization in progress land held for development total includes one construction mortgage loan that the company was consolidating under consolidation accounting principles 
the building under construction was sold by the owner in january the company intends to fund these commitments with available cash on hand  cash flows from operations  proceeds from the unsecured credit facility  proceeds from the sale of real estate properties  or proceeds from repayments of mortgage notes receivable 
operating leases as of december   the company was obligated under operating lease agreements consisting primarily of the company s corporate office lease and ground leases related to real estate investments  excluding leases the company has prepaid 
these operating leases have expiration dates through rental expense relating to the operating leases for the years ended december   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
dividends the company is required to pay dividends to its stockholders at least equal to of its taxable income in order to maintain its qualification as a reit 
common stock cash dividends paid during or related to are shown in the table below quarter quarterly dividend date of declaration date of record date paid payable th quarter february  february  march  st quarter may  may  june  nd quarter august  august  september  rd quarter november  november  december  th quarter january  february  march  the ability of the company to pay dividends is dependent upon its ability to generate cash flows and to make accretive new investments 
liquidity net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the company s cash flows are dependent upon rental rates on leases  occupancy levels of the multi tenanted buildings  acquisition and disposition activity during the year  and the level of operating expenses  among other factors 
the company expects to continue to meet its liquidity needs  including funding additional investments in  paying dividends  repaying maturing debt and funding other debt service 
liquidity sources available include cash on hand  cash flows from operations  borrowings under the unsecured credit facility  proceeds from mortgage notes receivable repayments  proceeds from sales of 
table of contents real estate investments  or additional capital market financings  including the company s at the market equity offering program  or other debt or equity offerings 
the company also had unencumbered real estate assets with a cost of approximately billion at december   which could serve as collateral for secured mortgage financing 
the company believes that its liquidity and sources of capital are adequate to satisfy its cash requirements 
the company cannot  however  be certain that these sources of funds will be available at a time and upon terms acceptable to the company in sufficient amounts to meet its liquidity needs 
the company has some exposure to variable interest rates and its stock price has been impacted by the volatility in the stock markets 
however  the company s leases  which provide its main source of income and cash flow  have terms of approximately to years and have lease rates that generally increase on an annual basis at fixed rates or based on consumer price indices 
impact of inflation inflation has not significantly affected the company s earnings due to the moderate inflation rate in recent years and the fact that most of the company s leases and financial support arrangements require tenants and sponsors to pay all or some portion of the increases in operating expenses  thereby reducing the company s risk to the adverse effects of inflation 
in addition  inflation has the effect of increasing gross revenue the company is to receive under the terms of certain leases and financial support arrangements 
leases and financial support arrangements vary in the remaining terms of obligations  further reducing the company s risk to any adverse effects of inflation 
interest payable under the unsecured credit facility is calculated at a variable rate  therefore  the amount of interest payable under the unsecured credit facility is influenced by changes in short term rates  which tend to be sensitive to inflation 
during periods where interest rate increases outpace inflation  the company s operating results should be negatively impacted 
conversely  when increases in inflation outpace increases in interest rates  the company s operating results should be positively impacted 
new accounting pronouncements note to the consolidated financial statements provides a discussion of new accounting standards 
the company does not believe these new standards will have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements  cash flows or results of operations 

table of contents market risk the company is exposed to market risk in the form of changing interest rates on its debt and mortgage notes receivable 
management uses regular monitoring of market conditions and analysis techniques to manage this risk 
at december   billion of the company s billion of outstanding debt bore interest at fixed rates 
additionally  all of the company s mortgage notes and other notes receivable bore interest at fixed rates 
the following table provides information regarding the sensitivity of certain of the company s financial instruments  as described above  to market conditions and changes resulting from changes in interest rates

application of critical accounting policies to accounting estimates the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap and the rules and regulations of the sec 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  management is required to exercise judgment and make assumptions that impact the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses reflected in the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents management routinely evaluates the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
these regular evaluations consider historical experience and other reasonable factors and use the seasoned judgment of management personnel 
management has reviewed the company s critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
management believes the following paragraphs in this section describe the application of critical accounting policies by management to arrive at the critical accounting estimates reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
the company s accounting policies are more fully discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
principles of consolidation the company s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company  its wholly owned subsidiaries  joint ventures  partnerships and variable interest entities vies where the company controls the operating activities 
all material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated 
management must make judgments regarding the company s level of influence or control over an entity and whether or not the company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity 
consideration of various factors includes  but is not limited to  the company s ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance  the company s form of ownership interest  the company s representation on the entity s governing body  the size and seniority of the company s investment  the company s ability and the rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions  the company s ability to replace the manager and or liquidate the entity 
management s ability to correctly assess its influence or control over an entity when determining the primary beneficiary of a vie affects the presentation of these entities in the company s consolidated financial statements 
if it is determined that the company is the primary beneficiary of a vie  the company s consolidated financial statements would include the operating results of the vie rather than the results of the variable interest in the vie 
the company would depend on the vie to provide timely financial information and would rely on the interest control of the vie to provide accurate financial information 
untimely or inaccurate financial information provided to the company or deficiencies in the vies internal controls over financial reporting could impact the company s consolidated financial statements and its internal control over financial reporting 
capitalization of costs gaap generally allows for the capitalization of various types of costs 
the rules and regulations on capitalizing costs and the subsequent depreciation or amortization of those costs versus expensing them in the period incurred vary depending on the type of costs and the reason for capitalizing the costs 
direct costs of a development project generally include construction costs  professional services such as architectural and legal costs  travel expenses  land acquisition costs as well as other types of fees and expenses 
these costs are capitalized as part of the basis of an asset to which such costs relate 
indirect costs include capitalized interest and overhead costs 
the company s overhead costs are based on overhead load factors that are charged to a project based on direct time incurred 
the company computes the overhead load factors annually for its acquisition and development departments  which have employees who are involved in the projects 
the overhead load factors are computed to absorb that portion of indirect employee costs payroll and benefits  training  occupancy and similar costs that are attributable to the productive time the employee incurs working directly on projects 
the employees in the company s acquisitions and development departments who work on these projects maintain and report their hours daily  by project 
employee costs that are administrative  such as vacation time  sick time  or general and administrative time  are expensed in the period incurred 
acquisition related costs of an existing building include finder s fees  advisory  legal  accounting  valuation  other professional or consulting fees  and certain general and administrative costs 
these costs are also expensed in the period incurred 
management s judgment is also exercised in determining whether costs that have been previously capitalized to a project should be reserved for or written off if or when the project is abandoned or circumstances otherwise change that would call the project s viability into question 
the company follows a standard and consistently applied policy of classifying pursuit activity as well as reserving for these types of costs based on their classification 
the company classifies its pursuit projects into four categories  of which three relate to development and one relates to acquisitions 
the first category includes pursuits of developments that have a remote chance of producing new business 
costs for these projects are expensed in the period incurred 
the second category includes pursuits of developments that might reasonably be expected to produce new business opportunities although there can be no assurance that they will result in a new project or contract 
costs for these projects are capitalized but  due to the uncertainty of projects in this category  these costs are reserved at  which means that of the costs are expensed in the period incurred 
the third category includes those pursuits of developments that are either highly probable to result in a project or contract or already have resulted in a project or contract in which the contract requires the operator to reimburse the company s costs 
many times  these are pursuits involving operators with which the company is already doing business 
since the company believes it is probable that these pursuits will result in a project or contract  it capitalizes these costs in full and records no reserve 
the fourth category includes pursuits that involve the acquisition of existing buildings 
as discussed above  costs related to acquisitions of existing buildings are expensed in the period incurred 

table of contents each quarter  all capitalized pursuit costs are again reviewed carefully for viability or a change in classification  and a management decision is made as to whether any additional reserve is deemed necessary 
if necessary and considered appropriate  management would record an additional reserve at that time 
capitalized pursuit costs  net of the reserve  are carried in other assets in the company s consolidated balance sheets  and any reserve recorded is charged to general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations 
all pursuit costs will ultimately be written off to expense or capitalized as part of the constructed real estate asset 
as of december  and  the company had capitalized pursuit costs totaling million which were fully reserved and million million  net of reserves  respectively 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill the company assesses the potential for impairment of identifiable intangible assets and long lived assets  including real estate properties  whenever events occur or a change in circumstances indicates that the recorded value might not be fully recoverable 
important factors that could cause management to review for impairment include significant underperformance of an asset relative to historical or expected operating results  significant changes in the company s use of assets or the strategy for its overall business  plans to sell an asset before its depreciable life has ended  or significant negative economic trends or negative industry trends for the company or its operators 
in addition  the company reviews for possible impairment  those assets subject to purchase options and those impacted by casualties  such as hurricanes 
if management determines that the carrying value of the company s assets may not be fully recoverable based on the existence of any of the factors above  or others  management would measure and record an impairment charge based on the estimated fair value of the property 
the company recorded impairment charges totaling million  million and  respectively  for the years ended december   and related to real estate properties and other long lived assets 
the impairment charges in included million related to two properties sold in and million related to five properties classified as held for sale in  reducing the company s carrying values on the properties to the estimated fair values of the properties less costs to sell 
the impairment charges in included million related to one property sold in and million related to five properties classified as held for sale in  reducing the company s carrying values on the properties to the estimated fair values of the properties less costs to sell 
one of the properties classified as held for sale during was re leased during and was reclassified to held for use  resulting in a reclassification of a million impairment charge recorded in on the property from discontinued operations to continuing operations 
the impairment charge in was recorded in connection with the sale of a property in washington 
the company also performs an annual goodwill impairment review 
the company s reviews are performed as of december of each year 
the company s and reviews indicated that no impairment had occurred with the respect to the company s million goodwill asset 
depreciation of real estate assets and amortization of related intangible assets as of december   the company had investments of approximately billion in depreciable real estate assets and related intangible assets 
when real estate assets and related intangible assets are acquired or placed in service  they must be depreciated or amortized 
management s judgment involves determining which depreciation method to use  estimating the economic life of the building and improvement components of real estate assets  and estimating the value of intangible assets acquired when real estate assets are purchased that have in place leases 
as described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  when the company acquires real estate properties with in place leases  the cost of the acquisition must be allocated between the acquired tangible real estate assets as if vacant and any acquired intangible assets 
such intangible assets could include above or below market in place leases and at market in place leases  which could include the opportunity costs associated with absorption period rentals  direct costs associated with obtaining new leases such as tenant improvements  and customer relationship assets 
any remaining excess purchase price is then allocated to goodwill 
the identifiable tangible and intangible assets are then subject to depreciation and amortization 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis unless circumstances suggest that a more frequent evaluation is warranted 
if assumptions used to estimate the as if vacant value of the building or the intangible asset values prove to be inaccurate  the pro ration of the purchase price between building and intangibles and resulting depreciation and amortization could be incorrect 
the amortization period for the intangible assets is the average remaining term of the actual in place leases as of the acquisition date 
to help prevent errors in its estimates from occurring  management applies consistent assumptions with regard to the elements of estimating the as if vacant values of the building and the intangible assets  including the absorption period  occupancy increases during the absorption period  and tenant improvement amounts 
the company uses the same absorption period and occupancy assumptions for similar building types  adding the future cash flows expected to occur over the next years as a fully occupied building 
the net present value of these future cash flows  discounted using a market rate of return  becomes the estimated as if vacant value of the building 

table of contents with respect to the building components  there are several depreciation methods available under gaap 
some methods record relatively more depreciation expense on an asset in the early years of the asset s economic life  and relatively less depreciation expense on the asset in the later years of its economic life 
the straight line method of depreciating real estate assets is the method the company follows because  in the opinion of management  it is the method that most accurately and consistently allocates the cost of the asset over its estimated life 
the company assigns a useful life to its owned buildings based on many factors  including the age of the property when acquired 
allowance for doubtful accounts and credit losses many of the company s investments are subject to long term leases or other financial support arrangements with hospital systems and healthcare providers affiliated with the properties 
due to the nature of the company s agreements  the company s accounts receivable  notes receivable and interest receivables result mainly from monthly billings of contractual tenant rents  lease guaranty amounts  principal and interest payments due on notes and mortgage notes receivable  late fees and additional rent 
payments on the company s accounts receivable are normally collected within days of billing 
when receivables remain uncollected  management must decide whether it believes the receivable is collectible and whether to provide an allowance for all or a portion of these receivables 
unlike a financial institution with a large volume of homogeneous retail receivables such as credit card loans or automobile loans that have a predictable loss pattern over time  the company s receivable losses have historically been infrequent  and are tied to a unique or specific event 
the company s allowance for doubtful accounts is generally based on specific identification and is recorded for a specific receivable amount once determined that such an allowance is needed 
the company also evaluates collectability of its mortgage notes and notes receivable 
a loan is impaired when it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan as scheduled  including both contractual interest and principal payments 
the company recorded approximately a million allowance on one of its notes receivable during but did not record allowances on any of its mortgage notes or notes receivable during or management monitors the age and collectability of receivables on an ongoing basis 
at least monthly  a report is produced whereby all receivables are aged or placed into groups based on the number of days that have elapsed since the receivable was billed 
management reviews the aging report for evidence of deterioration in the timeliness of payments from tenants  sponsors or borrowers 
whenever deterioration is noted  management investigates and determines the reason s for the delay  which may include discussions with the delinquent tenant  sponsor or borrower 
considering all information gathered  management s judgment must be exercised in determining whether a receivable is potentially uncollectible and  if so  how much or what percentage may be uncollectible 
among the factors management considers in determining uncollectibility are the following type of contractual arrangement under which the receivable was recorded  eg  a mortgage note  a triple net lease  a gross lease  a sponsor guaranty agreement or some other type of agreement  tenant s or debtor s reason for slow payment  industry influences and healthcare segment under which the tenant or debtor operates  evidence of willingness and ability of the tenant or debtor to pay the receivable  credit worthiness of the tenant or debtor  collateral  security deposit  letters of credit or other monies held as security  tenant s or debtor s historical payment pattern  other contractual agreements between the tenant or debtor and the company  relationship between the tenant or debtor and the company  state in which the tenant or debtor operates  and existence of a guarantor and the willingness and ability of the guarantor to pay the receivable 
considering these factors and others  management must conclude whether all or some of the aged receivable balance is likely uncollectible 
if management determines that some portion of a receivable is likely uncollectible  the company records a provision for bad debt expense for the amount expected to be uncollectible 
there is a risk that management s estimate is over or under stated  
table of contents however  management believes that this risk is mitigated by the fact that it re evaluates the allowance at least once each quarter and bases its estimates on the most current information available 
as such  any over or under stated estimates in the allowance should be adjusted for as soon as new and better information becomes available
