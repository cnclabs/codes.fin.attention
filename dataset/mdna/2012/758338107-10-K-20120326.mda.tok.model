item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion and analysis may contain forward looking statements based on assumptions about our future business 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including but not limited to those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we continued to experience significant increases in sales of our branded products in  and we anticipate that those increases will continue into our gross margin on sales of branded products and private label products improved in  and we feel that the gross margin percentage will remain constant in  with increasing sales 
our branded sales increases are driven by new distributor relationships in key regions  as well as expanded sales to our direct customers 
private label opportunities are numerous and our capabilities are increasing  so that we can accommodate growth in this segment of our business 
we have adequate capital for our existing business and we are increasing margin contribution without significant increases in operating and sales costs 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales sales of  for the year ended december  represented an increase of  or  as compared to the prior year same period 
sales from branded products increased over during  over  with an overall volume increase of in our core ounce branded beverages 
sales of private label products increased to approximately million in  an increase of approximately over sales increases are due to higher volumes with key customers as well as the addition of several regional direct store delivery dsd distributors selling our products 
both branded and private label sales are anticipated to increase further in cost of tangible goods sold cost of tangible goods sold consists of the costs of raw materials and packaging utilized in the manufacture of products  co packing fees  repacking fees  in bound freight charges  as well as certain internal transfer costs 
the total cost of  for the year december  decreased  as a percentage of sales  to as compared to of sales in the prior year 
despite price increases in certain key raw ingredients  we were able to lower our average costs on our ounce branded sodas overall by approximately in the year ended december   as compared to the prior year same period  due primarily to lower costs of certain packaging materials 
cost of goods sold idle capacity cost of goods sold idle capacity consists of direct production costs in excess of charges allocated to our finished goods in production 
plant costs include labor costs  production supplies  repairs and maintenance  and inventory write off 
our charges for labor and overhead allocated to our finished goods are determined on a market cost basis  which is lower than our actual costs incurred 
plant costs in excess of production allocations are expensed in the period incurred rather than added to the cost of finished goods produced 
idle capacity expenses increased to  in the year ended december   from  in the prior year 
the increase is due to higher unabsorbed costs of production  primarily in payroll  workers compensation insurance and depreciation expense 
during  we performed a number of plant upgrades and maintenance which required labor costs which could not be capitalized and which required periods of down time from production 
despite the down periods  our copack volume in the los angeles brewery increased by over in  as compared to we also reduced our internal absorption rates on certain products  to reflect market costs  which resulted in higher unabsorbed period costs 
gross profit our gross profit of  in the year ended december  represents of sales  as compared to the same percentage in the improvement in tangible costs of goods sold  as a percentage in sales  is offset by increased cost of goods sold idle capacity as described above 
delivery and handling expenses delivery and handling expenses consist of delivery costs to certain customers and warehouse costs incurred for handling our finished goods after production 
delivery and handling costs increased to  in the year ended december  from  in the increase is due to higher sales volume  increased freight costs on certain customers and increased inventory handling costs 
as a percentage of sales  delivery and handling expenses increased to in the year ended december   as compared to selling and marketing expenses selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of direct charges for staff compensation costs  advertising  sales promotion  marketing and trade shows 
selling and marketing costs increased overall to  in the year ended december  from  in the  increase is primarily due to increased compensation and travel costs of approximately  offset partially by decreases in facilities and trade show related costs 
as a percentage of sales  selling and marketing costs decreased to in the year ended december   as compared to in general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the cost of executive  administrative  and finance personnel  as well as professional fees 
general and administrative expenses during the year ended december  increased to  from  in a legal matter asserted by a former industrial employee resulted in legal costs of  during also  we adjusted an over accrual of recycling fees payable in the amount of  resulting in a one time reduction in costs during the year 
aside from these two one time events  general and administrative expenses decreased by  in  as compared to the prior year 
the decrease is primarily due to decreased professional and consulting costs 
we believe that our existing executive and administrative staffing levels are sufficient to allow for moderate growth without the need to add personnel and related costs for the foreseeable future 
loss from operations loss from operations was  in the year ended december   as compared to a loss of  in the same period of the improvement of  is primarily due to increased sales and margin contribution 
interest expense interest expense increased to  in the year ended december   compared to interest expense of  in the same period of the increase is due to increased borrowing under a loan and security agreement with pmc financial  llc  secured primarily by our inventory and accounts receivable 
the agreement includes both a revolving line of credit and a term loan  allowing increased borrowing as compared to our former line of credit 
modified ebitda the company defines modified ebitda a non gaap measurement as net loss before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  and non cash expense for securities 
other companies may calculate modified ebitda differently 
management believes that the presentation of modified ebitda provides a measure of performance that approximates cash flow before interest expense  and is meaningful to investors 
modified ebitda schedule year ended december  unaudited unaudited net loss modified ebitda adjustments depreciation and amortization interest expense stock option and warrant compensation other stock compensation for services and finance fees total ebitda adjustments modified ebitda income from operations liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had stockholders equity of  and we had working capital of  compared to stockholders equity of  and working capital of  at december  the cash balance was  as of december   as compared to  at december  the increase in our working capital of  was primarily a result of our sale of our equity securities and proceeds from a long term loan  offset by losses from operations  before depreciation and other non cash expenses 
our decrease in cash and cash equivalents to  at december  compared to  at december  was primarily a result of cash used in operating activities  primarily for increases in accounts receivable and inventory prepayments that are related to our overall increases in ongoing revenues 
such cash used in operations was offset primarily by sales of equity securities 
in addition to our cash position on december   we had availability under our line of credit of  on february   we sold  shares of our common stock and  warrants for  we paid  in expenses in connection with the transaction 
the net proceeds are being used for working capital 
we also gained  through the exercise of warrants 
during the year ended december   we invested  in plant improvements 
we are upgrading the facilities as well as adding new equipment to our production line that will increase our flexibility in product offerings and increase our plant performance 
our loan and security agreement with pmc financial services group  llc provides a million revolving line of credit and a  term loan 
the revolving line of credit is based on of eligible accounts receivable and of eligible inventory 
the interest rate on the revolving line of credit is at the prime rate plus at december  
the term loan is for  and bears interest at the prime rate plus  which shall not be below  is secured by all of the unencumbered assets of the company  and is to be repaid in equal installments of principal and interest of  we believe that the company currently has the necessary working capital to support existing operations for at least the next months 
our primary capital source will be cash flow from operations as we gain profitability 
if our sales goals do not materialize as planned  we believe that the company can become leaner and our costs can be managed to produce profitable operations 
historically  we have financed our operations primarily through private sales of common stock  preferred stock  convertible debt  a line of credit from a financial institution and cash generated from operations 
we may not generate sufficient revenues from product sales in the future to achieve profitable operations 
if we are not able to achieve profitable operations at some point in the future  we eventually may have insufficient working capital to maintain our operations as we presently intend to conduct them or to fund our expansion and marketing and product development plans 
in addition  our losses may increase in the future as we expand our manufacturing capabilities and fund our marketing plans and product development 
these losses  among other things  have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our working capital  total assets and stockholders equity 
if we are unable to achieve profitability  the market value of our common stock would decline and there would be a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
if we continue to suffer losses from operations  our working capital may be insufficient to support our ability to expand our business operations as rapidly as we would deem necessary at any time  unless we are able to obtain additional financing 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing on acceptable terms  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we may not be able to pursue our business objectives and would be required to reduce our level of operations  including reducing infrastructure  promotions  personnel and other operating expenses 
these events could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if adequate funds are not available or if they are not available on acceptable terms  our ability to fund the growth of our operations  take advantage of opportunities  develop products or services or otherwise respond to competitive pressures  could be significantly limited 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our financial statements including various allowances and reserves for accounts receivable and inventories  the estimated lives of long lived assets and trademarks and trademark licenses  as well as claims and contingencies arising out of litigation or other transactions that occur in the normal course of business 
the following summarize our most significant accounting and reporting policies and practices revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized on the sale of a product when the product is shipped  which is when the risk of loss transfers to our customers  and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured 
a product is not shipped without an order from the customer and credit acceptance procedures performed 
the allowance for returns is regularly reviewed and adjusted by management based on historical trends of returned items 
amounts paid by customers for shipping and handling costs are included in sales 
the company reimburses its wholesalers and retailers for promotional discounts  samples and certain advertising and promotional activities used in the promotion of the company s products 
the accounting treatment for the reimbursements for samples and discounts to wholesalers results in a reduction in the net revenue line item 
reimbursements to wholesalers and retailers for certain advertising activities are included in selling and marketing expenses 
trademark license and trademarks 
we own trademarks that we consider material to our business 
three of our material trademarks are registered trademarks in the us patent and trademark office virgil s  reed s original ginger brew all natural jamaican style ginger ale and tianfu china natural soda 
registrations for trademarks in the united states will last indefinitely as long as we continue to use and police the trademarks and renew filings with the applicable governmental offices 
we have not been challenged in our right to use any of our material trademarks in the united states 
we intend to obtain international registration of certain trademarks in foreign jurisdictions 
we account for these items in accordance with fasb guidance  we do not amortize indefinite lived trademark licenses and trademarks 
in accordance with fasb guidance  we evaluate our non amortizing trademark license and trademarks quarterly for impairment 
we measure impairment by the amount that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the trademark license and trademarks 
the fair value is calculated by reviewing net sales of the various beverages and applying industry multiples 
based on our quarterly impairment analysis the estimated fair values of trademark license and trademarks exceeded the carrying value and no impairments were identified during the year ended december  long lived assets 
our management regularly reviews property  equipment and other long lived assets  including identifiable amortizing intangibles  for possible impairment 
this review occurs quarterly or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
if there is indication of impairment of property and equipment or amortizable intangible assets  then management prepares an estimate of future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value 
the fair value is estimated at the present value of the future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with management s estimates of the business risks 
quarterly  or earlier  if there is indication of impairment of identified intangible assets not subject to amortization  management compares the estimated fair value with the carrying amount of the asset 
an impairment loss is recognized to write down the intangible asset to its fair value if it is less than the carrying amount 
preparation of estimated expected future cash flows is inherently subjective and is based on management s best estimate of assumptions concerning expected future conditions 
no impairments were identified during the year ended december  management believes that the accounting estimate related to impairment of our long lived assets  including our trademark license and trademarks  is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires management to estimate fair value  which is based on assumptions about cash flows and discount rates  and the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on the assets reported on our balance sheet  as well as net income  could be material 
management s assumptions about cash flows and discount rates require significant judgment because actual revenues and expenses have fluctuated in the past and we expect they will continue to do so 
in estimating future revenues  we use internal budgets 
internal budgets are developed based on recent revenue data for existing product lines and planned timing of future introductions of new products and their impact on our future cash flows 
accounts receivable 
we evaluate the collectability of our trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors 
in circumstances where we become aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount our management believes will ultimately be collected 
in addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts  bad debt charges are recorded based on our historical losses and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable outstanding 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we regularly review our inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and or our ability to sell the product s concerned and production requirements 
demand for our products can fluctuate significantly 
factors that could affect demand for our products include unanticipated changes in consumer preferences  general market conditions or other factors  which may result in cancellations of advance orders or a reduction in the rate of reorders placed by customers 
additionally  our management s estimates of future product demand may be inaccurate  which could result in an understated or overstated provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
stock based compensation 
we periodically issue stock options and warrants to employees and non employees in non capital raising transactions for services and for financing costs 
the company accounts for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to employees based on fasb asc topic  compensation stock compensation  whereas the award is measured at its fair value at the date of grant and is amortized ratably over the vesting period 
we account for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to non employees in accordance with asc topic whereby the fair value of the stock compensation is based on the measurement date as determined at either a the date at which a performance commitment is reached  or b at the date at which the necessary performance to earn the equity instrument is complete 
we estimate the fair value of stock options using the black scholes option pricing model  which was developed for use in estimating the fair value of options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
this model requires the input of subjective assumptions  including the expected price volatility of the underlying stock and the expected life of stock options 
projected data related to the expected volatility of stock options is based on the historical volatility of the trading prices of the company s common stock and the expected life of stock options is based upon the average term and vesting schedules of the options 
changes in these subjective assumptions can materially affect the fair value of the estimate  and therefore the existing valuation models do not provide a precise measure of the fair value of our employee stock options 
we believe there have been no significant changes  during the year ended december   to the items disclosed as critical accounting policies and estimates in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the company s annual report on form k for the year ended december  recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss 
asu no 
does not require additional fair value measurements and is not intended to establish valuation standards or affect valuation practices outside of financial reporting 
the asu is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  the company will adopt the asu as required 
the asu will affect the company s fair value disclosures  but will not affect the company s results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 presentation of comprehensive income 
the asu eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in shareholders equity  and instead requires consecutive presentation of the statement of net income and other comprehensive income either in a continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
asu no 
is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  the company will adopt the asu as required 
it will have no affect on the company s results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
in september  the fasb issued asu  testing goodwill for impairment  an update to existing guidance on the assessment of goodwill impairment 
this update simplifies the assessment of goodwill for impairment by allowing companies to consider qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before performing the two step impairment review process 
it also amends the examples of events or circumstances that would be considered in a goodwill impairment evaluation 
the amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted 
the company is currently evaluating the affects adoption of asu may have on its goodwill impairment testing 
other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the fasb including its emerging issues task force  the aicpa  and the securities exchange commission the sec did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the company s present or future consolidated financial statements 
inflation although management expects that our operations will be influenced by general economic conditions  we do not believe that inflation has a material effect on our results of operations
