changes in tax laws impacting marginal tax rates and or the preferred tax treatment of municipal obligations could adversely impact our business 
tax legislation that changes the tax preference of municipal obligations under current law could adversely affect the market value of municipal obligations 
at december   of our investment portfolio was invested in tax exempt municipal obligations 
as such  the value of our investment portfolio could be adversely affected by any such legislation 
additionally  any such changes in tax law could reduce the difference between tax exempt interest rates and taxable rates  which can subject us to additional tax liability  reducing the overall net investment return of our portfolio 
risks related to our general operations operational risks  including human or systems failures  are inherent in our business 
operational risks and losses can result from  among other things  fraud  errors  failure to document transactions properly or to obtain proper internal authorization  failure to comply with regulatory requirements  information technology failures  or external events 
we believe that our modeling  underwriting  and information technology and application systems are critical to our business 
we expect our information technology and application systems to remain an important part of our underwriting process and our ability to compete successfully 
we have also licensed certain systems and data from third parties 
we cannot be certain that we will have access to these  or comparable  service providers  or that our information technology or application systems will continue to operate as intended 
a major defect or failure in our internal controls or information technology and application systems could i result in management distraction  ii harm our reputation  or iii increase our expenses 
we believe appropriate controls and mitigation procedures are in place to prevent significant risk of defect in our internal controls around our information technology and application systems  but internal controls provide only a reasonable  not absolute  assurance as to the absence of errors or irregularities and any ineffectiveness of such controls and procedures could have a significant and negative effect on our business 
we depend on key personnel 
to a large extent  the success of our businesses is dependent on our ability to attract and retain key employees 
competition to attract and retain key personnel is intense 
while we have employment agreements with certain key managers  all of our employees are at will employees and we cannot ensure that we will be able to attract and retain key personnel 
as of december   our workforce had an average age of approximately and approximately of our workforce was retirement eligible under our retirement and benefit plans 
if we experience difficulties with outsourcing relationships  our ability to conduct our business might be negatively impacted 
we outsource certain business and administrative functions to third parties for efficiencies and cost savings  and may do so increasingly in the future 
if we fail to develop and implement our outsourcing strategies or our third party providers fail to perform as anticipated  we may experience operational difficulties  increased costs  and a loss of business that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
by outsourcing certain business and administrative functions to third parties  we may be exposed to enhanced risk of data security breaches 
any breach of data security could damage our reputation and or result in monetary damages  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity  financial condition  financial strength  and debt ratings 
we are subject to a variety of modeling risks  which could have a material adverse impact on our business results 
we rely on complex financial models  such as predictive modeling  a claims fraud model  third party catastrophe models  an enterprise risk management capital model  and modeling tools used by our investment managers  which have been developed internally or by third parties to analyze historical loss costs and pricing  trends in claims severity and frequency  the occurrence of catastrophe losses  investment performance  and portfolio risk 
flaws in these financial models  or faulty assumptions used by these financial models  could lead to increased losses 
we believe that statistical models alone do not provide a reliable method of monitoring and controlling market risk 
therefore  such models are tools and do not substitute for the experience or judgment of senior management 
we have significant deferred tax assets that we may be unable to use if we do not generate sufficient future taxable income 
we have a net operating loss as of december  and have sufficient carryback capacity to absorb the net operating loss 
we have no capital loss carryforward as of december  in the future  we would be required to establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets if i we do not have net operating loss and or capital loss carryback capacity  ii it is determined that it is more likely than not that sufficient future income of the appropriate character will be generated  and iii there are no valid tax planning strategies to generate taxable income of the appropriate character ie ordinary loss or capital loss 
the establishment of a valuation allowance would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity  financial condition  financial strength  and debt ratings 
risks related to our corporate structure and governance we are a holding company and our ability to declare dividends to our shareholders  pay indebtedness  and enter into affiliate transactions may be limited because our insurance subsidiaries are regulated 
restrictions on the ability of the insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends  make loans or advances to us  or enter into transactions with us may materially affect our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or repay our indebtedness 
our transactions with our insurance subsidiaries and their ability to pay dividends or make loans or advances to us are subject to the approval or review of the insurance regulators in the states where the insurance subsidiaries are organized 
the standards for review of such transactions are whether i the terms and charges are fair and reasonable  and ii after the transaction  the insurance subsidiary s surplus for policyholders is reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and financial needs 
although dividends and loans to us from our insurance subsidiaries historically have been approved  we can make no assurance that future dividends and loans will be approved 
because we are an insurance holding company and a new jersey corporation  potential acquirers may be discouraged and the value of our common stock could be adversely affected 
because we are an insurance holding company that owns insurance subsidiaries  anyone who seeks to acquire or more of our stock must seek prior approval from the insurance regulators in the states in which the subsidiaries are organized and file extensive information regarding their business operations and finances 
because we are organized under new jersey law  provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also may discourage  delay  or prevent us from being acquired  including supermajority voting requirements and fair price to approve business combinations  supermajority voting requirements to amend the foregoing provisions  and the ability of the board to issue blank check preferred stock 
under the new jersey shareholders protection act  we may not engage in specified business combinations with a shareholder having indirect or direct beneficial ownership of or more of the voting power of our outstanding stock an interested shareholder for a period of five years after the date the shareholder became an interested shareholder  unless the business combination is approved by our board before the date they became an interested shareholder 
we may not engage in any business combination with any interested shareholder except i a business combination approved by the board prior to the date they became an interested shareholder  ii a business combination approved by two thirds of our shareholders other than the interested shareholder  or iii a business combination that satisfies certain price criteria 
these provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and new jersey law could have the effect of depriving our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium over our common stock s prevailing market price in the event of a hostile takeover and may adversely affect the value of our common stock

item properties 
our main office is located in branchville  new jersey on a site owned by a subsidiary with approximately acres and  square feet of operational space 
we lease all of our other facilities

of this form k 
we believe our facilities provide adequate space for our present needs and that additional space  if needed  would be available on reasonable terms 
item legal proceedings 
in the ordinary course of conducting business  we are named as defendants in various legal proceedings 
most of these proceedings are claims litigation involving our insurance subsidiaries as either a liability insurers defending or providing indemnity for third party claims brought against insureds  or b insurers defending first party coverage claims brought against them 
we account for such activity through the establishment of unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
we expect that the ultimate liability  if any  with respect to such ordinary course claims litigation  after consideration of provisions made for potential losses and costs of defense  will not be material to our consolidated financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
our insurance subsidiaries are also from time to time involved in other legal actions  some of which assert claims for substantial amounts 
these actions include  among others  putative class actions seeking certification of a state or national class 
such putative class actions have alleged  for example  improper reimbursement of medical providers paid under workers compensation and personal and commercial automobile insurance policies 
our insurance subsidiaries are also involved from time to time in individual actions in which extra contractual damages  punitive damages  or penalties are sought  such as claims alleging bad faith in the handling of insurance claims 
we believe that we have valid defenses to these cases 
we expect that the ultimate liability  if any  with respect to such lawsuits  after consideration of provisions made for estimated losses  will not be material to our consolidated financial condition 
nonetheless  given the large or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these actions  and the inherent unpredictability of litigation  an adverse outcome in certain matters could  from time to time  have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods

such approval and review is made under the respective domiciliary states insurance holding company acts  which generally require that any transaction between related companies be fair and equitable to the insurance company and its policyholders 
although our dividends have historically been met with regulatory approval  there is no assurance that future dividends will be approved given current market conditions
