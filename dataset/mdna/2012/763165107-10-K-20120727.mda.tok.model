goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill goodwill is initially recorded based on the premium paid for acquisitions and is subsequently tested for impairment 
we test goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances indicates an impairment may have occurred  such as a significant adverse change in the business climate  loss of key personnel or a decision to sell or dispose of a reporting unit 
as of the fiscal year ended june   our goodwill balance was million and represents the premium we paid for powerlink during our second quarter of fiscal during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  our goodwill balances are reviewed for impairment using the last day of our third quarter as the measurement date 
in accordance with asc intangibles goodwill and other  if indicators of impairment are deemed to be present  we would perform an interim impairment test and any resulting impairment loss would be charged to expense in the period identified 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we adopted accounting standards update asu which allows for the option to make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of goodwill impairment to determine whether it should calculate the fair value of an operating segment 
we applied this qualitative approach to our edg operating segment and concluded that indications of impairment were not present as of june  the qualitative factors considered included macroeconomic conditions  industry and market considerations  cost factors  overall financial performance  and other relevant entity or reporting unit specific events 

table of contents intangible assets intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair market values determined on quoted market prices in active markets  if available  or recognized valuation models 
intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives 
our intangible asset is the fair value that we determined for customer relationships acquired in connection with the acquisition of powerlink during the second quarter of our fiscal year the fair value was based upon discounted cash flows that the customer relationships are expected to generate over the next twenty years 
gain loss on disposal of assets loss on disposal of assets from continuing operations was million during fiscal other income expense other income expense was income of million during fiscal  compared with expense of million during fiscal the change from expense to income during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was due primarily to income from investments of million 
foreign exchange was a gain of less than million during fiscal  as compared to a foreign exchange loss of million during fiscal our foreign exchange gains and losses are primarily due to the translation of us currency we have in us bank accounts

income tax provision benefit our income tax benefit during fiscal year was million 
our income tax provision for fiscal year was million 
during fiscal  we had an income tax benefit of million 

table of contents the effective income tax rates for continuing operations during fiscal   and  were   and  respectively 
the difference between the effective tax rates as compared to the us federal statutory rate of during and during fiscal and  resulted from our geographical distribution of taxable income or losses  return to provision adjustments  the release of income tax reserves  and a change in the amount of foreign earnings considered to be permanently reinvested in foreign countries 
there were no changes in judgment during the fiscal year end regarding the beginning of year valuation allowance which would require a benefit to be excluded from the annual effective tax rate and allocated to the interim period 
as of june   we had no domestic federal net operating loss nol carryforwards as all nol carryforwards were fully utilized in the prior year 
domestic state nol carryforwards amounted to approximately million primarily related to states where the utilization of nols have been suspended for the next two taxable years 
foreign nol carryforwards totaled approximately million with various or indefinite expiration dates 
we also had no alternative minimum tax credit carryforward or foreign tax credit carryforwards as of june   as these attributes were also fully utilized in the prior year 
based on this  our future us federal statutory tax rate is expected to be closer to  our state effective tax rate is expected to be approximately  and our foreign effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 
income taxes paid  including foreign estimated tax payments  were million  million  and million during fiscal   and  respectively 
as of june   million of cumulative positive earnings of some of our foreign subsidiaries are still considered permanently reinvested pursuant to asc  income taxes other considerations or special areas asc 
due to various tax attributes that are continuously changing  it is not practical to determine what  if any  tax liability might exist if such earnings were to be repatriated 
in the normal course of business  we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world 
we are no longer subject to either us federal  state or local  or us tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to fiscal currently  we are under federal audit in the us for fiscal years and the irs has also verbally notified the company that the fiscal year tax return will be audited 
our primary foreign tax jurisdictions are china  japan  germany  singapore  and the netherlands 
we have tax years open in germany beginning in fiscal  in japan and the netherlands beginning in fiscal  in singapore beginning in fiscal  and in china beginning in calendar year discontinued operations arrow transaction on march   we completed the sale of the assets primarily used or held for use in  and certain liabilities of  our rfpd division  as well as certain other company assets  including our information technology assets  to arrow in exchange for million  which included an estimated pre closing working capital adjustment of approximately million 
the final purchase price was subject to a post closing working capital adjustment 
on june   we received notification from arrow seeking a post closing working capital adjustment  which would reduce the purchase price by approximately million 
we recorded the working capital adjustment of million in our results from discontinued operations during our fourth quarter of fiscal during the first quarter of fiscal  we agreed to approximately million of the proposed working capital adjustment and adjusted our results from discontinued operations during the first quarter of fiscal during the second quarter of fiscal  we paid arrow million to settle the agreed upon working capital adjustment 
following the transaction  the compensation committee of our board of directors granted cash bonus compensation to certain executive officers and former employees in recognition of their efforts for successfully completing the transaction 
the cash bonus compensation amount awarded was approximately million  and was recorded as expense from discontinued operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal 
table of contents to help facilitate the transition of rfpd to arrow  we agreed to provide certain transitional services to arrow such as financial support services  warehouse services  and access to facilities in accordance with the terms of the transition services agreement 
arrow also agreed to provide certain transitional services such as information technology services  warehouse services  and access to facilities and equipment in accordance with the terms of the transition services agreement 
the duration of the transitional services were less than one year from march   except for the information technology services which is three years 
in addition  we entered into a manufacturing agreement with arrow  in connection with the transaction  for a term of three years 
pursuant to the manufacturing agreement  we agreed to manufacture certain products for arrow 
the transition services agreement  which commenced on march   and ended on march   allowed us to exert very limited influence over arrow s operating and financial policies 
the continuing cash flows related to our transition services agreement as well as the manufacturing agreement  are insignificant 
we believe it is appropriate to include fees and associated costs with the transition services agreement that relate to financial support  certain facilities  and certain warehouse services in discontinued operations as they relate specifically to rfpd 
we further believe it is appropriate to treat the revenue and costs associated with the manufacturing agreement as discontinued operations as it relates specifically to rfpd 
honeywell transaction on may   we completed the sale of the security systems division burtek systems ssd burtek to honeywell international inc honeywell

we believe that existing sources of liquidity  including current cash  will provide sufficient resources to meet known capital requirements and working capital needs for the fiscal year ending june  critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management continuously evaluates its critical accounting policies and estimates  including the allowance for doubtful accounts  revenue recognition  inventory obsolescence  loss contingencies  and income taxes 
management bases the estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  however  actual results could differ from those estimates 
the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to understanding our financial position and results of operations 
their application involves significant judgments and estimates in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for all of these policies  management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts our allowance for doubtful accounts includes estimated losses that result from uncollectible receivables 
the estimates are influenced by the following continuing credit evaluation of customers financial conditions  aging of receivables  individually and in the aggregate  a large number of customers which are widely dispersed across geographic areas  collectability and delinquency history by geographic area  and the fact that no single customer accounts for more than of net sales 
significant changes in one or more of these considerations may require adjustments affecting net income and net carrying value of accounts receivable 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately million and million as of june   and may   respectively 
revenue recognition our product sales are recognized as revenue upon shipment  when title passes to the customer  when delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  and when collectability is reasonably assured 
we also record estimated discounts and returns based on our historical experience 
our products are often manufactured to meet the specific design needs of our customers applications 
our engineers work closely with customers to ensure that our products will meet their needs 
our customers are under no obligation to compensate us for designing the products we sell 
in a limited number of cases  we provide and bill our customers with non product related services  such as testing  calibration  non recurring engineering  tooling  and installation services 
we have concluded that the service revenue should not be considered a separate unit of accounting from the product sale as we have determined there is no objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
we have also concluded that  in the limited cases where remaining obligations exist after delivery of the product  the obligation relative to the unit of accounting is inconsequential or perfunctory 
this conclusion was reached based on the following facts the timing of any remaining obligation is agreed upon with the customer  which in most cases  is performed immediately after the delivery of the product  the cost and time involved to complete the remaining obligation is minimal  and the costs and time do not vary significantly  we have a demonstrated history of completing the remaining obligations timely  and finally  failure to complete the remaining obligation does not enable the customer to receive a full or partial refund of the product or the service 
inventories our worldwide inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  generally using a weighted average cost method 
our inventories included million of finished goods and million of raw materials and work in progress 
provisions for obsolete or slow moving inventories are recorded based upon regular analysis of stock rotation privileges  obsolescence  the exiting of certain market segments  and assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if future demand  changes in the industry  or market conditions differ from management s estimates  additional provisions may be necessary 
we recorded provisions to our inventory reserves of million  million  and million during fiscal   and  respectively  which were included in cost of sales 
the provisions were principally for obsolete and slow moving parts 
the parts were written down to estimated realizable value 

table of contents loss contingencies we accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
when only a range of possible loss can be established  the most probable amount in the range is accrued 
if no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range  the minimum amount in the range is accrued 
if we determine that there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred  we will include a disclosure describing the contingency 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and determine the need for a valuation allowance based on a number of factors  including both positive and negative evidence 
these factors include historical taxable income or loss  projected future taxable income or loss  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences  and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
in circumstances where we  or any of our affiliates  have incurred three years of cumulative losses which constitute significant negative evidence  positive evidence of equal or greater significance is needed to overcome the negative evidence before a tax benefit is recognized for deductible temporary differences and loss carryforwards

the amendments to the codification in the asu do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income 
asu update no 
should be applied retrospectively 
for public entities  the amendments are effective for fiscal years  and interim period within those years  beginning after december   and as such  we adopted asc update no 
during our third quarter of fiscal 
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management and market sensitive financial instruments we are exposed to various market risks 
the primary financial risks include foreign currency exchange risks  as certain operations  assets  and liabilities of ours are denominated in foreign currencies 
we manage these risks through normal operating activities
