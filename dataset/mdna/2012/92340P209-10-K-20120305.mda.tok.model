we operate in one business segment with five main product lines animal health and nutrition  grain processing  oilseed processing  oilfield services and other industrial processes 
we believe the most significant near term commercial opportunity for our business will be derived from continued sales and gross product margins from our existing portfolio of enzyme products 
our business is supported by a research and development team with expertise in gene discovery and optimization  cell engineering  bioprocess development  biochemistry and microbiology 
over nearly years  our research and development team has developed a proprietary technology platform that has enabled us to apply advancements in science to discovering and developing unique solutions in complex industrial or commercial applications 
we have dedicated substantial resources to the development of capabilities for sample collection from the world s microbial populations  generation of dna libraries  screening of these libraries using ultra high throughput methods capable of analyzing more than one billion genes per day  and optimization based on our gene evolution technologies 
we have continued to shift more of our resources from technology development to commercialization efforts for our existing and future technologies and products 
while our technologies have the potential to serve many large markets  our primary areas of focus for product development are specialty enzymes for animal health and nutrition  grain processing  oilseed processing  oilfield services  and other industrial enzyme markets 
we have current collaborations and agreements with key partners such as bunge oils  novus international  inc  or novus  alfa laval  desmet ballestra  danisco animal nutrition  or danisco  which was acquired in by e 
i 
du pont de nemours and company  or dupont  fermic sa  or fermic  and weissbiotech formerly add food services gmbh  each of which complement our internal technology  product development efforts  and distribution efforts 
as of december   we owned issued patents relating to our technologies and had patents pending 
also  as of december   we either jointly owned or in licensed from bp patents and patents pending 
our rights to sell our products and products in development are largely covered by the patents and patent applications we own  and to a lesser extent by patents and patent applications we jointly own with bp 
our rights to practice the discovery and evolution technology which we originally developed are covered by patents we in license from bp 
we believe that we can leverage our owned and licensed intellectual property estate to enhance and improve our technology development and commercialization efforts while maintaining protection on key intellectual property assets 
excluding our non cash gains related to our debt repurchases in  we have typically incurred net losses from our continuing operations since our inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
our results of operations have fluctuated from period to period and likely will continue to fluctuate substantially in the future 
during the year ended december   we generated an operating loss of million 
we expect to incur losses in the near term  as a result of any combination of one or more of the following continued research and development expenses for the progression of internal product candidates  
table of contents our continued investment in manufacturing facilities and or capabilities necessary to meet anticipated demand for our products or improve manufacturing yields  and maintaining or increasing our sales and marketing infrastructure 
results of operations for any period may be unrelated to results of operations for any other period 
in addition  we believe that our historical results are not a good indicator of our future operating results 
the holders of the notes have the right to require us to purchase the notes for cash including any accrued and unpaid interest on april  we expect the holders of our notes to exercise this right  and based on our current cash resources and operating plan  our existing cash resources will not be sufficient to meet the cash requirements to fund our planned operating expenses  capital expenditures and working capital requirements without additional sources of cash 
if we are unable to fund the repurchase of the notes when required or otherwise raise additional capital  we will need to defer  reduce or eliminate significant planned expenditures  restructure or significantly curtail our operations  sell some or all our assets  file for bankruptcy or cease operations 
to the extent we restructure rather than repurchase all or any portion of the notes  we may issue common shares or other convertible debt for the notes that are restructured  which would result in substantial dilution to our equityholders 
recent developments bp arbitration as more fully described in the section of this report entitled liquidity and capital resources beginning on page  on february   we filed for arbitration regarding immediate distribution of million of the amount in escrow  which is included in current restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  financing update on march   we announced that we are considering two primary alternatives to address our capital requirements  including our repurchase requirements for our notes 
we are exploring issuing new equity linked or equity securities  and may explore converting our notes into equity along with a partial repayment thereof  or a combination of the foregoing 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to effect any such transaction 
we have also received non binding offers from more than one prospective purchaser to acquire percent of our stock  and we are actively evaluating options for a potential sale of our company 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate and enter into definitive agreements related to a sale of our company 
results of operations continuing operations consolidated results of operations revenues revenues for the years ended december  and are as follows in thousands change revenues animal health and nutrition grain processing oilseed processing all other products total product collaborative and license total revenues 
table of contents product revenues increased  or million  primarily due to increased market share of our fuelzyme alpha amylase enzyme in the fuel ethanol market  as well as increased market penetration of our purifine plc plc enzyme for soybean oil processing 
while our grain processing sales have increased by over as we continue to increase our market share  current industry conditions can significantly impact our revenue for this product line 
for example us ethanol production and inventories increased at the end of the volumetric ethanol excise tax credit veetc  which has indirectly subsidized the ethanol industry through  expired on january  in  the us ethanol industry exported a record billion gallons of ethanol  largely to brazil  europe and canada  but as the dollar strengthens and countries work to increase domestic ethanol production  this opportunity may decline 
these factors combined with seasonally lower demand for gasoline  and the impact of rising gasoline prices on consumer demand  suggest the industry may be entering a challenging cycle with conditions conducive to production rate cuts and plant closures which could negatively impact our business 
while our purifine plc sales have increased by more than over  the growth and profitability of purifine plc are subject to various risks  including  but not limited to  the following the price of soybean oil could drop significantly  and the value of the oil yield gained by using the purifine plc enzymatic degumming process may be diminished and customers may choose to not run the process 
our current business is heavily concentrated in argentina  thus  we are exposed to the seasonality of the soybean industry  as well draughts  floods  work stoppages  and changes to government tax policies which can adversely impact the demand for our product 
delays in engineering  construction and startup of retrofits of existing plants  or delays in startup of new plants where purifine plc enzymatic degumming is incorporated in the design  can impact the timing of forecast sales 
net revenues from the animal health and nutrition product line  primarily phyzyme xp phytase  increased  or million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  phyzyme xp represented approximately of total product revenues for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  although we expect that phyzyme xp phytase will continue to represent a significant percentage of our total product revenues in the foreseeable future  we expect that net revenue from phyzyme xp phytase will remain flat or gradually decrease in future periods 
this is largely due to two factors 
a decrease in royalty from danisco based on market conditions  such as declining consumption of poultry or pork resulting in reduced demand or increased competition resulting in reduced pricing  and a shift in manufacturing of phzyme xp phytase to genencor  a division of danisco holding usa  inc which is part of ei du pont de nemours and company  and our related method of revenue recognition for phyzyme xp phytase product sales 
we also have contracted with genencor to serve as a second source manufacturer of phyzyme xp phytase 
we recognize revenue from phyzyme xp phytase manufactured at fermic equal to the full value of the manufacturing costs plus royalties  as compared to revenue associated with product manufactured by genencor which is recognized on a net basis equal to the royalty received from danisco 
while this revenue recognition treatment has little or no negative impact on the gross margin in absolute dollars we recognize for every sale of phyzyme xp phytase  it does have a negative impact on the gross product revenue we recognize for phyzyme xp phytase as the volume of phyzyme xp phytase manufactured by genencor increases 

table of contents we expect over time we will transition a greater proportion of our phyzyme xp phytase manufacturing to genencor resulting in lower reported phyzyme xp phytase product revenue  however  we believe this will make available existing capacity to accommodate expected growth for our other enzyme products  which we expect will generate higher gross margins than phyzyme xp phytase over time 
collaborative and license revenue increased  or million  primarily due to a license fee of million we received for a commercial enzyme candidate that syngenta participations ag formally licensed to a third party and assigned to us in conjunction with the separation agreement with syngenta in in addition  on june   we entered into a collaboration agreement with novus to develop  manufacture and commercialize a suite of new enzyme products from our late stage product pipeline in the animal health and nutrition product line 
we expect to have increased collaboration revenue continuing into attributable to this new collaboration 
we continue to pursue opportunities to expand  renew  or enter into new collaborations that we believe fit our strategic focus and represent product commercialization opportunities in the future  however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in renewing or expanding existing collaborations  or securing new collaboration partners 
our revenues have historically fluctuated from period to period and likely will continue to fluctuate in the future based upon the adoption rates of our new and existing commercial products  timing and composition of funding under existing and future collaboration agreements  as well as regulatory approval timelines for new products 
in addition  due to authoritative accounting guidance  cash may be received in advance of revenue recognition 
product gross profit margin product gross profit and margin for the years ended december  and are as follows in thousands change product revenue cost of product revenue product gross profit product gross margin cost of product revenue includes both fixed and variable costs  including materials and supplies  labor  facilities  royalties and other overhead costs  associated with our product revenues 
excluded from cost of product revenue are costs associated with the scale up of manufacturing processes for new products that have not reached commercial scale production volumes  which we include in our research and development expenses 
cost of product revenue increased  or million  primarily due to higher product revenue as well as higher rental expense for incremental fermentation capacity to support the expansion of product mix combined with variable costs associated with higher product revenues 
our cost of product revenues will generally grow in proportion to revenues  although we expect to achieve benefits from the additional investments we are making at fermic to improve our enzyme manufacturing capabilities 
because a large percentage of total manufacturing costs are fixed  we should realize margin improvements as product revenues increase  however  margins could be negatively impacted in the future if product revenues do not grow in line with our committed fermentation capacity at fermic 
we further expanded our fermentation capacity during the third quarter of  which increased fixed manufacturing costs by an additional million per quarter  including all four quarters of the year ended december  in addition  gross margins are dependent upon the mix of product sales as the cost of product revenue varies from product to product 
we typically experience lower margins in the early stages of commercial production for our newer enzyme products  as we optimize the manufacturing process for each particular product 

table of contents product gross profit totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  gross margin increased to of product revenue for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  gross profit and margin increased for the year ended december  primarily due to an overall growth and improvement from our non phyzyme xp phytase products 
in addition  because phyzyme xp phytase represents a significant percentage of our product revenue  our product gross profit is impacted to a great degree by the gross profit achieved on sales of phyzyme xp phytase 
under our manufacturing and sales agreement with danisco  we sell our phyzyme xp phytase inventory to danisco at our cost and  under a license agreement  receive a royalty equal to of danisco s profit from the sale of the product  as defined  when the product is sold to danisco s customer 
as a result  our total cost of product revenue for phyzyme xp phytase is incurred as we ship product to danisco  and the royalty calculated as a share of profits  as defined by our agreement  is recognized in the period in which the product is sold to danisco s customer as reported to us by danisco 
we may record our quarterly royalty based on estimates from danisco  and the final calculation of profit share is sometimes finalized in the subsequent quarter  accordingly  we are subject to potential adjustments to our actual royalty from quarter to quarter 
these adjustments  while typically considered immaterial in absolute dollars  could have a significant impact on our reported product gross profit from quarter to quarter 
in addition  our supply agreement with danisco for phyzyme xp phytase contains provisions which allow danisco  with six months advance notice  to assume manufacturing rights for phyzyme xp phytase 
if danisco decides to exercise this right  we would also have the right to reduce our capacity commitment to fermic  nevertheless we may still experience significant excess capacity at fermic as a result 
if we are unable to absorb this excess capacity with other products in the event that danisco assumes all or a portion of phyzyme xp phytase manufacturing rights  this may have a negative impact on our revenues and our product gross profit 
operating expenses excluding cost of product revenue operating expenses excluding cost of product revenue for the years ended december  and were as follows in thousands change research and development selling  general and administrative expenses restructuring charges total operating expenses excluding cost of product revenue operating expenses excluding cost of product revenue for the year ended december  decreased  or million  to million including restructuring expense of million and share based compensation of million compared to million including share based compensation of million for the year ended december  excluding the impact of share based compensation and restructuring expense  total operating expenses decreased  or million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in  primarily due to a reimbursement of legal fees of million for expenses incurred during  reduction of facilities related costs as a result of bp assuming our san diego building leases  and to an increase in expense in due to the payment and expensing of bonus payments of million 
additionally  costs have decreased due to initiatives to decrease general and administrative expenses 
as a partial offset  research and development costs for continued investment in pipeline products have increased 

table of contents research and development our research and development expenses for the years ended december  and were as follows in thousands change research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with internal development of our technologies and our product candidates  manufacturing scale up and bioprocess development for our current products  and costs associated with research activities performed on behalf of our collaborators 
our research and development expenses increased  or million  primarily due to our increased research and development efforts consistent with our shift in focus to higher investment in pipeline technologies 
due to limited capital resources  challenging economic conditions  and a focus on cellulosic biofuels technology development prior to the sale of our ligno cellulosic business  or lc business  during the three years preceding the sale of our lc business we did not spend significant resources on early stage product development 
beginning in the fourth quarter  we began making additional investment for the development and commercialization of candidates in our enzyme product pipeline 
we expect these expenses to increase in as we further advance enzyme product candidates through the development pipeline and commercialization efforts 
for the year ended december   of total research and development expense was attributed to new product development and was related to our existing commercial products 
for the year ended december   we estimate that approximately of our research and development personnel costs  based upon hours incurred  were incurred for internally funded product development  and the remaining approximately of such costs were incurred on research activities funded in whole or in part by our partners 
for the year ended december   we estimate that approximately of our research and development personnel costs  based upon hours incurred  were spent on unfunded product development  and that approximately were spent on research activities funded in whole or in part by our partners 
we will continue to pursue opportunities with strategic partners who can share our development costs and accelerate commercialization of  as well as enable us to expand commercial reach for  our pipeline products 
we determine which products and technologies to pursue independently based on various criteria  including market opportunity  investment required  estimated time to market  regulatory hurdles  infrastructure requirements  and industry specific expertise necessary for successful commercialization 
successful products and technologies require significant development and investment prior to regulatory approval and commercialization 
as a result of the significant risks and uncertainties involved in developing and commercializing such products  we are unable to estimate the nature  timing  and cost of the efforts necessary to complete each of our major projects 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the following our products and technologies may require more resources than we anticipate if we are technically unsuccessful in initial development or commercialization efforts  the outcome of research is unknown until each stage of testing is completed  up through and including trials and regulatory approvals  if needed  it can take many years from the initial decision to perform research through development until products and technologies  if any  are ultimately marketed  we have product candidates and technologies in various stages of development related to collaborations as well as internally developed products and technologies 
at any time  we may modify our strategy and pursue additional collaborations for the development and commercialization of some products and technologies that we had intended to pursue independently  and 
table of contents funding for existing products or projects may not be available on commercially acceptable terms  or at all  which may cause us to defer or reduce our product development efforts 
any one of these risks and uncertainties could have a significant impact on the nature  timing  and costs to complete our product and technology development efforts 
accordingly  we are unable to predict which potential commercialization candidates we may proceed with  the time and costs to complete development  and ultimately whether we will have any products or technologies approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies 
the various risks associated with our research and development activities are discussed more fully in the section of this report entitled risk factors beginning on page selling  general and administrative expenses our selling  general and administrative expenses for the years ended december  and were as follows in thousands 
change selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased  or million  to million including share based compensation of million for the year ended december   as compared to million including share based compensation of million for the year ended december  excluding the impact of share based compensation  selling  general and administrative decreased  or million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in the decrease for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is attributable to a reimbursement of legal fees of million received in for expenses incurred during  reduction of facilities related costs as a result of bp assuming our san diego building leases  and an increase in expense as we paid and expensed bonus payments of million 
additionally  the decrease is attributed to company initiatives to decrease overall general and administrative expenses 
restructuring charges effective march   we closed our office in cambridge to better align us with the evolving needs of the business and the market 
as the cease use date was established on this date  a liability of million was established for the facility  net of deferred rent write off  as well as million in fixed asset write off as of march  further  personnel termination costs of million were incurred in conjunction with the closure of the office  as well as million in relocation costs for certain employees who relocated to the san diego facility as a result of the closure 
in addition to these costs  million in stock compensation costs were recognized as part of restructuring costs  which were incurred for option accelerations for two executives who terminated their employment with us  as provided in their respective employment agreements 
as of december   a liability of million remained for the restructuring  for which payments are expected to be substantially completed in early 
table of contents share based compensation charges we recognized million and million in share based compensation expense for our share based awards in continuing operations during the years ended december  and share based compensation expense was allocated among the following expense categories in thousands research and development selling  general and administrative restructuring charges share based compensation increased  or million  primarily related an acceleration of options during the first quarter resulting in restructuring expense incurred due to the separation of two executives in conjunction with the closure of the cambridge office  partially offset by a decrease in the amount of option grants 
pursuant to their employment agreements  an additional months of option vesting was accelerated for these employees as of their respective separation dates 
this additional stock option expense attributable to the acceleration was classified into restructuring expense on our consolidated financial statements 
this increase was offset by a decrease in the amount of option grants during interest expense interest expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease in interest expense from was primarily attributed to the decrease in the outstanding convertible notes principal from repurchases 
total interest expense for the years ended december  and was comprised of the following in thousands coupon interest  payable in cash non cash amortization of debt issuance costs notes total coupon interest  paid in cash non cash accretion of debt discount non cash amortization of debt issuance costs notes total coupon interest  payable in cash or common stock non cash amortization of debt premium notes total other total interest expense 
table of contents gain loss on debt extinguishment upon repurchase of convertible notes during the year ended december   we repurchased million in principal amount of our notes and notes  leaving no notes outstanding and an aggregate of million in principal amount of notes outstanding as of december  a gain on debt extinguishment of million was recognized representing the difference between the carrying value of the notes repurchased of million for the year ended december  and the principal repurchase price of million calculated as follows in thousands notes notes total principal debt premium  net compound embedded derivative issuance costs carrying value principal repurchase price gain on debt extinguishment on september   we repurchased million in principal amount of our and notes for a total of million in cash  excluding accrued interest as of the closing date 
the repurchase qualified for debt extinguishment accounting resulting in a loss of approximately million for the year ended december  representing the difference between the principal repurchase price of million and carrying value of million calculated as follows in thousands notes notes total principal debt discount compound embedded derivative issuance costs carrying value principal repurchase price gain loss on debt extinguishment gain loss on net change in fair value of derivative assets and liabilities the fair value of the notes compound embedded derivative  the warrants issued in connection with the issuance of the notes  the convertible hedge transaction in connection with our notes and the notes compound embedded derivative were recorded as a derivative asset or liability and marked to market at each balance sheet date 
the change in fair value was recorded in the consolidated statement of operations as gain loss on net change in fair value of derivative assets and liabilities 
we recorded a net loss of million and million for the years ended december  and related to the change in fair value of our recorded derivative asset and liabilities 
gain on debt extinguishment upon conversion of convertible debt during the year ended december   we recorded no gain or loss on debt extinguishment as a result of conversions 
during the year ended december   we recorded a gain on debt extinguishment as a result of conversions of million 
the gain is calculated as the difference between the carrying value of the converted notes and the fair value of the shares of common stock delivered to the noteholders upon conversion 
the 
table of contents carrying value of the converted notes for the year ended december  was equal to the million of principal less the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs  which totaled million  as of the conversion date 
during the year ended december   we issued a total of million shares with a total market value as of the dates of conversion of million to settle the converted notes and make whole payments 
net income loss from discontinued operations on september   we completed the sale of the lc business to bp for net proceeds to us of million including million of the purchase price placed in escrow 
as such  the current and prior periods presented in this report have been reclassified to reflect the legacy lc business as discontinued operations 
revenue and expenses allocated to discontinued operations for the years ended december  and were limited to revenue and expenses that were directly related to the operations of the lc business  or that were eliminated as a result of the sale of the lc business 
net income from discontinued operations for the year ended december  was attributed primarily to net present value adjustments of future rent obligations related to a portion of the cambridge office space attributed to the lc business 
loss attributed to noncontrolling interest in consolidated entities discontinued operations for the year ended december  we were considered the primary beneficiary of galaxy biofuels llc galaxy and consolidated its financial results 
as a result  bp s share of losses in galaxy are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations as loss attributed to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities 
upon the completion of the sale of the lc business  bp became the sole investor in galaxy 
as a result  all results for galaxy are reflected separately as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements 
income tax benefit for the year ended december   an income tax benefit from continuing operations reflects recognition of million of federal refundable research credits 
the housing and economic recovery act of  enacted on july   and extended through by the american recovery and reinvestment act of  provided for the acceleration of a portion of unused pre research credits and alternative minimum tax credits in lieu of claiming the bonus depreciation allowance enacted in the economic stimulus act of for the year ended december   authoritative accounting guidance requires total income tax expense or benefit to be allocated among continuing operations  discontinued operations  extraordinary items  other comprehensive income and items charged directly to stockholders equity 
this allocation is referred to as intra period tax allocation 
as a result of net book income from discontinued operations  we recorded an income tax expense of million during the year ended december  an income tax benefit from continuing operations of million was recorded during december   resulting in overall annual income tax expense to zero

table of contents revenues increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  for the year ended december   our revenue mix continued to shift to a larger percentage of product revenues as opposed to collaborative revenues  consistent with our strategy to grow product sales 
product revenues represented of total revenues for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  product revenues increased  or million  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended this increase was primarily due to an increase in revenues from fuelzyme alpha amylase and our newer enzyme products in our grain processing product line  which continued to gain acceptance in the grain ethanol markets 
in addition  our purifine plc enzyme for the soybean oil processing market achieved significant revenue growth over  resulting from purifine plc deployment by molinos in argentina under the supply agreement we announced in march  as well as our bunge agreements 
net revenues from the animal health and nutrition product line  primarily phyzyme xp phytase  decreased million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in  and represented approximately of total product revenues for the year ended december  and for the comparable period in during we saw indications of recovery from the worldwide recession  which we believe positively impacted our revenues 
in particular during  we and our partner danisco  saw a softening in the phytase animal feed market attributed to a recessionary decline in consumer consumption of protein and financial distress in the poultry industry  which negatively impacted demand for feed and thus our enzyme  particularly during the first half of nevertheless  phyzyme xp phytase sales recovered in  as demand for poultry began to recover with improved economic conditions 
demand for fuelzyme alpha amylase was significantly impacted by challenges in the corn ethanol industry during  which experienced distress due to high corn prices and low ethanol prices 
during the first half of  there were several well publicized bankruptcies  including two of the largest producers of corn ethanol in the us operating rates in the industry were significantly reduced  which negatively impacted demand for enzymes in the first half of during  we saw ethanol plant operating rates return to pre levels  and some idle capacity was brought back on line 
latin america  a primary market for purifine plc  used for soybean oil processing  suffered drought  political upheaval over taxes on agricultural exports  and overall challenging market conditions during the initial launch of purifine plc 
as a result  adoption of purifine plc in the region was delayed  thus purifine plc revenue was below expectations for during  however  we began to see strong commercial traction for purifine plc 
collaborative revenue decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december   due in large part to a decrease in revenue related to wind down of projects with existing strategic collaborators

cost of product revenue increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  the increases in cost of product revenue from the comparable periods in the prior year is primarily due to higher rental expense for incremental fermentation capacity to support the expansion of product mix and increase in product revenues 
we expanded our fermentation capacity in fermic during the third quarter of  which increased fixed manufacturing costs by an additional million per quarter 
in addition  gross margins are dependent upon the mix of product sales as the cost of product revenue varies from product to product 
we typically experience lower margins in the early stages of commercial production for our newer enzyme products like purifine plc  as we optimize the manufacturing process for each particular product

table of contents interest and other expense  net interest expense was million and million for the years ended december  and the decrease in interest expense from to was primarily attributed to the decrease in the outstanding principal from conversions  exchanges  and repurchases 
total interest expense for the years ended december  and was comprised of the following in thousands coupon interest  payable in cash non cash amortization of debt issuance costs notes total coupon interest  payable in cash or common stock non cash accretion of debt discount non cash amortization of debt issuance costs notes total coupon interest  payable in cash or common stock non cash amortization of debt premium notes total equipment financing other capitalized interest total interest expense on october   we entered into an agreement with syngenta in connection with the completion of previously defined programs under our joint research collaboration 
as of the separation date  approximately million in deferred revenue was outstanding related to syngenta for unearned  prepaid research funding under the previous agreement 
the million was recognized as gain on contract settlement for the year ended december   as the amount represented cash received in excess of research labor hours incurred  for which we had not completed the revenue earning process 
gain on amendment of notes in connection with the amendment of the notes in september  the notes conversion price was reduced from to and the anti dilution protection included in the notes was changed from full ratchet anti dilution protection to  in most cases  a version of broad based weighted average anti dilution protection  subject to certain limitations 
pursuant to authoritative guidance  we determined that the amendment qualified as a liability extinguishment  and recorded a gain on the amendment of million  equal to the difference between the fair value of the notes compound embedded derivative before and after the amendment 
gain on debt extinguishment upon conversion of convertible debt for the years ended december  and  we recorded a gain on conversion of million and million  calculated as the difference between the carrying value of the converted notes and the fair value of the shares of common stock delivered to the noteholders upon conversion 
the carrying value of the converted notes during the year ended december  was equal to the million of principal less the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs  which totaled million  as of the conversion date 
during the year ended december   we issued a total of million shares with a total market value as of the dates of conversion of million to settle the notes that were converted and related make whole 
table of contents payments 
the carrying value of the converted notes during the year ended december  was equal to million of principal less the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs  which totaled million  as of the conversion date 
during the year ended december   we issued a total of million shares with a total market value as of the dates of conversion of million to settle the notes and make whole payments 
loss on debt extinguishment upon repurchase of convertible notes on september   we repurchased million in principal amount of our and notes for a total of million in cash  excluding accrued interest as of the closing date 
the repurchase allowed us to simplify our capital structure as well as avoid any potential further dilution through conversions 
the repurchase qualified for debt extinguishment accounting resulting in a loss of approximately million for the year ended december  representing the difference between the purchase price of million and carrying value of million calculated as follows in thousands notes notes total principal debt discount compound embedded derivative issuance costs carrying value repurchase price gain loss on debt extinguishment gain loss on net change in fair value of derivative assets and liabilities the fair value of the notes compound embedded derivative  the warrants  the convertible hedge transaction in connection with our notes and notes compound embedded derivative are recorded as a derivative asset or liability and marked to market at each balance sheet date 
the change in fair value is recorded in the consolidated statement of operations as gain loss on net change in fair value of derivative assets and liabilities 
we recorded a net loss of million and a net gain of million for the years ended december  and related to the change in fair value of our recorded derivative asset and liabilities 
net income loss from discontinued operations as previously noted  on september   we completed the sale of the lc business to bp for a purchase price of million 
the transaction resulted in net cash proceeds to us of million including million of the purchase price placed in escrow 
as such  the legacy lc business current and prior periods presented in this report have been reclassified to reflect the legacy lc business as discontinued operations 
for the year ended december   net income from discontinued operations was million and included a million gain on sale of the lc business  net of tax provision of million 
for the year ended december   net loss from discontinued operations was million 
income tax benefit authoritative accounting guidance requires total income tax expense or benefit to be allocated among continuing operations  discontinued operations  extraordinary items  other comprehensive income and items charged directly to stockholders equity 
this allocation is referred to as intra period tax allocation 
as a result of net book income from discontinued operations  we recorded an income tax expense of million during the 
table of contents year ended december  an income tax benefit from continuing operations of million was recorded during december   resulting in overall annual income tax expense to zero 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our business primarily through the sale of common and preferred stock  funding from strategic partners and government grants  the issuance of convertible debt  and product sales 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
in early  we undertook restructuring activities in connection with the closure of our cambridge  massachusetts office which primarily include one time termination costs  such as severance costs related to the elimination of duplicative positions and separation costs due to executive employment agreements  charges associated with the closure of the leased office space and one time relocation costs for the employees whose employment positions have been moved to our san diego location 
as a result of the plan  we have achieved  and expect to continue to achieve  operating efficiencies in future periods related to salary and overhead costs related to general and administrative costs 
during  we have incurred total restructuring expense of million and have restructuring accruals as of december  of million  for which payments are expected to be substantially completed in early capital requirements as of december   we had available cash and cash equivalents of approximately million  and restricted cash of million 
pursuant to the terms of the sale of the lc business to bp in  million of the restricted cash is held in escrow and is subject to the terms of an escrow agreement  to cover our indemnification obligations for potential liabilities and breaches of representations and warranties made by us  most of which survive for a period of months following the closing  bp has made a claim for indemnification by us pursuant to the escrow agreement in connection with a claim made by university of florida research foundation  inc  or ufrf  against bp relating to a license granted by ufrf to verenium biofuels corporation now known as bp biofuels advanced technology  inc  which was acquired by bp in the transaction 
bp has directed the escrow agent not to disburse the million in escrow pending resolution of the indemnification claim 
verenium has directed the escrow agent to distribute million of the amount held in escrow  which amount was to have been previously disbursed solely at the direction of verenium 
the escrow agent has not disbursed such amount to date  and verenium has filed for arbitration of the dispute regarding immediate distribution of million of the amount in escrow 
the remaining million will remain in escrow pending resolution of the ufrf claim against bp 
verenium believes that the ufrf claim against bp  and the bp claim against verenium for indemnity pertaining to the ufrf claim  are without merit 
historically  we have funded our capital requirements through available cash  issuances of debt and equity  product  collaboration and grant revenue  capital leases and equipment financing  and line of credit agreements 
in september we raised approximately million net of transaction costs through the sale of our lc business 
the holders of the notes have the right to require us to purchase the notes for a total cash amount equal to million on april   plus accrued and unpaid interest to such date 
we expect the holders of our notes to exercise this right and  based on our current cash resources and operating plan  our existing cash resources will not be sufficient to meet the cash requirements to fund our required repurchase of the notes  planned operating expenses  capital expenditures and working capital requirements without additional sources of cash 
if we are unable to fund the repurchase of the notes when required or otherwise raise additional capital  we will need to defer  reduce or eliminate significant planned expenditures  restructure or significantly curtail our operations  sell some or all of our assets  file for bankruptcy or cease operations 
to the extent we restructure rather than repurchase all or any portion of the notes  we may issue common shares or other convertible debt for the notes that are restructured  which would result in substantial dilution to our equityholders 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate and enter into definitive agreements related to any such transaction 

table of contents our independent registered public accounting firm has included an explanatory paragraph in its report on our consolidated financial statements related to the substantial doubt in our ability to continue as a going concern 
balance sheet our consolidated assets have decreased by million to million at december  from million at december  this decrease is primarily attributed to a decrease in cash of million attributable primarily to the repurchase of certain of our and notes of million  capital investment primarily for our new building of million  increase in restricted cash of million  payments against liabilities and general operating burn 
our consolidated liabilities have decreased by million to million at december  from million at december  the decrease is primarily attributable to the reduction in convertible notes carrying value of million from repurchases 
the remainder of the decrease is attributed to a reduction in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million primarily related to timing of cash payments  partially offset by i an increase in deferred revenue of million due to cash received in advance of revenue recognition most notably the upfront payment related to the novus collaboration  and ii the remaining restructuring accrual associated with the closing of the cambridge  massachusetts office space of million 
cash flows related to operating  investing and financing activities for the year ended december  we used million to fund our operations compared to million for the year ended december  although we had net income from continuing operations of million for the year ended december   million of such amount was related to non cash gain on debt extinguishment upon repurchase of convertible notes 
the remaining change in operating cash flows for the year ended december  primarily reflects an increase in accounts receivable and decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to timing of cash receipts and payments  partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue primarily related to an upfront cash payment received from novus in june in addition  during the year ended december  we received a license fee of million for a commercial enzyme candidate that syngenta participations ag formally licensed to a third party and assigned to us in conjunction with the separation agreement with syngenta in our investing activities for continuing operations used net cash of million for the year ended december  consisting of purchases of property and equipment for our new building and an increase in restricted cash attributed to our letter of credit required in conjunction with our lease agreement and required to be cash secured in accordance with the terms in our credit facility 
our financing activities for continuing operations used cash of million for the year ended december  due to our debt repurchases 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december   including the principal and interest payments for our notes  assuming such obligations are not redeemed pursuant to noteholder rights prior to maturity in april in thousands 
we do expect holders of our notes to exercise their rights to cause us to repurchase the notes on april  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years convertible debt notes principal of million and interest of million through april maturity contractual obligations operating lease san diego operating lease cambridge  net manufacturing costs to fermic license and research agreements total contractual obligations the holders of the notes have the right to require us to purchase the notes for cash including any accrued and unpaid interest on april  if the holders exercise their right to require us to purchase the notes for cash on april  as we expect them to do  the total obligation would be million  which would include million of interest  for the notes 
on june   we signed a lease agreement for  square feet for new office and laboratory space in san diego for a term of months from the first day of the first full month after the commencement date 
the agreement includes the build out of the space and has a targeted commencement date in june upon lease commencement  rent will be approximately  per month  which includes both base rent and a tenant improvement allowance 
the rent will be increased by on each anniversary of the first day of the first full month following the commencement date during the lease term 
in addition to the tenant allowance included in the base rent  a second tenant allowance option was exercised which must be paid back in monthly payments at a interest rate  and included in the amounts in the table 
the lease agreement provides for abatement of base rent including tenant allowances so long as no default has occurred  starting with the seventh full month of the lease term through the end of the sixteenth month of the lease term 
we lease approximately  square feet of office space in a building in cambridge  massachusetts 
the offices are leased to us under an operating lease with a term through december on december   we publicly announced that we were focusing all of our operations in san diego and closed our office in cambridge to better align us with the evolving needs of the business and the market 
the closure was effective on march  we completed a sublease agreement in may for the full cambridge facility  which will give us additional sublease income of approximately million from january through december and million from january through december  the end of the lease term 
pursuant to our manufacturing agreement with fermic  we are obligated to reimburse monthly costs related to manufacturing activities 
these costs scale up as our projected manufacturing volume increases 
under the terms of the agreement  we can cancel the committed purchases with months notice 
this commitment represents months of rent at current committed capacity  which is the maximum capacity allowed under the agreement 
manufacturing and supply agreements we have a manufacturing agreement with fermic to provide us with the capacity to produce commercial quantities of enzyme products  pursuant to which we pay fermic a fixed monthly rent for minimum committed 
table of contents manufacturing capacity 
under the terms of the agreement  we can cancel the committed purchases with months notice 
as of december   under this agreement our minimum commitments to fermic were approximately million over the next months 
in addition  under the terms of the agreement  we fund  in whole or in part  capital expenditures for certain equipment required for fermentation and downstream processing of our enzyme products 
since inception through december   we have incurred costs of approximately million for property and equipment related to this agreement  of which million we funded in our ongoing strategy is to remove our manufacturing bottlenecks  increase manufacturing efficiencies  and remove manufacturing variability  in order to manufacture more product and reduce our average production cost per unit 
for much of  we limited our marketing activities in line with our manufacturing capabilities 
in order to improve our manufacturing capabilities  support growth  and reduce our average unit cost  we plan to make up to million of additional capital investments at fermic during these investments should improve both our manufacturing yields and the profitability of our enzymes over time 
in  we contracted with genencor  which was at that time a subsidiary of danisco  to serve as a second source manufacturer for phyzyme xp phytase 
our supply agreement with danisco for phyzyme xp phytase contains provisions which allow danisco  with six months advance notice  to assume the right to manufacture phyzyme xp phytase 
if danisco were to exercise this right  we would also have the right to reduce our capacity commitment to fermic  nevertheless we may still experience significant excess capacity at fermic as a result 
if danisco assumed the right to manufacture phyzyme xp phytase and we were unable to absorb or otherwise reduce the excess capacity at fermic with other products  our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements that would give rise to additional material contractual obligations as of december  critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  long lived assets  accrued liabilities  convertible senior notes  and income taxes 
these estimates are based on historical experience  information received from third parties  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition we follow the provisions as set forth by authoritative accounting guidance 
we generally recognize revenue when we have satisfied all contractual obligations and we are reasonably assured of collecting the resulting receivable 
we are often entitled to bill our customers and receive payment from our customers in advance of recognizing the revenue under current accounting rules 
in those instances where we have billed our customers or received payment from our customers in advance of recognizing revenue  we include the amounts in deferred revenue on our balance sheet 
we recognize revenue related to the sale of our inventory as we ship or deliver products  provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
we recognize revenue from products sold through distributors or 
table of contents other third party arrangements upon shipment of the products  if the distributor has a right of return  provided that a the price is substantially fixed and determinable at the time of sale  b the distributor s obligation to pay us is not contingent upon resale of the products  c title and risk of loss passes to the distributor at time of shipment  d the distributor has economic substance apart from that provided by us  e we have no significant obligation to the distributor to bring about resale of the products  and f future returns can be reasonably estimated 
for any sales that do not meet all of the above criteria  revenue is deferred until all such criteria have been met 
we include revenue from our royalty on operating profit in product revenues on the statement of operations 
we recognize royalty revenues calculated as a share of profits  as defined by the agreement under which such royalties are paid  during the quarter in which such revenues are earned based on calculations provided by our partner 
to date  we have generated a substantial portion of our product revenues  including royalty  through our agreements with danisco 
we may record our quarterly royalty based on estimates from danisco  and the final calculation of the royalty is sometimes finalized in the subsequent quarter  accordingly  we are subject to potential adjustments to our actual royalty from quarter to quarter 
we have contracted with genencor  a subsidiary of danisco  to serve as a second source manufacturer of phyzyme xp phytase 
under current accounting guidance  product manufactured for us by genencor is recognized on a net basis equal to the royalty received from danisco  as all the following indicators of net revenue reporting are met i the third party is the obligor  ii the amount earned is fixed  and iii the third party maintains inventory risk  as compared to the full value of the manufacturing costs plus royalty we currently recognize for phyzyme xp phytase we manufacture 
we sometimes enter into revenue arrangements that include the delivery of more than one product or service 
in these cases  we recognize revenue from each element of the arrangement as long as we are able to determine a separate value for each element  we have completed our obligation to deliver or perform on that element and we are reasonably assured of collecting the resulting receivable 
effective january   in conjunction with the adoption of a new accounting pronouncement  for multiple deliverable agreements  including contract manufacturing agreements and license agreements  consideration is allocated at the inception of the agreement to all deliverables based on their relative selling price 
the relative selling price for each deliverable is determined using vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of selling price or third party evidence of selling price if vsoe does not exist 
if neither vsoe nor third party evidence of selling price exists  we use our best estimate of the selling price for the deliverable 
effective january   in conjunction with the adoption of a new accounting pronouncement  at the inception of each agreement that includes milestone payments  we evaluate whether each milestone is substantive and at risk to both parties on the basis of the contingent nature of the milestone  specifically reviewing factors such as the scientific and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the milestone  as well as the level of effort and investment required 
revenues from milestones  if they are nonrefundable and deemed substantive  are recognized upon successful accomplishment of the milestones 
milestones that are not considered substantive are accounted for as license payments and recognized on a straight line basis over the remaining period of performance 
share based compensation we calculate the fair value of all share based payments to employees and non employee directors  including grants of stock options  non restricted and restricted shares  and awards issued under our previous employee stock purchase plan  and amortize these fair values to share based compensation in the income statement over the respective vesting periods of the underlying awards 
share based compensation related to stock options includes the amortization of the fair value of options at the date of grant determined using the black scholes merton  or bsm valuation model 
we amortize the fair value of options to expense over the vesting periods of the underlying options using the accelerated recognition 
table of contents method 
under the accelerated method  an option is valued in multiple tranches as if the option was granted as multiple options  with each tranche valued separately  each with its own weighted average expected term and vesting term 
as a result of the accelerated method  approximately of a grant s expense will be recognized in the first year after grant 
we estimate the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using assumptions about volatility  expected life of the awards  risk free interest rate  and dividend yield rate 
the expected volatility in this model is based on the historical volatility of our common stock and an analysis of our peers 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time awards are granted  based on maturities which approximate the expected life of the options 
the expected life of the options granted is estimated using the historical exercise behavior of employees and an analysis of our peers 
the expected dividend rate takes into account the absence of any historical payments and management s intention to retain all earnings for future operations and expansion 
we estimate a forfeiture percentage based on historical experience as well as future expected company trends 
upon any material company event  the forfeiture estimate is reviewed and adjusted to the actual forfeiture or updated expected forfeiture rate 
we estimate the fair value of non restricted and restricted stock awards based upon the closing market price of our common stock at the date of grant 
we charge the fair value of non restricted awards to share based compensation upon grant 
we amortize the fair value of restricted awards to share based compensation expense over the vesting period of the underlying awards 
convertible debt and derivative accounting we adopted new guidance as issued on january  which significantly impacted the accounting for our notes by requiring us to account separately for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt 
the liability component is measured so that the effective interest expense associated with the convertible debt reflects the issuer s borrowing rate at the date of issuance for similar debt instruments without the conversion feature 
the difference between the cash proceeds associated with the convertible debt and this estimated fair value is recorded as a debt discount and amortized to interest expense over the life of the convertible debt 
determining the fair value of the liability component requires the use of accounting estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions are judgmental in nature and could have a significant impact on the determination of the liability component and  in effect  the associated interest expense 
according to the guidance  the carrying amount of the liability component is determined by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated equity component 
if no similar liabilities exist  estimates of fair value are primarily determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the liability component  including market interest rates  credit standing  yield curves and volatilities 
at inception  we perform an assessment of all embedded features of a debt instrument to determine if such features should be bifurcated and separately accounted for  and  if bifurcation requirements are met  whether such features should be classified and accounted for as equity or liability 
the fair value of the embedded feature is measured initially  included as a liability on the balance sheet  and remeasured each reporting period 
any changes in fair value are recorded in the statement of operations 
we monitor  on an ongoing basis  whether events or circumstances could give rise to a change in our classification of embedded features 
we accounted for the conversion of our notes in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance  which states that upon conversion the difference between the carrying value of the converted notes and the fair value of the common stock delivered to the noteholders is recorded as a gain loss on debt extinguishment in our consolidated statement of operations 

table of contents income taxes authoritative accounting guidance includes an exception to the general principle of intraperiod tax allocations 
this exception requires that all items ie  extraordinary items  discontinued operations  and so forth  including items charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income be considered in determining the amount of tax benefit that results from a loss from continuing operations 
as a result of net book income from discontinued operations  we recorded an income tax expense from discontinued operations of million and an income tax benefit from continuing operations of million during the year ended december   resulting in an overall annual income tax expense of zero 
effective in  we account for income taxes pursuant to authoritative accounting guidance  which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on our tax return 
we do not recognize an uncertain tax position as a deferred tax asset if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
we adopted the updated authoritative guidance on january   and commenced analyzing filing positions in all of the federal and state jurisdictions where we are required to file income tax returns  as well as all open tax years in these jurisdictions 
as a result of adoption  we have recorded no additional tax liability 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amounts  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase our income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
our deferred tax assets at december  were fully offset by a valuation allowance 
inventories we value inventory at the lower of cost first in  first out or market value and  if necessary  reduce the value by an estimated allowance for excess and obsolete inventories 
the determination of the need for an allowance is based on our review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales  as well as judgments  quality control testing data  and assumptions about the likelihood of obsolescence 
recently issued accounting standards information with respect to recent accounting standards is included in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is limited to interest rate risk and  to a lesser extent  foreign currency risk 
interest rate exposure as of december   the only debt subject to a variable interest rate pertained to our credit facilities with comerica 
advances under the credit facility bear interest rate equal to the daily adjusting london interbank offered rate plus a margin of 
all of our other outstanding debt obligations were comprised of fixed rate interest rates 
as of december  we did not have an amount outstanding under our variable interest rate credit facilities 

table of contents foreign currency exposure we engage third parties  including fermic  our contract manufacturing partner in mexico city  to provide various services 
from time to time certain of these services result in obligations that are denominated in other than us dollars 
additionally  under our manufacturing and sales agreement with danisco  we sell our phyzyme xp phytase inventory to danisco at our cost and  under a license agreement  receive a royalty equal to of danisco s profit from the sale of the product  as defined  when the product is sold to danisco s customer 
this profit share is denominated in other than us dollars and is converted to us dollars upon payment 
consequently  our reported revenue may be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates
