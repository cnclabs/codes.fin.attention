item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
general the following discussion pertains to emmis communications corporation ecc and its subsidiaries collectively  emmis or the company 
we own and operate radio and publishing properties located primarily in the united states 
our revenues are mostly affected by the advertising rates our entities charge  as advertising sales represent more than of our consolidated revenues 
these rates are in large part based on our entities ability to attract audiences subscribers in demographic groups targeted by their advertisers 
arbitron inc generally measures radio station ratings weekly for markets measured by the portable people meter tm and four times a year for markets measured by diaries 
because audience ratings in a station s local market are critical to the station s financial success  our strategy is to use market research  advertising and promotion to attract and retain audiences in each station s chosen demographic target group 
our revenues vary throughout the year 
as is typical in the broadcasting industry  our revenues and operating income are usually lowest in our fourth fiscal quarter 
on november   the company announced that under the terms of its senior unsecured notes  the company has the ability to either purchase or purchase rights in up to million of its outstanding series a cumulative convertible preferred stock 
emmis  in november and january  either purchased or purchased rights in  shares of series a cumulative convertible preferred stock on four separate occasions at an average price of per share 
no further series a cumulative convertible preferred share purchases or purchase of rights in the preferred shares are permitted as the availability under the senior unsecured notes has expired 
any prior share repurchase program is no longer operative 
in addition to the sale of advertising time for cash  stations typically exchange advertising time for goods or services  which can be used by the station in its business operations 
these barter transactions are recorded at the estimated fair value of the product or service received 
we generally confine the use of such trade transactions to promotional items or services for which we would otherwise have paid cash 
in addition  it is our general policy not to preempt advertising spots paid for in cash with advertising spots paid for in trade 
the following table summarizes the sources of our revenues for the past three years 
all revenues generated by our international radio properties are included in the local category 
the category non traditional principally consists of ticket sales and sponsorships of events our stations and magazines conduct in their local markets 
the category other includes  among other items  revenues generated by the websites of our entities  and barter 
year ended february  of total of total of total net revenues local national political publication sales non traditional other total net revenues a significant portion of our expenses varies in connection with changes in revenue 
these variable expenses primarily relate to costs in our sales department  such as salaries  commissions and bad debt 
our costs that do not vary as much in relation to revenue are mostly in our programming and general and administrative departments  such as talent costs  syndicated programming fees  utilities  office expenses and salaries 
lastly  our costs that are highly discretionary are costs in our marketing and promotions department  which we primarily incur to maintain and or increase our audience and market share 
known trends and uncertainties although advertising revenues have stabilized following the recent global recession  domestic radio revenue growth has been challenged for several years 
management believes this is principally the result of three factors the proliferation of advertising inventory caused by the emergence of new media  such as various media distributed via the internet  telecommunication companies and cable interconnects  as well as social networks and social coupon sites  all of which are gaining advertising share against radio and other traditional media  the perception of investors and advertisers that satellite radio and portable media players diminish the effectiveness of radio advertising  and the adoption of a new method of gathering ratings data  which has shown an increase in cumulative audience size  but a decrease in time spent listening as compared to the previous method of gathering ratings data 
the company and the radio industry have begun several initiatives to address these issues 
the radio industry is working aggressively to increase the number of portable digital media devices that contain an fm tuner  including smartphones and music players 
in many countries  fm tuners are common features in portable digital media devices 
the radio industry is working with leading united states network providers  device manufacturers  regulators and legislators to ensure that fm tuners are included in future portable digital media devices 
including fm as a feature on these devices has the potential to increase radio listening and improve perception of the radio industry while offering network providers the benefits of a proven emergency notification system  reduced network congestion from audio streaming services  and a host of new revenue generating applications 
the company has also aggressively worked to harness the power of broadband and mobile media distribution in the development of emerging business opportunities by becoming one of the fifteen largest streaming audio providers in the united states  developing highly interactive websites with content that engages our listeners  using sms texting and delivering real time traffic to navigation devices 
we have created the loud digital network  which combines our original content with other music and entertainment content to form one of the ten largest music and entertainment networks on the internet 
along with the rest of the radio industry  the majority of our stations have deployed hd radio 
hd radio offers listeners advantages over standard analog broadcasts  including improved sound quality and additional digital channels 
to make the rollout of hd radio more efficient  a consortium of broadcasters representing a majority of the radio stations in nearly all of our markets have agreed to work together in each radio market to ensure the most diverse consumer offering possible and to accelerate the rollout of hd radio receivers  particularly in automobiles 
in addition to offering secondary channels  the hd radio spectrum allows broadcasters to transmit other forms of data 
we are participating in a joint venture with other broadcasters to provide the bandwidth that a third party will use to transmit location based data to hand held and in car navigation devices 
it is unclear what impact hd radio will have on the markets in which we operate 
arbitron inc  the supplier of ratings data for united states radio markets  has developed technology to passively collect data for its ratings service 
the portable people meter tm ppm tm is a small  pager sized device that does not require any active manipulation by the end user and is capable of automatically measuring radio  television  internet  satellite radio and satellite television signals that are encoded for the service by the broadcaster 
the ppm tm offers a number of advantages over the traditional diary ratings collection system including ease of use  more reliable ratings data and shorter time periods between when advertising runs and when audience listening or viewing habits can be reported 
this service began in the new york and los angeles markets in october  in the st 
louis market in october  and the austin and indianapolis markets in the fall of in each market in which the service has launched  there has been a compression in the relative ratings of all stations in the market  increasing the competitive pressure within the market for advertising dollars 
in addition  ratings for certain stations when measured by the ppm tm as opposed to the traditional diary methodology can be materially different 
the results of our domestic radio operations are heavily dependent on the results of our stations in the new york and los angeles markets 
these markets account for nearly of our domestic radio net revenues 
during fiscal  kpwr fm in los angeles experienced revenue growth that was better than the overall los angeles radio market  whereas our new york cluster trailed the revenue performance of the new york market due to weak performance at our adult urban station  wrks fm 
subsequent to february   we entered into a lma for wrks fm 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more discussion 
our results in new york and los angeles are often more volatile than our larger competitors due to our lack of scale in these markets 
we are overly dependent on the performance of one or two stations in these markets  and as the competitive environment shifts  our ability to adapt is limited 
furthermore  some of our competitors that operate larger station clusters in new york and los angeles are able to leverage their market share to extract a greater percentage of available advertising revenue through discounting unit rates 
as part of our business strategy  we continually evaluate potential acquisitions of radio stations  publishing properties and other businesses that we believe hold promise for long term appreciation in value and leverage our strengths 
however  emmis operating company s the company s principal operating subsidiary  hereinafter eoc credit agreement substantially limits our ability to make acquisitions 
we also regularly review our portfolio of assets and may opportunistically dispose of assets when we believe it is appropriate to do so 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the sale of a controlling interest in one of our radio stations in new york and our two radio stations in chicago 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that encompass significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially derive materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are those described below 
revenue recognition broadcasting revenue is recognized as advertisements are aired 
publication revenue is recognized in the month of delivery of the publication 
both broadcasting revenue and publication revenue recognition is subject to meeting certain conditions such as persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists and collection is reasonably assured 
these criteria are generally met at the time the advertisement is aired for broadcasting revenue and upon delivery of the publication for publication revenue 
advertising revenues presented in the financial statements are reflected on a net basis  after the deduction of advertising agency fees  usually at a rate of of gross revenues 
allowance for doubtful accounts an allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded based on management s judgment of the collectability of receivables 
when assessing the collectability of receivables  management considers  among other things  historical loss experience and existing economic conditions 
fcc licenses and goodwill we have made acquisitions in the past for which a significant amount of the purchase price was allocated to fcc licenses and goodwill assets 
as of february   we have recorded approximately million in goodwill and fcc licenses  which represents approximately of our total assets 
in the case of our us radio stations  we would not be able to operate the properties without the related fcc license for each property 
fcc licenses are renewed every eight years  consequently  we continually monitor our stations compliance with the various regulatory requirements 
historically  all of our fcc licenses have been renewed at the end of their respective periods  and we expect that all fcc licenses will continue to be renewed in the future 
we consider our fcc licenses to be indefinite lived intangibles 
our foreign broadcasting licenses expire during periods ranging from february to february we will need to submit applications to extend our foreign licenses upon their expiration to continue our broadcast operations in these countries 
while there is a general expectancy of renewal of radio broadcast licenses in most countries and we expect to actively seek renewal of our foreign licenses  most of the countries in which we operate do not have the regulatory framework or history that we have with respect to license renewals in the united states 
this makes the risk of non renewal or of renewal on less favorable terms of foreign licenses greater than for united states licenses  as was demonstrated in hungary when our broadcasting license was not renewed in november under circumstances that even a hungarian court ruled violated hungarian law and various bilateral investment treaties 
we treat our foreign broadcasting licenses as definite lived intangibles and amortize them over their respective license periods 
we do not amortize goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets  but rather test for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired 
when evaluating our radio broadcasting licenses for impairment  the testing is performed at the unit of accounting level as determined by accounting standards codification asc topic in our case  radio stations in a geographic market cluster are considered a single unit of accounting  provided that they are not being operated under a local marketing agreement by another broadcaster 
we complete our annual impairment tests on december of each year and perform additional interim impairment testing whenever triggering events suggest such testing is warranted 
valuation of indefinite lived broadcasting licenses fair value of our fcc licenses is estimated to be the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
to determine the fair value of our fcc licenses  the company uses an income valuation method when it performs its impairment tests 
under this method  the company projects cash flows that would be generated by each of its units of accounting assuming the unit of accounting was commencing operations in its respective market at the beginning of the valuation period 
this cash flow stream is discounted to arrive at a value for the fcc license 
the company assumes the competitive situation that exists in each market remains unchanged  with the exception that its unit of accounting commenced operations at the beginning of the valuation period 
in doing so  the company extracts the value of going concern and any other assets acquired  and strictly values the fcc license 
major assumptions involved in this analysis include market revenue  market revenue growth rates  unit of accounting audience share  unit of accounting revenue share and discount rate 
each of these assumptions may change in the future based upon changes in general economic conditions  audience behavior  consummated transactions  and numerous other variables that may be beyond our control 
the projections incorporated into our license valuations take into consideration then current economic conditions 
for example  in connection with our interim impairment assessment on august   the economic recession and credit crisis were considered as part of the assessment 
those events led to a further weakened and less profitable radio marketplace with a higher cost of capital  which impacted the interim assessment 
assumptions incorporated into the annual impairment testing as of december  were similar to those used in our december  annual impairment testing 
we expect the ongoing recovery in radio revenues to continue throughout our fiscal below are some of the key assumptions used in our annual and interim impairment assessments 
the methodology used to value our fcc licenses has not changed in the three year period ended february  august  december  december  december  discount rate long term revenue growth rate mature market share operating profit margin valuation of goodwill asc topic requires the company to test goodwill for impairment at least annually using a two step process 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of impairment 
the company conducts the two step impairment test on december of each fiscal year  unless indications of impairment exist during an interim period 
when assessing its goodwill for impairment  the company uses an enterprise valuation approach to determine the fair value of each of the company s reporting units radio stations grouped by market and magazines on an individual basis 
management determines enterprise value for each of its reporting units by multiplying the two year average station operating income generated by each reporting unit current year based on actual results and the next year based on budgeted results by an estimated market multiple 
the company uses a blended station operating income trading multiple of publicly traded radio operators as a benchmark for the multiple it applies to its radio reporting units 
there are no publicly traded publishing companies that are focused predominantly on city and regional magazines as is our publishing segment 
therefore  the market multiple used as a benchmark for our publishing reporting units is based on recently completed transactions within the city and regional magazine industry or analyst reports that include valuations of magazine divisions within publicly traded media conglomerates 
for the annual assessment performed as of december   the company applied a market multiple of times and times the reporting unit s operating performance for our radio and publishing reporting units  respectively 
management believes this methodology for valuing radio and publishing properties is a common approach and believes that the multiples used in the valuation are reasonable given our peer comparisons and market transactions 
to corroborate the step one reporting unit fair values determined using the market approach described above  management also uses an income approach  which is a discounted cash flow method to determine the fair value of the reporting unit 
this enterprise valuation is compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit for the first step of the goodwill impairment test 
if the reporting unit exhibits impairment  the company proceeds to the second step of the goodwill impairment test 
for its step two testing  the enterprise value is allocated among the tangible assets  indefinite lived intangible assets fcc licenses valued using a direct method valuation approach and unrecognized intangible assets  such as customer lists  with the residual amount representing the implied fair value of the goodwill 
to the extent the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  the difference is recorded as an impairment charge in the statement of operations 
the methodology used to value our goodwill has not changed in the three year period ended february  sensitivity analysis based on the results of our december  annual impairment assessment  the fair value of our broadcasting licenses was approximately million which was in excess of the million carrying value by million  or 
the fair values exceeded the carrying values of all of our units of accounting 
should our estimates or assumptions worsen  or should negative events or circumstances occur in the units that have limited fair value cushion  additional license impairments may be needed 
radio broadcasting licenses as of february  december  percentage by which fair unit of accounting carrying value fair value value exceeds carrying value new york cluster kxos fm los angeles austin cluster st 
louis cluster indianapolis cluster kpwr fm los angeles terre haute cluster total our annual impairment testing on december  did not result in an impairment charge 
if we were to assume a change in any of our three key assumptions a reduction in the long term revenue growth rate  a reduction in local commercial share or an increase in the discount rate used to determine the fair value of our broadcasting licenses on december   the resulting impairment charge would have been million  million and million  respectively 
also  if we were to assume a market multiple decrease of one or a decrease in the two year average station operating income  two of the key assumptions used to determine the fair value of our goodwill on december   the resulting estimates of enterprise valuations would still exceed the carrying values of the enterprises 
as such  step two of the goodwill impairment testing would not be required  thus no impairment would be recognized if these two key assumptions were lowered 
the sharp economic downturn in late and throughout calendar negatively impacted the radio broadcasting industry as advertising revenues declined and expectations for near term growth declined throughout most of calendar the projected revenue growth levels for the industry when we completed our interim impairment testing on august  were lower than we had originally forecasted when we completed our fiscal annual impairment test on december  this decline caused us to record further impairment to broadcasting licenses and goodwill as part of our august  impairment review 
as revenues decline  profitability levels are also negatively impacted as fixed costs represent a significant component of a radio station s operating expenses 
as a result  the fair value of our asset base is particularly sensitive to the impact of declining revenues 
deferred taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequence of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or income tax returns 
income taxes are recognized during the year in which the underlying transactions are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations 
deferred taxes are provided for temporary differences between amounts of assets and liabilities as recorded for financial reporting purposes and amounts recorded for income tax purposes 
after determining the total amount of deferred tax assets  the company determines whether it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
if the company determines that a deferred tax asset is not likely to be realized  a valuation allowance will be established against that asset to record it at its expected realizable value 
insurance claims and loss reserves the company is self insured for most healthcare claims  subject to stop loss limits 
claims incurred but not reported are recorded based on historical experience and industry trends  and accruals are adjusted when warranted by changes in facts and circumstances 
the company had million and million accrued for employee healthcare claims as of february  and  respectively 
the company also maintains large deductible programs ranging from thousand to thousand per occurrence for workers compensation  employment liability  automotive liability and media liability claims 
acquisitions  dispositions and investments the transactions described below impact the comparability of operating results for the three years ended february  sale of controlling interest in wrxp fm  wkqx fm and wlup fm on september   the company completed the sale of a controlling interest in merlin media  llc merlin media  which owns the following radio stations i wkqx fm  mhz  channel  chicago  il fin  ii wrxp fm  mhz  channel  new york  ny fin and iii wlup fm  mhz  channel  chicago  il fin collectively the merlin stations 
the company received gross cash sale proceeds of million in the transaction  and incurred approximately million of expenses  principally consisting of severance  state and local taxes  and professional and other fees and expenses 
the company used the net cash proceeds to repay approximately of the term loans outstanding under its credit facility 
emmis also paid a million exit fee to its largest lender related to the repayment of extended term loans on september  on september   subsidiaries of emmis entered into the nd amended restated limited liability company agreement the llc agreement of merlin media  together with merlin holdings  llc merlin holdings  an affiliate of investment funds managed by gtcr  llc  and benjamin l 
homel aka randy michaels together with merlin holdings  the investors 
in connection with the completion of the disposition of assets to merlin media and sale of a controlling interest in merlin media pursuant to the purchase agreement dated june  among the company  merlin holdings and mr 
homel the purchase agreement  the company retained preferred equity and common equity interests in merlin media  the terms of which are governed by the llc agreement 
the company s common equity interests in merlin media represented of the initial outstanding common equity interests of merlin media and are subject to dilution if the company fails to participate pro rata in future capital calls 
the fair value of the company s common equity ownership of merlin media llc as of september  was approximately million  and accounted for under the equity method 
the company s preferred equity interests in merlin media consist of approximately million at par of non redeemable perpetual preferred interests  on which a preferred return accretes quarterly at a rate of per annum 
the fair value of this preferred equity interest as of september   was approximately million and is accounted for under the cost method 
the preferred interests held by the company are junior to non redeemable perpetual preferred interests held by the investors of approximately million  on which a preferred return accretes quarterly at a rate of per annum 
the preferred interests held by the company and the investors are both junior to a million senior secured note issued to an affiliate of merlin holdings 
the note matures five years from closing  and interest accrues on the note semi annually at a rate of per annum  payable in cash or in kind at merlin media s election 
distributions in respect of merlin media s common and preferred interests are made when declared by merlin media s board of managers 
given the company s continued equity interests in the stations  it is precluded from reclassifying the operating results of the stations to discontinued operations 
upon deconsolidation  emmis recorded the retained common and preferred equity interests at fair value 
the fair value of our investments in merlin media llc was calculated using the black scholes option pricing model 
the model s inputs reflect assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the instrument in a current period transaction based upon estimated future cash flows and other estimates at september  inputs to the model include stock volatility  dividend yields  expected term of the derivatives and risk free interest rates 
results from the valuation model in one period may not be indicative of future period measurements 
merlin media changed the format of wkqx fm in chicago and wrxp fm in new york from a music intensive format to a news talk format 
both stations have incurred substantial start up losses well in excess of the original business model used in the september  valuation 
neither station is now expected to achieve the estimated cash flows used in the september  valuation 
consequently  as of february   it was determined that future cash flows will be substantially lower than the estimated cash flows used in the september  valuation of our retained common and preferred equity interests 
as such  emmis reassessed the fair value of its retained common and preferred equity interests using the same valuation methodology described above with updated assumptions  and determined that the retained common and preferred equity interests were fully impaired 
the company believes that the magnitude of the impairment and the potentially prolonged recovery period indicate that the impairment is other than temporary 
as such  emmis wrote off the remaining carrying value of its investments in merlin media llc 
the total equity method loss and other than temporary impairment loss recognized related to merlin media llc of million is recognized in other income expense  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
under the llc agreement  the company is entitled initially to appoint one out of five members of merlin media s board of managers and has limited consent rights with respect to specified transactions 
the company has no obligation to make ongoing capital contributions to merlin media  but as noted above is subject to dilution if it fails to participate pro rata in future capital calls 
merlin media is a private company and the company will have limited ability to sell its interests in merlin media  except pursuant to customary tag along rights with respect to sales by merlin media s controlling investor or  after five years  in a private sale to third parties subject to rights of first offer held by the controlling investor 
the company has customary registration rights and is subject to a drag along right of the controlling investor 
on september   the compensation committee of the company s board of directors approved a discretionary bonus of million to certain employees that were key participants in the merlin media transaction 
the discretionary bonus is reflected in corporate expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization expense during the year ended february  sale of glendale  ca tower site on april   emmis sold land  towers and other equipment at its glendale  ca tower site to richland towers management flint  inc for million in cash 
in connection with the sale  emmis recorded a gain on sale of assets of approximately million 
net proceeds from the sale were used to repay amounts outstanding under the credit facility 
purchase of of bulgarian radio networks during the quarter ended may   emmis completed a series of transactions with its noncontrolling partners of two of our bulgarian radio networks that gave emmis ownership in those networks 
the purchase price of these transactions totaled million in cash  and a substantial portion was allocated to goodwill which was then determined to be substantially impaired 
emmis recorded an impairment loss of million related to bulgarian goodwill during the quarter ended may  sale of belgium radio operations on may   emmis sold the stock of its belgium radio operation to alfacam group nv  a belgian corporation  for euros 
emmis recognized a gain on the sale of its belgium radio operations of million  which included a gain of million related to the transfer of cumulative translation adjustments 
the gain on sale of the belgium radio operations is included in discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
emmis desired to exit belgium as its financial performance in the market failed to meet expectations 
the sale allowed emmis to eliminate further operating losses 
results of operations year ended february  compared to year ended february  net revenues for the years ended february  change change as reported  amounts in thousands net revenues radio publishing total net revenues radio net revenues decreased principally due to the july  commencement of a local marketing agreement lma related to the merlin stations and the ultimate sale of a controlling interest in these stations on september  during the time these stations were operated pursuant to the lma  emmis recorded  as net revenue  a million monthly lma fee  but did not record advertising sales during this period 
given the company s continued equity interests in the stations  it is precluded from reclassifying the operating results of the stations to discontinued operations 
excluding the merlin stations  radio net revenues would have increased million or 
we typically monitor the performance of our domestic stations against the aggregate performance of the markets in which we operate based on reports for the periods prepared by miller kaplan 
miller kaplan reports are generally prepared on a gross revenues basis and exclude revenues from barter arrangements 
a summary market revenue performance and emmis revenue performance in those markets for the year ended february  is presented below for the year ended february  overall market emmis market revenue performance revenue performance new york los angeles st 
louis indianapolis austin all markets as previously discussed  our new york radio cluster significantly trailed market performance  mostly due to direct format competition for wrks fm

this increase is predominately due to merit wage increases in fiscal following wage freezes and reductions in recent years  coupled with targeted investments in sales training and enhancements in our digital capabilities 
publishing operating expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization expense were flat due to expense control given the weak local advertising markets corporate expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense for the years ended february  change change as reported  amounts in thousands corporate expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense corporate expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization expense  increased principally due to i approximately million of indirect costs associated with the preferred stock transactions discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  ii approximately million of costs associated with the rd amendment to the company s credit agreement discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  iii a million bonus paid to certain employees in connection with the sale of the merlin stations and iv a million discretionary bonus paid to substantially all corporate employees during the quarter ended august  during the year ended february  the company recorded million of costs associated with a potential going private transaction discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements

our annual impairment testing as of december  resulted in no additional impairment losses 
due to the stabilization in the economy and a recovery in radio revenues  we do not expect to record in the foreseeable future impairment losses similar to the loss recorded for our austin radio fcc licenses 
accordingly  we do not expect historical operating results to be indicative of future operating results 
depreciation and amortization for the years ended february  change change as reported  amounts in thousands depreciation and amortization radio publishing corporate total depreciation and amortization the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended february  is mostly attributable to the sale of the merlin stations on september  additionally  our international broadcasting license in slovakia  a definite lived intangible asset  was extended from february to february  which decreased annual amortization expense

we recorded a provision for income taxes in the year ended february  despite our pre tax loss due to the valuation allowance we record against our deferred tax assets 
the company is recording a valuation allowance for its net deferred tax assets  including its net operating loss carryforwards  but excluding deferred tax liabilities related to indefinite lived intangibles 
income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax for the years ended february  change as reported  amounts in thousands income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax our hungarian radio operations and the operations of our flint peak tower site have been classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements 
the increase in income from discontinued operations  net of tax  for the year ended february  mostly relates to the gain on sale of the flint peak tower site

the shares that emmis purchased rights in are considered extinguished from an accounting perspective  and thus emmis recognized a gain on extinguishment of the preferred stock equal to the difference of the acquisition price and the carrying amount of the preferred stock 
year ended february  compared to year ended february  net revenues for the years ended february  change change as reported  amounts in thousands net revenues radio publishing total net revenues radio net revenues increased principally as a result of general economic growth in our domestic radio markets as the economy recovers from the recent recession

the company was in compliance with all financial and non financial covenants of the credit agreement  as amended  as of february  our liquidity as defined in the credit agreement as of february  was million and our consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit agreement was million 
the impairment charge recorded by the company during the year ended february  was noncash and had no impact on our liquidity or debt covenant compliance 
the company continually projects its anticipated cash needs  which include its operating needs  capital needs  principal and interest payments on its indebtedness and preferred stock dividends 
as of the filing of this form k  management believes the company can meet its liquidity needs through the end of fiscal year with cash and cash equivalents on hand  projected cash flows from operations  cash from transactions outlined in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  and  to the extent necessary  through its borrowing capacity under the credit agreement  which was approximately million at february  based on these projections  and the transactions outlined in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  management also believes the company will be in compliance with its debt covenants through the end of fiscal year sources of liquidity our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operations and cash available through revolver borrowings under our credit facility 
our primary uses of capital during the past few years have been  and are expected to continue to be  capital expenditures  working capital  debt service requirements and the repayment of debt 
at february   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and net working capital of million

cash and cash equivalents held at various european banking institutions at february  and was million and million which includes approximately million and million of cash related to our slager discontinued operation which is classified as current assets discontinued operations in the consolidated balance sheets  respectively 
our ability to access our share of these international cash balances net of noncontrolling interests is limited by country specific statutory requirements 
during the year ended february   working capital decreased million 
the decrease in net working capital primarily relates to the reclassification of our revolver to current maturities of long term debt as the revolver matures in november and lower accounts receivable as of february  since we manage cash on a consolidated basis  any cash needs of a particular segment or operating entity are met by intercompany transactions 
see investing activities below for a discussion of specific segment needs 
the company previously entered into three separate three year interest rate exchange agreements  whereby the company paid a fixed rate of notional principal in exchange for a variable rate on the same amount of notional principal based on the three month libor 
the counterparties to these agreements were global financial institutions 
one of these interest rate exchange agreements matured in march and the remaining two matured in march operating activities cash flows provided by operating activities were million and million for the years ended february  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities was mainly attributable to a decrease in operating income coupled with higher interest expense 
cash flows provided by operating activities were million and million for the years ended february  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities was mainly attributable to changes in working capital 
the decrease in cash provided by working capital was largely driven by the receipt of million related to our national representation firm s performance guarantee and the collection of million for the first two years of lma fees for kxos fm  both of which occurred in the year ended february  these fiscal receipts are partially offset by the receipt of million related to the previously discussed federal tax refund during the year ended february  investing activities for the year ended february   cash provided by investing activities was million 
during the year ended february   the company sold a controlling interest in the merlin stations for million in cash  sold its flint peak tower site for million of net cash proceeds and sold its share of a partnership in which the sole asset is land in new jersey on which a transmission tower is located to the other partner for million of net cash proceeds 
the proceeds related to the flint peak tower sale are classified as cash provided by discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows 
partially offsetting the net cash proceeds on the sales described above was approximately million of capital expenditures 
for the year ended february   cash used in investing activities was million  almost all of which related to capital expenditures 
for the year ended february   cash used in investing activities was million 
this consisted of million of capital expenditures and million paid to purchase the noncontrolling interests share of our bulgarian radio networks  both of which were partially offset by million of cash received from the sale of property and equipment million of which related to our airplane purchased in fiscal and sold in fiscal 
in the years ended february  and  our capital expenditures were million  million and million  respectively 
capital expenditures for the year ended february  include approximately million related to a customer relationship management system 
recurring capital expenditures primarily relate to leasehold improvements to various office and studio facilities  broadcast equipment purchases  and tower upgrades 
we expect that future requirements for capital expenditures will include capital expenditures incurred during the ordinary course of business 
we expect to fund such capital expenditures with cash generated from operating activities and borrowings under our credit agreement 
financing activities cash flows used in financing activities were million  million and million for the years ended february  and  respectively 
cash used in financing activities for the year ended february  primarily relates to net payments related to our senior credit agreement of million  payments to either purchase or purchase rights in preferred stock of million  payments for other debt related costs of million and distributions to noncontrolling interests of million  all of which are partially offset by the issuance of senior unsecured notes of million 
cash flows used in financing activities during the year ended february  primarily relate to the net long term debt repayments of million and million used to pay distributions to noncontrolling interests million of which is related to slager and thus is classified as discontinued operations 
cash flows used in financing activities during the year ended february  primarily relate to the net long term debt repayments of million  payment of million of debt related fees and million used to pay distributions to noncontrolling interests million of which is related to slager and thus is classified as discontinued operations 
as of february   emmis had million of borrowings under the credit agreement million current and million long term  million of senior unsecured notes entirely long term and  excluding shares outstanding subject to total return swaps  million of preferred stock liquidation preference excluding undeclared dividends in arrears for shares outstanding in which the company has no economic rights through total return swaps of million 
approximately million of borrowings under the credit agreement bears interest pursuant to a grid under which to per annum is to be paid in cash and to per annum is to be paid in kind  subject to a minimum yield of per annum 
the remainder of the credit agreement debt bears interest  at our option  at a rate equal to the eurodollar rate or an alternative base rate plus a margin 
the senior unsecured notes compound quarterly at a rate of per annum and is paid in kind  except that during the continuance of any event of default the rate will be per annum payable on demand in cash 
as of february   our weighted average borrowing rate under our credit agreement was approximately 
including the senior unsecured notes  our weighted average borrowing rate at february  was 
subsequent to the execution of the third amendment  approximately million of borrowings under the credit agreement bears interest pursuant to a grid under which to per annum is to be paid in cash and to per annum is to be paid in kind  subject to a minimum yield of per annum see previous discussion under credit agreement 
the remainder of the debt bears interest  at our option  at a rate equal to the eurodollar rate or an alternative base rate plus a margin 
the debt service requirements of emmis over the next twelve month period are expected to be million for mandatory repayment of term notes under our credit agreement  million for revolver borrowings under our credit agreement as the revolver is set to mature on november   and a minimum of million related to interest on the extended term loans 
the company may  at its election  choose to pay a portion of the interest due on the extended term loans in kind 
the remainder of the credit agreement debt bears interest at variable rates and is not included in the debt service requirements previously discussed 
the terms of emmis preferred stock provide for a quarterly dividend payment of 
per share  when  as  and if declared by our board of directors on each january  april  july and october emmis last paid its quarterly dividend on october  as of february   undeclared dividends in arrears for shares outstanding in which the company has no economic rights through total return swaps totaled million  or per share of preferred stock 
the third amendment to our credit agreement prohibits the company from paying dividends on the preferred stock during the suspension period as defined in the credit agreement see liquidity and capital resources 
subject to the restrictions of the credit agreement  payment of future preferred stock dividends is at the discretion of the company s board of directors 
failure to declare and pay the dividend is not a default under the terms of the preferred stock 
however  since undeclared dividends in arrears exceed six quarters  the holders of the preferred stock exercised their right to elect two persons to our board of directors 
one of these directors  joseph r 
siegelbaum  resigned in november michelle d 
bergman was elected by the holders of the preferred stock to replace mr 
siegelbaum at a special meeting of shareholders on april  as of may   we had million available for additional borrowing under our credit facility  which is net of million in outstanding letters of credit 
availability under the credit facility depends upon our continued compliance with certain operating covenants and financial ratios 
emmis was in compliance with these covenants as of february  as part of our business strategy  we continually evaluate potential acquisitions of radio stations  publishing properties and other businesses that we believe hold promise for long term appreciation in value and leverage our strengths 
however  emmis operating company s credit agreement  as amended  substantially limits our ability to make acquisitions 
we also regularly review our portfolio of assets and may opportunistically dispose of assets when we believe it is appropriate to do so 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the sale of a controlling interest in one of our radio stations in new york and our two radio stations in chicago 
intangibles as of february   approximately of our total assets consisted of intangible assets  such as fcc broadcast licenses  goodwill  subscription lists and similar assets  the value of which depends significantly upon the operational results of our businesses 
in the case of our domestic radio stations  we would not be able to operate the properties without the related fcc license for each property 
fcc licenses are renewed every eight years  consequently  we continually monitor the activities of our stations for compliance with regulatory requirements 
historically  all of our fcc licenses have been renewed at the end of their respective eight year periods  and we expect that all of our fcc licenses will continue to be renewed in the future 
our various foreign broadcasting licenses in slovakia and bulgaria expire during periods ranging from february to february we will need to submit applications to seek to extend our foreign licenses upon their expiration to continue our broadcast operations in these countries 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance for comprehensive income which requires that all nonowner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in the two statement approach  the first statement should present total net income and its components followed consecutively by a second statement that should present total other comprehensive income  the components of other comprehensive income  and the total of comprehensive income 
also  the entity is required to present reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income on the face of the financial statements 
the new guidance should be applied retrospectively and is effective for the company on march  as this guidance only changes the format of the financial statements  the company does not expect this to have an impact on results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
in september  the fasb issued guidance to simplify how entities test goodwill for impairment 
the guidance permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step impairment test 
an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying value 
the company does not expect that this guidance  which will be effective for the company as of march   will have a material effect on the company s results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
seasonality our results of operations are usually subject to seasonal fluctuations  which result in higher second and third quarter revenues and operating income 
for our radio operations  this seasonality is due to the younger demographic composition of many of our stations 
advertisers increase spending during the summer months to target these listeners 
in addition  advertisers generally increase spending across all segments during the months of october and november  which are part of our third quarter  in anticipation of the holiday season 
inflation the impact of inflation on operations has not been significant to date 
however  there can be no assurance that a high rate of inflation in the future would not have an adverse effect on operating results  particularly since a significant portion of our senior bank debt is comprised of variable rate debt 
off balance sheet financings and liabilities other than interest rate swap agreements  which are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  and lease commitments  legal contingencies incurred in the normal course of business  contractual commitments to purchase goods and services and employment contracts for key employees  all of which are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company does not have any material off balance sheet financings or liabilities 
the company does not have any majority owned and controlled subsidiaries that are not included in the consolidated financial statements  nor does the company have any interests in or relationships with any special purpose entities that are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements or disclosed in the notes to consolidated financial statements
