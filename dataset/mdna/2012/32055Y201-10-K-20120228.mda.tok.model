the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of  or the dodd frank act  enacts significant changes in federal statutes governing banks and bank holding companies generally as well as other entities 
some of the significant changes are already in effect  additional significant changes will become effective in the near term and other significant changes require action by federal banking agencies  including the federal reserve  the principal federal regulator of the company 
except as otherwise noted  the following discussion assumes that provisions of the dodd frank act applicable to banks and bank holding companies to become effective in the near term are currently in effect 
financial and bank holding company the company is a bank holding company and has registered as a financial holding company under regulations issued by the federal reserve 
under federal law  the company is required to serve as a source of financial strength to the bank  including providing financial assistance to the bank if the bank experiences financial distress 
the federal banking agencies are required under the dodd frank act to issue joint rules to carry out the source of strength requirements 
as of december   the federal banking agencies had not issued rules establishing such source of strength requirements applicable to the company 
however  the federal reserve has indicated its intent to issue proposed rules to carry out the source of strength requirements in the first calendar quarter of under existing federal reserve source of strength policies  the federal reserve may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank 
the federal reserve may also determine that the bank holding company is engaging in unsafe and unsound practices if it fails to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank 

table of contents we are required by the bank holding company act to obtain federal reserve approval prior to acquiring  directly or indirectly  ownership or control of voting shares of any bank  if  after such acquisition  we would own or control more than of its voting stock 
under the dodd frank act  when acting on an application for approval the federal reserve is required to consider whether the transaction would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the united states banking or financial system 
under federal law and regulations  including the dodd frank act  a bank holding company may acquire banks in states other than its home state if the bank holding company is both well capitalized and well managed both before and after the acquisition 
the interstate acquisitions are subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time  not to exceed five years  and the requirement that the bank holding company not control  prior to or following the proposed acquisition  more than of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions nationwide or  unless the acquisition is the bank holding company s initial entry into the state  more than of such deposits in the state  or such lesser or greater amount set by state law of such deposits in that state 
with additional changes made to federal statutes under the dodd frank act  banks are also permitted to establish new branches in a state if a bank located in that state could establish a new branch at the proposed location without regard to state laws limiting interstate de novo branching 
banks may also merge across state lines 
a state can prohibit interstate mergers entirely or prohibit them if the continuing bank would control insured bank deposits in excess of a specified percentage of total insured bank deposits in the state  provided such prohibition does not discriminate against out of state banks 
under montana law  banks  bank holding companies and their respective subsidiaries cannot acquire control of a bank located in montana if  after the acquisition  the acquiring institution and its affiliates would directly or indirectly control  in the aggregate  more than of the total deposits of insured depository institutions located in montana 
we have voluntarily registered with the federal reserve as a financial holding company 
as a financial holding company  we may engage in certain business activities that are determined by the federal reserve to be financial in nature or incidental to financial activities as well as all activities authorized to bank holding companies generally 
in most circumstances  we must notify the federal reserve of our financial activities within a specified time period following our initial engagement in each business or activity 
if the type of proposed business or activity has not been previously determined by the federal reserve to be financially related or incidental to financial activities  we must receive the prior approval of the federal reserve before engaging in the activity 
we may engage in authorized financial activities  such as providing investment services  provided that we remain a financial holding company and meet certain regulatory standards of being well capitalized and well managed 
if we fail to meet the well capitalized or well managed regulatory standards  we may be required to cease our financial holding company activities or  in certain circumstances  to divest of the bank 
we do not currently engage in significant financial holding company businesses or activities not otherwise permitted for bank holding companies generally 
should we engage in certain financial activities currently authorized to financial holding companies  we may become subject to additional laws  regulations  supervision and examination by regulatory agencies 
in order to assess the financial strength of the bank holding company  the federal reserve and the state of montana also conducts throughout the year periodic onsite and offsite inspections and credit reviews of us 
the federal banking agencies  including the federal reserve  may also require additional information and reports from us 
in addition  the federal reserve may examine  and require reports and information regarding  any entity that we control  including entities other than banks or entities engaged in financial activities 
in certain circumstances  the federal reserve may require us to divest of non bank entities or limit the activities of those entities even if the activities are otherwise permitted to bank holding companies under governing law 
with limited exceptions  as of july   banks and their affiliates are not permitted to engage in proprietary trading  or invest in  or serve as an advisor to  hedge funds or private equity funds 
we have not historically engaged in any of those activities 
restrictions on transfers of funds to us and the bank dividends from the bank are the primary source of funds for the payment of our expenses of operating and for the payment of dividends 
under both state and federal law  the amount of dividends that may be paid by the bank from time to time is limited 
in general  the bank is limited to paying dividends that do not exceed the current year net profits together with retained earnings from the two preceding calendar years unless the prior consents of the montana and federal banking regulators are obtained 

table of contents a state or federal banking regulator may impose  by regulatory order or agreement of the bank  specific dividend limitations or prohibitions in certain circumstances 
the bank is not currently subject to a specific regulatory dividend limitation other than generally applicable limitations 
in general  banks are also prohibited from making capital distributions  including dividends and are prohibited from paying management fees to control persons if it would be undercapitalized under the regulatory framework for corrective action after making such payments 
see capital standards and prompt corrective action 
certain restrictive covenants that may exist in future debt instruments may also limit the bank s ability to make dividend payments to us 
also  under montana corporate law  a dividend may not be paid if  after giving effect to the dividend the company would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business  or the company s total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed  if the company were to be dissolved at the time of the dividend  to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of shareholders whose preferential rights are superior to those receiving the dividend 
furthermore  because we are a legal entity separate and distinct from the bank  our right to participate in the distribution of assets of the bank upon its liquidation or reorganization will be subject to the prior claims of the bank s creditors 
in the event of such a liquidation or other resolution  the claims of depositors and other general or subordinated creditors of the bank are entitled to a priority of payment of the claims of holders of any obligation of the bank to its shareholders  including us  or our shareholders or creditors 
restrictions on transactions with affiliates  directors and officers under the federal reserve act  the bank may not lend funds to  or otherwise extend credit to or for our benefit or the benefit of our affiliates  except on specified types and amounts of collateral and other terms required by state and federal law 
the limitation on lending may limit our ability to obtain funds from the bank for our cash needs  including funds for payment of dividends  interest and operational expenses 
the federal reserve also has authority to define and limit the transactions between banks and their affiliates 
the federal reserve s regulation w and relevant federal statutes  among other things  impose significant additional limitations on transactions in which the bank may engage with us  with each other  or with other affiliates 
federal reserve regulation o restricts loans to the bank and company insiders  which includes directors  officers and principal stockholders and their respective related interests 
all extensions of credit to the insiders and their related interests must be on the same terms as  and subject to the same loan underwriting requirements as  loans to persons who are not insiders 
in addition  regulation o imposes lending limits on loans to insiders and their related interests and imposes  in certain circumstances  requirements for prior approval of the loans by the bank board of directors 
capital standards and prompt corrective action banks and bank holding companies are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by state and federal banking agencies 
capital adequacy guidelines and  additionally for banks  prompt corrective action regulations  involve quantitative measures of assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components  risk weighting and other factors 
under the dodd frank act  the federal banking agencies are required to establish  by regulation or order  minimum capital requirements for insured depository organizations and the federal reserve is permitted to establish capital requirements  by regulation or order  for bank holding companies 
the minimum capital requirements to be established cannot be less than the minimum capital guidelines in effect when the dodd frank act was enacted 
the federal reserve is required to seek to make capital requirements countercyclical by increasing the amount of required capital during times of economic expansion and decreasing the amount of required capital during times of economic contraction 
the provisions of the dodd frank act  together with actions taken by the basel committee for the basel iii accords  may result in future regulatory minimum capital requirements that will exceed the regulatory minimum capital guidelines to which we are currently subject 

table of contents in  the federal reserve issued several requests for comments on proposed rules that  if adopted  would implement  among other things  the capital guideline requirements under the dodd frank act 
in most circumstances the proposed rules would apply only to bank holding companies or banks with consolidated assets in excess of billion 
some proposed rules would apply to bank holding companies or banks with consolidated assets in excess of billion 
because the company has consolidated assets of less than billion  none of the proposed rules  if adopted  would apply to the company or the bank 
the federal reserve has indicated its intent to issue additional proposed rules in addressing minimum capital and leverage requirements 
currently  the federal reserve board and the fdic have substantially similar risk based capital ratio and leverage ratio guidelines for banks similar in asset size to the bank 
the guidelines are intended to ensure that banks have adequate capital given the risk levels of assets and off balance sheet financial instruments 
under the guidelines  banking organizations are required to maintain minimum ratios for tier capital and total capital to risk weighted assets including certain off balance sheet items  such as letters of credit 
for purposes of calculating the ratios  a banking organization s assets and some of its specified off balance sheet commitments and obligations are assigned to various risk categories 
generally  under the applicable guidelines  a financial institution s capital is divided into two tiers 
these tiers are core capital tier 
tier capital includes common equity  noncumulative perpetual preferred stock excluding auction rate issues and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  less both goodwill adjusted for associated deferred tax liability and  with certain limited exceptions  all other intangible assets 
bank holding companies  however  may include up to a limit of of cumulative preferred stock in their tier capital 
supplementary capital tier 
tier capital includes  among other things  cumulative and limited life preferred stock  hybrid capital instruments  mandatory convertible securities  qualifying subordinated debt and the allowance for loan and lease losses  subject to certain limitations 
institutions that must incorporate market risk exposure into their risk based capital requirements may also have a third tier of capital in the form of restricted short term subordinated debt 
the dodd frank act provisions relating to required minimum capital also limit  in certain circumstances  the use of hybrid capital instruments in meeting regulatory capital requirements  including instruments similar to those which we currently have issued and outstanding 
however  because our total consolidated assets are substantially less than billion  the limitations on use of hybrid capital instruments are not expected to apply to us for the foreseeable future 
we  like other bank holding companies  are required under current guidelines to maintain tier capital and total capital the sum of tier and tier capital equal to at least and  respectively  of our total risk weighted assets 
the bank  like other depository institutions  is required to maintain similar capital levels under capital adequacy guidelines 
for a depository institution to be considered well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action its tier and total capital ratios must be at least and on a risk adjusted basis  respectively 
bank holding companies and banks are also required to comply with minimum leverage ratio requirements 
the leverage ratio is the ratio of a banking organization s tier capital to its total adjusted quarterly average assets as defined for regulatory purposes 
the current guidelines require a minimum leverage ratio of for financial holding companies and banks that either have the highest supervisory rating or have implemented the appropriate federal regulatory authority s risk adjusted capital measure for market risk 
all other financial holding companies and banks are required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of  unless a different minimum is specified by an appropriate regulatory authority 
for a depository institution to be considered well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  its leverage ratio must be at least 
the capital guidelines also provide that banking organizations experiencing significant internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels  without significant reliance on intangible assets 
in addition  the regulations of the bank regulators provide that concentration of credit risks  as well as an institution s ability to manage these risks  are important factors to be taken into account by regulatory agencies in assessing an organization s overall capital adequacy 
the federal reserve has not advised us of any specific minimum leverage ratio applicable to us or the bank 

table of contents the fdia requires  among other things  the federal banking agencies to take prompt corrective action in respect of depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements 
the fdia sets forth the following five capital tiers well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
a depository institution s capital tier will depend upon how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital measures and certain other factors  as established by regulation 
the relevant capital measures are the total capital ratio  the tier capital ratio and the leverage ratio 
under the regulations adopted by the federal regulatory authorities  a bank will be well capitalized if the institution has a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  a tier risk based capital ratio of or greater and a leverage ratio of or greater and is not subject to any order or written directive by any such regulatory authority to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure  adequately capitalized if the institution has a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  a tier risk based capital ratio of or greater and a leverage ratio of or greater in certain circumstances and is not well capitalized  undercapitalized if the institution has a total risk based capital ratio that is less than  a tier risk based capital ratio of less than or a leverage ratio of less than in certain circumstances  significantly undercapitalized if the institution has a total risk based capital ratio of less than  a tier risk based capital ratio of less than or a leverage ratio of less than  and critically undercapitalized if the institution s tangible equity is equal to or less than of average quarterly tangible assets 
an institution may be downgraded to  or deemed to be in  a capital category that is lower than indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters 
our regulatory capital ratios and those of the bank are in excess of the levels established for well capitalized institutions 
a bank s capital category is determined solely for the purpose of applying prompt corrective action regulations and the capital category may not constitute an accurate representation of the bank s overall financial condition or prospects for other purposes 
the fdia generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distributions including payment of a dividend or paying any management fee to its parent holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized 
undercapitalized institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan 
the agencies may not accept such a plan without determining  among other things  that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution s capital 
in addition  for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable  the depository institution s parent holding company must guarantee that the institution will comply with such capital restoration plan 
the aggregate liability of the parent holding company is limited to the lesser of an amount equal to of the depository institution s total assets at the time it became undercapitalized and the amount which is necessary or would have been necessary to bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards applicable with respect to such institution as of the time it fails to comply with the plan 
if a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan  it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized 
significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions  including mandated capital raising activities such as orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized  requirements to reduce total assets  restrictions for interest rates paid  removal of management and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks 
critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator 
a bank that is not well capitalized as defined by applicable regulations may  among other regulatory requirements or limitations  be prohibited under federal law and regulation from accepting or renewing brokered deposits 
the capital stock of banks organized under montana law  such as the bank  may be subject to assessment upon the direction of the montana department of administration under the montana bank act 
under the montana bank act  if the department of administration determines an impairment of a bank s capital exists  it may notify the bank s board of directors of the impairment and require the impairment be made good by an assessment on the bank stock 
if the bank fails to make good the impairment  the department of administration may  among other things  take charge of the bank and proceed to liquidate the bank 
under fdia  the appropriate federal banking agency may take certain actions with respect to significantly or critically undercapitalized institutions 
the actions may include requiring the sale of additional shares of the institution s stock or other actions deemed appropriate by the federal banking agency  which could include assessment on the institution s stock 

table of contents safety and soundness standards and other enforcement mechanisms the federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines establishing standards for safety and soundness  asset quality and earnings  internal controls and audit systems  among others  as required by the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act  or fdicia 
these standards are designed to identify potential concerns and ensure that action is taken to address those concerns before they pose a risk to the deposit insurance fund  or dif 
if a federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any of these standards  the agency may require the institution to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard 
if the institution fails to submit an acceptable plan within the time allowed by the agency or fails in any material respect to implement an accepted plan  the agency must  by order  require the institution to correct the deficiency 
federal banking agencies possess broad enforcement powers to take corrective and other supervisory action on an insured bank and its holding company 
moreover  federal laws require each federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of insured banks 
bank holding companies and insured banks are subject to a wide range of potential enforcement actions by federal regulators for violation of any law  rule  regulation  standard  condition imposed in writing by the regulator  or term of a written agreement with the regulator 
deposit insurance the fdic is an independent federal agency that insures deposits  up to prescribed statutory limits  of federally insured banks and savings institutions and safeguards the safety and soundness of the banking and savings industries 
the fdic insures our customer deposits through the dif up to prescribed limits for each depositor 
the maximum deposit insurance amount is  per depositor 
in addition  certain non interest bearing deposit accounts are accorded unlimited insurance until december  the amount of fdic assessments paid by each dif member institution is based on its relative risk of default as measured by regulatory capital ratios and other supervisory factors 
all fdic insured institutions are required to pay assessments to the fdic to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the financing corporation  or fico  an agency of the federal government established to recapitalize the predecessor to the dif 
the fico assessment rates  which are determined quarterly  averaged of insured deposits in fiscal these assessments will continue until the fico bonds mature in on november   the fdic imposed a prepayment requirement on most insured depository organizations  requiring that the organizations prepay estimated quarterly risk based assessments for the fourth quarter of and for each calendar quarter for calendar years  and the fdic has stated that the prepayment requirement was imposed in response to a negative balance in the dif 
as required by the dodd frank act the fdic changed its method of assessment of insurance premiums effective as of april  to an assessment based on the average total consolidated assets of the insured depository institution less the institutions average tangible equity for the assessment period and made other adjustments to the assessment calculation methods 
the changes reduced the deposit insurance premium paid by the bank from the amounts paid under the prior assessment method based on total deposits 
the fdic is also required to set its designated reserve ratio for each year at of estimated insured deposits and take actions necessary to reach a reserve ratio of of total estimated insured deposits by september  the fdic may be required to increase deposit insurance premium assessments to meet the reserve ratio requirements 
however  under the dodd frank act  the effects of any increases in deposit insurance premium assessments are to be offset for the benefit of depository institutions with total consolidated assets of less than billion 
the bank currently has total consolidated assets of less than billion 
insolvency of an insured depository institution if the fdic is appointed the conservator or receiver of an insured depository institution upon its insolvency or in certain other events  the fdic has the power  among other things to transfer any of the depository institution s assets and liabilities to a new obligor without the approval of the depository institution s creditors  to enforce the terms of the depository institution s contracts pursuant to their terms  or to repudiate or disaffirm any contract or lease to which the depository institution is a party  the performance of which is determined by the fdic to be burdensome and the disaffirmation or repudiation of which is determined by the fdic to promote the orderly administration of the depository institution 

table of contents depositor preference the fdia provides that  in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution  the claims of depositors of the institution  including the claims of the fdic as subrogee of insured depositors and certain claims for administrative expenses of the fdic as a receiver  will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution 
if an insured depository institution fails  insured and uninsured depositors  along with the fdic  will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured  non deposit creditors  including the parent bank holding company  with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution 
customer privacy and other consumer protections federal law imposes customer privacy requirements on any company engaged in financial activities  including the bank and us 
under these requirements  a financial company is required to protect the security and confidentiality of customer nonpublic personal information 
in addition  for customers who obtain a financial product such as a loan for personal  family or household purposes  a financial holding company is required to disclose its privacy policy to the customer at the time the relationship is established and annually thereafter 
the financial company must also disclose its policies concerning the sharing of the customer s nonpublic personal information with affiliates and third parties 
finally  a financial company is prohibited from disclosing an account number or similar item to a third party for use in telemarketing  direct mail marketing or marketing through electronic mail

in connection with its assessment of cra performance  the appropriate bank regulatory agency assigns a rating of outstanding  satisfactory  needs to improve or substantial noncompliance 
the bank received an outstanding rating on its most recent published examination 
although the bank s policies and procedures are designed to achieve compliance with all fair lending and cra requirements  instances of non compliance are occasionally identified through normal operational activities 
management responds proactively to correct all instances of non compliance and implement procedures to prevent further violations from occurring

item a 
risk factors like other financial and bank holding companies  we are subject to a number of risks  many of which are outside of our control 
if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors actually occurs  our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects could be harmed 
these risks are not the only ones that we may face 
other risks of which we are not aware  including those which relate to the banking and financial services industry in general and us in particular  or those which we do not currently believe are material  may harm our future business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
readers should consider carefully the following important factors in evaluating us  our business and an investment in our securities 
risks relating to the market and our business we may incur significant credit losses  particularly in light of recent and existing market conditions 
we take on credit risk by virtue of making loans and extending loan commitments and letters of credit 
our credit standards  procedures and policies may not prevent us from incurring substantial credit losses  particularly in light of market developments in recent years 
during and  we experienced deterioration in credit quality  particularly in certain real estate development loans  due  in part  to the impact resulting from the downturn in the prevailing economic  real estate and credit markets 
this deterioration resulted in higher levels of non performing assets  including other real estate owned  or oreo  and internally risk classified loans  thereby increasing our provisions for loan losses and decreasing our operating income in and as of december   we had total non performing assets of approximately million  compared with approximately million as of december  and approximately million as of december  in the first two months of  levels of non performing assets and provisions for loan losses have remained elevated  which will continue to affect our earnings 
although current economic conditions appear to be trending upwards  management believes we will continue to experience credit impairments and elevated levels of non performing loans in the near term  which will likely have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
our concentration of real estate loans subjects us to increased risks in the event real estate values continue to decline due to the economic recession  a further deterioration in the real estate markets or other causes 
at december   we had approximately billion of commercial  agricultural  construction  residential and other real estate loans  representing approximately of our total loan portfolio 
the recent economic recession  deterioration in the real estate markets and increasing delinquencies and foreclosures have had an adverse effect on the collateral value for many of our loans and on the repayment ability of many of our borrowers 
the continuation or further deterioration of these factors  including increasing foreclosures and unemployment  will continue to have the same or similar adverse effects 
in addition  these factors could reduce the amount of loans we make to businesses in the construction and real estate industry  which could negatively impact our interest income and results of operations 
a continued decline in real estate values could also lead to higher charge offs in the event of defaults in our real estate loan portfolio 
similarly  the occurrence of a natural or manmade disaster in our market areas could impair the value of the collateral we hold for real estate secured loans 
any one or a combination of the factors identified above could negatively impact our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 

table of contents economic and market developments  including the potential for inflation  may have an adverse effect on our business  possibly in ways that are not predictable or that we may fail to anticipate 
recent economic and market developments and the potential for continued economic disruptions and inflation represent considerable risks and challenges to us 
dramatic declines in the housing market  with decreased home prices and increased delinquencies and foreclosures throughout most of the nation  have negatively impacted the credit performance of mortgage and construction loans and resulted in significant write downs of assets by many financial institutions 
general downward economic trends  reduced availability of commercial credit and high levels of unemployment have also negatively impacted the credit performance of commercial and consumer credit  resulting in additional write downs 
these risks and challenges have significantly diminished overall confidence in the national economy  the financial markets and many financial institutions 
this reduced confidence could further compound the overall market disruptions and risks to banks and bank holding companies  including us 
many of our loans are to commercial borrowers  which have a higher degree of risk than other types of loans 
commercial loans  including commercial real estate loans  are often larger and involve greater risks than other types of lending 
because payments on such loans are often dependent on the successful operation or development of the property or business involved  repayment of such loans is more sensitive than other types of loans to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the general economy 
accordingly  the downturn in the real estate market and economy has heightened our risk related to commercial loans  particularly commercial real estate loans 
unlike residential mortgage loans  which generally are made on the basis of the borrowers ability to make repayment from their employment and other income and which are secured by real property whose value tends to be more easily ascertainable  commercial loans typically are made on the basis of the borrowers ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the commercial venture 
if the cash flow from business operations is reduced  the borrower s ability to repay the loan may be impaired 
due to the larger average size of each commercial loan as compared with other loans such as residential loans  as well as the collateral which is generally less readily marketable  losses incurred on a small number of commercial loans could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
at december   we had billion of commercial loans  including billion of commercial real estate loans  representing approximately of our total loan portfolio 
if we experience loan losses in excess of estimated amounts  our earnings will be adversely affected 
the risk of credit losses on loans varies with  among other things  general economic conditions  the type of loan being made  the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan and  in the case of a collateralized loan  the value and marketability of the collateral for the loan 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses based upon  among other things  historical experience  an evaluation of economic conditions and regular reviews of loan portfolio quality 
based upon such factors  our management makes various assumptions and judgments about the ultimate collectability of our loan portfolio and provides an allowance for loan losses 
these assumptions and judgments are complex and difficult to determine given the significant uncertainty surrounding future conditions in the general economy and banking industry 
if management s assumptions and judgments prove to be incorrect and the allowance for loan losses is inadequate  or if the banking authorities or regulations require us to increase the allowance for loan losses  our earnings  financial condition  results of operations and prospects could be significantly and adversely affected 
our goodwill may become impaired  which may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition and may limit our bank s ability to pay dividends to us  thereby causing liquidity issues 
the excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets from acquisitions  or goodwill  is evaluated for impairment at least annually and on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates that it is likely impairment has occurred 
in testing for impairment  the fair value of net assets is estimated based on analyses of our market value  discounted cash flows and peer values 
consequently  the determination of the fair value of goodwill is sensitive to market based economics and other key assumptions 
variability in market conditions or in key assumptions could result in impairment of goodwill  which is recorded as a noncash adjustment to income 
an impairment of goodwill could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as of december   we had goodwill of approximately million  or of our total stockholders equity 
furthermore  an impairment of goodwill could cause our bank to be unable to pay dividends to us 
if our bank is unable to pay dividends to us  our cash flow and liquidity would be reduced 
see below our bank s ability to pay dividends to us is subject to regulatory limitations  which  to the extent we are not able to receive such dividends  may impair our ability to grow  pay dividends  cover operating expenses and meet debt service requirements 

table of contents changes in interest rates could negatively impact our net interest income  may weaken demand for our products and services or harm our results of operations and cash flows 
our earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon net interest income  which is the difference between interest income earned on interest earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control  including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies  particularly the federal reserve 
changes in monetary policy  including changes in interest rates  could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings  but such changes could also adversely affect our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits  the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities  including mortgage servicing rights  our ability to realize gains on the sale of assets and the average duration of our mortgage backed investment securities portfolio 
an increase in interest rates may reduce customers desire to borrow money from us as it increases their borrowing costs and may adversely affect the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans which may lead to an increase in non performing assets and a reduction of income recognized  which could harm our results of operations and cash flows 
further  because many of our variable rate loans contain interest rate floors  as market interest rates begin to rise  the interest rates on these loans may not increase correspondingly 
in contrast  decreasing interest rates have the effect of causing customers to refinance mortgage loans faster than anticipated 
this causes the value of assets related to the servicing rights on mortgage loans sold to be lower than originally recognized 
if this happens  we may need to write down our mortgage servicing rights assets faster  which would accelerate expense and lower our earnings 
any substantial  unexpected or prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
if the current low interest rate environment were to continue for a prolonged period  our interest income could decrease  adversely impacting our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we may not continue to have access to low cost funding sources 
we depend on checking and savings  negotiable order of withdrawal  or now  and money market deposit account balances and other forms of customer deposits as our primary source of funding 
such account and deposit balances can decrease when customers perceive alternative investments  such as the stock market  as providing a better risk return tradeoff 
if customers move money out of bank deposits and into other investments  we could lose a relatively low cost source of funds  increasing our funding costs and reducing our net interest income and net income 
our deposit insurance premiums could be substantially higher in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on our future earnings 
the fdic insures deposits at fdic insured depository institutions  including the bank 
under current fdic regulations  each insured depository institution is subject to a risk based assessment system and  depending on its assigned risk category  is assessed insurance premiums based on average total assets less average tangible equity  with adjustments for brokered deposits  unsecured debt and for custodial banks and banks that primarily provide services to other banks 
the fdic charges insured financial institutions premiums to maintain the depositors insurance fund or dif at a certain level 
bank failures have substantially reduced the dif s reserves 
the fdic has published and amended a restoration plan designed to replenish the dif and to increase the deposit insurance reserve ratio through to implement the restoration plan  the fdic has adopted a series of initiatives that have changed its risk based assessment system  increased its base assessment rates and imposed special assessments 
a change in the risk category assigned to our bank  further adjustments to base assessment rates and additional special assessments could have a material adverse effect on our earnings  financial condition and results of operation 
we may not be able to continue growing our business 
our total assets have grown from billion as of december  to billion as of december  our ability to grow depends  in part  upon our ability to successfully attract deposits  identify favorable loan and investment opportunities  open new branch banking offices and expand into new and complementary markets when appropriate opportunities arise 
in the event we do not continue to grow  our results of operations could be adversely impacted 
our ability to grow successfully depends on our capital resources and whether we can continue to fund growth while maintaining cost controls and asset quality  as well as on other factors beyond our control  such as national and regional economic conditions and interest rate trends 
if we are not able to make loans  attract deposits and maintain asset quality due to constrained capital resources or other reasons  we may not be able to continue growing our business  which could adversely impact our earnings  financial condition  results of operations  and prospects 

table of contents adverse economic conditions affecting montana  wyoming and western south dakota could harm our business 
our customers with loan and or deposit balances are located predominantly in montana  wyoming and western south dakota 
because of the concentration of loans and deposits in these states  existing or future adverse economic conditions in montana  wyoming or western south dakota could cause us to experience higher rates of loss and delinquency on our loans than if the loans were more geographically diversified 
the recent economic recession has adversely affected the real estate and business environment in certain areas in montana and wyoming  especially in markets dependent upon resort communities and second homes such as bozeman  montana  kalispell  montana  and jackson  wyoming 
in the future  adverse economic conditions  including inflation  recession and unemployment and other factors  such as regulatory or business developments  natural disasters  wide spread disease  terrorist activity  environmental contamination and other unfavorable conditions and events that affect these states  could reduce demand for credit or fee based products and may delay or prevent borrowers from repaying their loans 
adverse conditions and other factors identified above could also negatively affect real estate and other collateral values  interest rate levels and the availability of credit to refinance loans at or prior to maturity 
these results could adversely impact our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
we are subject to significant governmental regulation and new or changes in existing regulatory  tax and accounting rules and interpretations could significantly harm our business 
the financial services industry is extensively regulated 
federal and state banking regulations are designed primarily to protect the deposit insurance funds and consumers  not to benefit a financial company s stockholders 
these regulations may impose significant limitations on operations 
the significant federal and state banking regulations that affect us are described in this report under the heading regulation and supervision 
these regulations  along with the currently existing tax  accounting  securities  insurance  employment  monetary and other laws and regulations  rules  standards  policies and interpretations control the methods by which we conduct business  implement strategic initiatives and tax compliance and govern financial reporting and disclosures 
these laws  regulations  rules  standards  policies and interpretations are undergoing significant review and changes  particularly given the recent market developments in the banking and financial services industries and the recent enactment of the dodd frank act 
recent events have resulted in legislators  regulators and authoritative bodies  such as the financial accounting standards board  the securities and exchange commission  or sec  the public company accounting oversight board and various taxing authorities responding by adopting and or proposing substantive revisions to laws  regulations  rules  standards  policies and interpretations 
further  federal monetary policy as implemented through the federal reserve can significantly affect credit conditions in our markets 
the nature  extent and timing of the adoption of significant new laws  regulations  rules  standards  policies and interpretations  or changes in or repeal of these items or specific actions of regulators  may increase our costs of compliance and harm our business 
for example  potential increases in or other modifications affecting regulatory capital thresholds could impact our status as well capitalized 
we may not be able to predict accurately the extent of any impact from changes in existing laws  regulations  rules  standards  policies and interpretations 
the dodd frank act will result in sweeping changes in the regulation of financial institutions and could significantly harm our business 
on july   the dodd frank act was signed into law 
the dodd frank act will result in sweeping changes in the regulation of financial institutions 
the dodd frank act contains numerous provisions that will affect all banks and bank holding companies 
many of these and other provisions in the dodd frank act remain subject to regulatory rule making and implementation  the effects of which are not yet known including provisions that  among other things centralize responsibility for promulgating regulations under and enforcing federal consumer financial protection laws in a new bureau of consumer financial protection that will have direct supervision and examination authority over banks with more than billion in assets  require the fdic to seek to make its capital requirements for banks countercyclical  impose comprehensive regulation of the over the counter derivatives market  which would include certain provisions that would effectively prohibit insured depository institutions from conducting certain derivatives businesses in the institution itself  implement corporate governance revisions  including with regard to executive compensation and proxy access by shareholders  establish new rules and restrictions regarding the origination of mortgages  and permit the federal reserve to prescribe regulations regarding interchange transaction fees  and limit them to an amount reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer for the transaction in question 

table of contents although we cannot predict the specific impact and long term effects that the dodd frank act will have on us and the financial industry in general  we believe the dodd frank act and the regulations promulgated thereunder will result in additional administrative burdens that will obligate us to incur additional costs and expenses 
provisions of the act that affect deposit insurance assessments  payment of interest on demand deposits and interchange fees could increase the costs associated with deposits as well as place limitations on certain revenues those deposits may generate 
although the treatment of our existing trust preferred securities as tier capital will be grandfathered under the act  provisions of the act that revoke tier capital treatments of trust preferred securities and otherwise require revisions to capital requirements may cause us to seek other sources of capital in the future 
furthermore  the dodd frank act could limit the types of financial services and products we may offer  increase the ability of non banks to offer competing financial services and products  reduce interchange fees  require us to renegotiate payment network agreements or enter into multiple payment network agreements  require a significant amount of management s time and attention  and otherwise adversely impact our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
non compliance with laws and regulations could result in fines  sanctions and other enforcement actions and the loss of our financial holding company status 
federal and state regulators have broad enforcement powers 
if we fail to comply with any laws  regulations  rules  standards  policies or interpretations applicable to us  we could face various sanctions and enforcement actions  which include the appointment of a conservator or receiver for us  the issuance of a cease and desist order that can be judicially enforced  the termination of our deposit insurance  the imposition of civil monetary fines and penalties  the issuance of directives to increase capital  the issuance of formal and informal agreements  the issuance of removal and prohibition orders against officers  directors and other institution affiliated parties  and the enforcement of such actions through injunctions or restraining orders the imposition of any such sanctions or other enforcement actions could adversely impact our earnings  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
furthermore  as a financial holding company  we may engage in authorized financial activities provided we are in compliance with applicable regulatory standards and guidelines 
if we fail to meet such standards and guidelines  we may be required to cease certain financial holding company activities and  in certain circumstances  to divest the bank 
the effects of recent legislative and regulatory efforts are uncertain 
in response to market disruptions  legislators and financial regulators implemented a number of initiatives designed to stabilize and improve the financial markets  including direct and indirect assistance to distressed financial institutions and the provision of assistance by the banking authorities in arranging acquisitions of weakened banks and broker dealers  legislation that provided economic stimulus funding and liquidity to the financial markets  including the troubled asset relief program capital purchase program  programs by the federal reserve to provide liquidity to the commercial paper markets  stimulus to increase commercial and consumer based lending  and successive rounds of quantitative easing  proposed guidance by the federal reserve on incentive compensation policies at banking organizations  proposals and recent judicial decisions limiting a lender s ability to foreclose on mortgages or make such foreclosures less economically viable  including by allowing chapter bankruptcy plans to cram down the value of certain mortgages on a consumer s principal residence to its market value and or reset interest rates and monthly payments to permit defaulting debtors to remain in their home  acceleration of the effective date of various provisions of the credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of  which restrict certain credit and charge card practices  require expanded disclosures to consumers and provide consumers with the right to opt out of interest rate increases with limited exceptions  adoption of new rules by the federal reserve under regulation e  effective july  for new accounts and august  for existing accounts  generally prohibiting financial institutions from charging overdraft fees for atm and one time debit card transactions that overdraw consumer deposit accounts  unless the consumer opts in to having such overdrafts authorized and paid  and enactment of the dodd frank act 

table of contents these initiatives may increase our expenses or decrease our income by  among other things  making it harder for us to foreclose on mortgages and impacting the amount of overdraft fees we will be able to charge 
further  the overall effects of these and other legislative and regulatory efforts on the financial markets remain uncertain and they may not have the intended results 
these efforts may even have unintended harmful consequences on the us financial system and our business 
should these or other legislative or regulatory initiatives have unintended effects  our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  we may need to modify our strategies and business operations in response to these changes 
we may also incur increased capital requirements and constraints or additional costs in order to satisfy new regulatory requirements 
given the volatile nature of the current market and the uncertainties underlying efforts to mitigate or reverse disruptions  we may not timely anticipate or manage existing  new or additional risks  contingencies or developments in the current or future environment 
our failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
we are dependent upon the services of our management team and directors 
our future success and profitability is substantially dependent upon the management skills of our executive officers and directors  many of whom have held officer and director positions with us for many years 
we do not currently have employment agreements or non competition agreements with any of our key executives 
the unanticipated loss or unavailability of key employees could harm our ability to operate our business or execute our business strategy 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in retaining these key employees or finding and integrating suitable successors in the event of their loss or unavailability 
we may not be able to attract and retain qualified employees to operate our business effectively 
there is substantial competition for qualified personnel in our markets 
although unemployment rates have been declining in montana and wyoming  and the surrounding region  it may still be difficult to attract and retain qualified employees at all management and staffing levels 
failure to attract and retain employees and maintain adequate staffing of qualified personnel could adversely impact our operations and our ability to execute our business strategy 
furthermore  relatively low unemployment rates in certain of our markets  compared with national unemployment rates  may lead to significant increases in salaries  wages and employee benefits expenses as we compete for qualified  skilled employees  which could negatively impact our results of operations and prospects 
a failure of the technology we use could harm our business and our information systems may experience a breach in security 
we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business and we depend heavily upon data processing  software  communication and information exchange from a number of vendors on a variety of computing platforms and networks and over the internet 
we cannot be certain that all of our systems are entirely free from vulnerability to breaches of security or other technological difficulties or failures 
a breach in the security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management  general ledger  deposit  loan  investment  credit card and other information systems 
a breach of the security of our information systems could damage our reputation  result in a loss of customer business  subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability 
furthermore  the computer systems and network infrastructure we use could be vulnerable to other unforeseen problems  such as damage from fire  privacy loss  telecommunications failure or other similar events which would also have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
our operations rely on certain external vendors 
we are reliant upon certain external vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain our day to day operations 
in addition  we are subject to certain long term vendor contracts that limit our flexibility and increase our dependence on third party vendors 
failure of certain external vendors to perform in accordance with contractual arrangements could be disruptive to our operations and limit our ability to provide certain products and services demanded by our customers  which could have material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
table of contents we are subject to liquidity risks 
liquidity is the ability to meet current and future cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost 
our liquidity is used to make loans and to repay deposit liabilities as they become due or are demanded by customers 
potential alternative sources of liquidity include federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements 
we maintain a portfolio of investment securities that may be used as a secondary source of liquidity to the extent the securities are not pledged for collateral 
other potential sources of liquidity include the sale of loans  the utilization of available government and regulatory assistance programs  the ability to acquire national market  non core deposits  the issuance of additional collateralized borrowings such as federal home loan bank  or fhlb  advances  the issuance of debt securities  issuance of equity securities and borrowings through the federal reserve s discount window 
without sufficient liquidity from these potential sources  we may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors and borrowers 
additionally  our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors specific to us  the financial services industry or the economy in general 
factors that could reduce our access to liquidity sources include a downturn in our local or national economies  difficult or illiquid credit markets or adverse regulatory actions against us 
a failure to maintain adequate liquidity could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations we may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates 
although our growth strategy is to primarily focus and promote organic growth  we also have in the past and intend in the future to complement and expand our business by pursuing strategic acquisitions of banks and other financial institutions 
we believe  however  there are a limited number of banks that will meet our acquisition criteria and  consequently  we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify suitable candidates for acquisitions 
in addition  even if suitable candidates are identified  we expect to compete with other potential bidders for such businesses  many of which may have greater financial resources than we have 
our failure to find suitable acquisition candidates  or successfully bid against other competitors for acquisitions  could adversely affect our ability to successfully implement our business strategy 
we may be unable to manage our growth due to acquisitions  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
acquisitions of other banks and financial institutions involve risks of changes in results of operations or cash flows  unforeseen liabilities relating to the acquired institution or arising out of the acquisition  asset quality problems of the acquired entity and other conditions not within our control  such as adverse personnel relations  loss of customers because of change of identity  deterioration in local economic conditions and other risks affecting the acquired institution 
in addition  the process of integrating acquired entities will divert significant management time and resources 
we may not be able to integrate successfully or operate profitably any financial institutions we may acquire 
we may experience disruption and incur unexpected expenses in integrating acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that any such acquisitions will enhance our cash flows  business  financial condition  results of operations or prospects and such acquisitions may have an adverse effect on our results of operations  particularly during periods in which the acquisitions are being integrated into our operations 
we face significant competition from other financial institutions and financial services providers 
we face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of different competitors  many of which are larger and may have more financial resources  higher lending limits and large branch networks 
such competitors primarily include national  regional and community banks within the various markets we serve 
we also face competition from many other types of financial institutions  including  without limitation  savings and loans  credit unions  finance companies  brokerage firms  insurance companies  factoring companies and other financial intermediaries 
the financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative  regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation 
banks  securities firms and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company  which can offer virtually any type of financial service  including banking  securities underwriting  insurance both agency and underwriting and merchant banking 
increased competition among financial services companies due to the recent consolidation of certain competing financial institutions and the conversion of certain investment banks to bank holding companies may adversely affect our ability to market our products and services 
also  technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks  such as automatic funds transfer and automatic payment systems 
many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures 
additionally  due to their size  many competitors may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than we can 

table of contents our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors  including  among other things the ability to develop  maintain and build upon long term customer relationships based on quality service  high ethical standards and safe  sound assets  the ability to expand our market position  the scope  relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands  the rate at which we introduce new products and services relative to our competitors  customer satisfaction with our level of service  and industry and general economic trends 
failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position  which could adversely affect our growth and profitability  which  in turn  could harm our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
we may not be able to manage risks inherent in our business  particularly given the recent turbulent and dynamic market conditions 
a comprehensive and well integrated risk management function is essential for our business 
we have adopted various policies  procedures and systems to monitor and manage risk and are currently implementing a centralized risk oversight function 
these policies  procedures and systems may be inadequate to identify and mitigate all risks inherent in our business 
in addition  our business and the markets and industry in which we operate are continuously evolving 
we may fail to understand fully the implications of changes in our business or the financial markets and fail to adequately or timely enhance our risk framework to address those changes  particularly given the recent turbulent and dynamic market conditions 
if our risk framework is ineffective  either because it fails to keep pace with changes in the financial markets or in our business or for other reasons  we could incur losses and otherwise experience harm to our business 
our systems of internal operating controls may not be effective 
we establish and maintain systems of internal operational controls that provide us with critical information used to manage our business 
these systems are subject to various inherent limitations  including cost  judgments used in decision making  assumptions about the likelihood of future events  the soundness of our systems  the possibility of human error and the risk of fraud 
moreover  controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and the risk that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate over time 
because of these limitations  any system of internal operating controls may not be successful in preventing all errors or fraud or in making all material information known in a timely manner to the appropriate levels of management 
from time to time  control deficiencies and losses from operational malfunctions or fraud have occurred and may occur in the future 
any future deficiencies  weaknesses or losses related to internal operating control systems could have an adverse effect on our business and  in turn  on our financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
we may become liable for environmental remediation and other costs on repossessed properties  which could adversely impact our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
a significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property 
during the ordinary course of business  we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans 
if hazardous or toxic substances are found on these properties  we may be liable for remediation costs  as well as for personal injury and property damage 
environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property 
in addition  future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability 
the remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to claims and litigation pertaining to our fiduciary responsibilities 
some of the services we provide  such as trust and investment services  require us to act as fiduciaries for our customers and others 
from time to time  third parties make claims and take legal action against us pertaining to the performance of our fiduciary responsibilities 
if these claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to us  we may be exposed to significant financial liability and or our reputation could be damaged 
either of these results may adversely impact demand for our products and services or otherwise have a harmful effect on our business and  in turn  on our financial condition  results of operations and prospects 

table of contents we may not effectively implement new technology driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers 
the financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services 
the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs 
our future success depends  in part  upon our ability to use technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands  as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations 
many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements 
we may not be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers 
failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business and  in turn  on our financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
the federal reserve may require us to commit capital resources to support our bank subsidiary 
as a matter of policy  the federal reserve  which examines us and our subsidiaries  expects a bank holding company to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to a subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support such subsidiary bank 
under the source of strength doctrine  the federal reserve may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank and may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank 
a capital injection may be required at times when the holding company may not have the resources to provide it and therefore may be required to borrow the funds 
any loans by a holding company to its subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank 
in the event of a bank holding company s bankruptcy  the bankruptcy trustee will assume any commitment by the holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank 
moreover  bankruptcy law provides that claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of the institution s general unsecured creditors  including the holders of its note obligations 
thus  any borrowing that must be done by the holding company in order to make the required capital injection becomes more difficult and expensive and will adversely impact the holding company s cash flows  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
we may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions 
the financial services industry as a whole  as well as the securities markets generally  have been materially and adversely affected by significant declines in the values of nearly all asset classes and a serious lack of liquidity 
if other financial institutions in our markets dispose of real estate collateral at below market prices to meet liquidity or regulatory requirements  such actions could negatively impact overall real estate values  including properties securing our loans 
our credit risk is exacerbated when the collateral we hold cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit exposure due to us 
any such losses could harm our financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
financial institutions in particular have been subject to increased volatility and an overall loss of investor confidence 
our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions 
financial services companies are interrelated as a result of trading  clearing  counterparty or other relationships 
we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties 
for example  we execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry  including brokers and dealers  commercial banks  investment banks and other institutional clients 
as a result  defaults by  or even rumors or questions about  one or more financial services companies or the financial services industry generally  have led to market wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions 
many of these transactions expose us to increased credit risk in the event of default of a counterparty or client 
the short term and long term impact of the new basel iii capital standards and the forthcoming new capital rules to be proposed for us banks is uncertain 
on december   the basel committee on banking supervision  or basel committee  released the final text of its reforms to strengthen global capital and liquidity rules designed to create a more resilient banking industry 
these reforms  known as basel iii  are intended to strengthen the regulatory capital framework by  among other things  raising the quality  consistency and transparency of an institution s capital base  reducing procyclicality and promoting counter cyclical buffers  enhancing risk coverage  supplementing the risk based capital requirement with a leverage ratio  and introducing a global liquidity standard 

table of contents on january   the basel committee issued additional criteria to basel iii 
this criteria provides that for instruments issued by a bank to be included in tier or tier capital  they must meet or exceed minimum requirements designed to require such instruments to fully absorb losses before taxpayers are exposed to loss 
basel iii  as supplemented  has been adopted by the federal reserve and implementation will start on january  regulations will be amended and implemented prior to that date 
from january  on  banks will have to meet certain minimum capital requirements for share capital  tier capital  and total capital 
because the regulations are still to be implemented  the short term and long term impact of the basel iii capital standards and the forthcoming new capital rules to be proposed for us banks is uncertain 
our bank s ability to pay dividends to us is subject to regulatory limitations  which  to the extent we are not able to receive such dividends  may impair our ability to grow  pay dividends  cover operating expenses and meet debt service requirements 
we are a legal entity separate and distinct from the bank  our only bank subsidiary 
since we are a holding company with no significant assets other than the capital stock of our subsidiaries  we depend upon dividends from the bank for a substantial part of our revenue 
accordingly  our ability to grow  pay dividends  cover operating expenses and meet debt service requirements depends primarily upon the receipt of dividends or other capital distributions from the bank 
the bank s ability to pay dividends to us is subject to  among other things  its earnings  financial condition and need for funds  as well as federal and state governmental policies and regulations applicable to us and the bank  which limit the amount that may be paid as dividends without prior approval 
for example  in general  the bank is limited to paying dividends that do not exceed the current year net profits together with retained earnings from the two preceding calendar years unless the prior consents of the montana and federal banking regulators are obtained 
furthermore  the terms of our series a preferred stock  of which  shares were outstanding as of december   prohibit us from declaring or paying dividends or distributions on any class of our common stock  unless all accrued and unpaid dividends for the three prior consecutive dividend periods have been paid 
any reduction or elimination of our common stock dividend in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
new lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risks 
from time to time  we may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business 
there are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts  particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed 
in developing and marketing new lines of business and or new products and services we may invest significant time and resources 
initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible 
external factors  such as compliance with regulations  competitive alternatives  and shifting market preferences  may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service 
furthermore  any new line of business and or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of the our system of internal controls 
failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
concerns regarding the downgrade of the us credit rating could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and liquidity 
standard poor s downgrade of the us government s sovereign credit rating and of the credit ratings of instruments issued  insured or guaranteed by certain related institutions  agencies and instrumentalities could result in risks to us and general economic conditions that we are not able to predict 
on august   standard poor s downgraded the united states long term debt rating from aaa to aa 
on august   standard poor s downgraded the credit ratings of certain long term debt instruments issued by fannie mae and freddie mac and other us government agencies linked to long term us debt 
these downgrades could adversely affect the market value of certain of instruments that we hold  and could adversely impact our ability to obtain funding that is collateralized by affected instruments  as well as affecting the pricing of that funding when it is available 
we cannot predict if  when or how these changes to the credit ratings will affect economic conditions 
this ratings downgrade could result in a significant adverse impact to us  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and liquidity 
because of the unprecedented nature of negative credit rating actions with respect to us government obligations  the ultimate impact on our business  financial condition and liquidity are unpredictable and may not be immediately apparent 

table of contents risks relating to our class a common stock our dividend policy may change 
although we have historically paid dividends to our stockholders  we have no obligation to continue doing so and may change our dividend policy at any time without notice to our stockholders 
holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such cash dividends as our board may declare out of funds legally available for such payments 
furthermore  consistent with our strategic plans  growth initiatives  capital availability  projected liquidity needs and other factors  we have made and adopted and will continue to make and adopt  capital management decisions and policies that could adversely impact the amount of dividends paid to our stockholders 
the trading volume in our class a common stock has been limited  and an active trading market may not develop 
our class a common stock is currently traded on the nasdaq global select market 
our class a common stock is thinly traded and has substantially less liquidity than the average trading market for many other publicly traded financial institutions and other companies 
therefore  investors have limited opportunities to sell their shares of class a common stock in the open market 
limited trading of our class a common stock also contributes to more volatile price fluctuations 
an active trading market for our class a common stock may never develop or be sustained  which could affect your ability to sell your shares and could depress the market price of your shares 
approximately of our outstanding common stock is owned by members of the scott family  our executive officers and our directors 
the substantial amount of stock owned by these individuals may adversely affect the development of an active and liquid trading market 
our class a common stock share price could be volatile and could decline 
the market price of our class a common stock is volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors  some of which are beyond our control 
these factors include prevailing market conditions  our historical performance and capital structure  estimates of our business potential and earnings prospects  an overall assessment of our management  and the consideration of these factors in relation to market valuation of companies in related businesses 
at times the stock markets  including the nasdaq stock market  on which our class a common stock is listed  may experience significant price and volume fluctuations 
as a result  the market price of our class a common stock is likely to be similarly volatile and investors in our class a common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares  including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects 
in addition  in the past  following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies 
this litigation  if instituted against us  could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources 
holders of the class b common stock have voting control of our company and are able to determine virtually all matters submitted to stockholders  including potential change in control transactions 
members of the scott family control in excess of of the voting power of our outstanding common stock 
due to their holdings of common stock  members of the scott family are able to determine the outcome of virtually all matters submitted to stockholders for approval  including the election of directors  amendment of our articles of incorporation except when a class vote is required by law  any merger or consolidation requiring common stockholder approval and the sale of all or substantially all of the company s assets 
accordingly  such holders have the ability to prevent change in control transactions as long as they maintain voting control of the company 
in addition  because these holders will have the ability to elect all of our directors they will be able to control our policies and operations  including the appointment of management  future issuances of our common stock or other securities  the payments of dividends on our common stock and entering into extraordinary transactions  and their interests may not in all cases be aligned with your interests 
further  because of our dual class structure  members of the scott family will continue to be able to control all matters submitted to our stockholder for approval even if they come to own less than of the total outstanding shares of our common stock 
the scott family members have entered into a stockholder agreement giving family 
table of contents members a right of first refusal to purchase shares of class b common stock that are intended to be sold or transferred  subject to certain exceptions  by other family members 
this agreement may have the effect of continuing ownership of the class b common stock and control within the scott family 
this concentrated control will limit your ability to influence corporate matters 
as a result  the market price of our class a common stock could be adversely affected 
future equity issuances could result in dilution  which could cause our class a common stock price to decline 
we are not restricted from issuing additional class a common stock  including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for  or that represent the right to receive  class a common stock 
we may issue additional class a common stock in the future pursuant to current or future employee stock option plans or in connection with future acquisitions or financings 
should we choose to raise capital by selling shares of class a common stock for any reason  the issuance would have a dilutive effect on the holders of our class a common stock and could have a material negative effect on the market price of our class a common stock 
an investment in our class a common stock is not an insured deposit 
our class a common stock is not a bank savings account or deposit and  therefore  is not insured against loss by the fdic  any other deposit insurance fund or any other public or private entity 
as a result  holders of our common stock could lose some or all of their investment 
anti takeover provisions and the regulations to which we are subject also may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us  even if the change in control would be beneficial to stockholders 
we are a financial and bank holding company incorporated in the state of montana 
anti takeover provisions in montana law and our articles of incorporation and bylaws  as well as regulatory approvals that would be required under federal law  could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us and may prevent stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares of our class a common stock 
these provisions could adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock and could reduce the amount that stockholders might receive if we are sold 
our articles of incorporation provide that our board of directors  or board  may issue up to  additional shares of preferred stock  in one or more series  without stockholder approval and with such terms  conditions  rights  privileges and preferences as the board may deem appropriate 
in addition  our articles of incorporation provide for staggered terms for our board and limitations on persons authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders 
in addition  certain provisions of montana law may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making a proposal to acquire us or of impeding a change of control under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of our class a common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price of such class a common stock 
further  the acquisition of specified amounts of our common stock in some cases  the acquisition or control of more than of our voting stock may require certain regulatory approvals  including the approval of the federal reserve and one or more of our state banking regulatory agencies 
the filing of applications with these agencies and the accompanying review process can take several months 
additionally  as discussed above  the holders of the class b common stock will have voting control of our company 
this and the other factors described above may hinder or even prevent a change in control of us  even if a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders 
we qualify as a controlled company under the nasdaq marketplace rules and may rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements 
as a result of the combined voting power of the members of the scott family described above  we qualify as a controlled company under the nasdaq marketplace rules 
as a controlled company  we may rely on exemptions from certain nasdaq corporate governance standards that are available to controlled companies  including the requirements that a majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors  the compensation of officers be determined  or recommended to the board of directors for determination  by a majority of the independent directors or a compensation committee comprised solely of independent directors  and director nominees be selected  or recommended for the board of directors selection  by a majority of the independent directors or a nominating committee comprised solely of independent directors with a written charter or board resolution addressing the nomination process 

table of contents as a result  in the future  our compensation and governance nominating committees may not consist entirely of independent directors 
as long as we choose to rely on these exemptions from nasdaq marketplace rules in the future  you will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the nasdaq corporate governance requirements 
the class a common stock is equity and is subordinate to our existing and future indebtedness and to our series a preferred stock 
shares of our class a common stock are equity interests and do not constitute indebtedness 
as such  shares of our class a common stock rank junior to all our indebtedness  including our subordinated term loans  the subordinated debentures held by trusts that have issued trust preferred securities and other non equity claims on us with respect to assets available to satisfy claims on us 
additionally  holders of our class a common stock are subject to the prior dividend and liquidation rights of any holders of our series a preferred stock then outstanding 
in the future  we may attempt to increase our capital resources or  if our bank s capital ratios fall below the required minimums  we or the bank could be forced to raise additional capital by making additional offerings of debt or equity securities  including medium term notes  trust preferred securities  senior or subordinated notes and preferred stock 
or  we may issue additional debt or equity securities as consideration for future mergers and acquisitions 
such additional debt and equity offerings may place restrictions on our ability to pay dividends on or repurchase our common stock  dilute the holdings of our existing stockholders or reduce the market price of our class a common stock 
furthermore  acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values and therefore  some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common stock may occur in connection with any future transaction 
holders of our class a common stock are not entitled to preemptive rights or other protections against dilution

table of contents recent developments on july   the board of governors of the federal reserve system  or frb  and the federal deposit insurance corporation  or fdic  issued separate final rules to implement the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act  or dodd frank act  which mandated repeal of the prohibition against paying interest on demand deposits  thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts beginning july  this change did not have a significant impact on our interest expense  consolidated financial statements  results of operations or liquidity in on june   the frb issued a final rule establishing standards for debit card interchange fees and prohibiting network exclusivity arrangements and routing restrictions 
this rule  regulation ii debit card interchange fees and routing  implements provisions of the dodd frank act 
the rule  which became effective october   reduces the maximum allowable interchange fee per transaction for issuers with over billion in assets 
issuers with less than billion in assets  like us  are exempt from the debit card interchange fee limitations 
under this exemption  we do not anticipate any immediate  significant impact to interchange revenues 
we recorded debit card interchange fees of million during in february  the fdic issued a final rule that  among other things  modified the definition of an institution s deposit insurance assessment base and revised assessment rate schedules 
the final rule changes the deposit insurance assessment base to an institution s average total assets less its average tangible equity  with adjustments for brokered deposits  unsecured debt and for custodial banks and banks that primarily provide services to other banks 
these changes  which became effective april   resulted in a reduction in our fdic insurance premiums

loan charge offs  net of recoveries  totaled million during  as compared to million during during fourth quarter  net charge offs peaked at million for the three month period 
net charge offs are expected to remain high in future quarters as problem loans continue to work through the credit cycle  but not at the elevated level experienced during fourth quarter although economic conditions remained challenging during  there were some tangible signs that economic recovery is underway in many of our market areas 
unemployment rates in montana  wyoming and south dakota continue to compare favorably to national averages and decreased in  as compared to the table below presents average seasonally adjusted unemployment rates in the three states in which we operate and nationally for the periods indicated

our criticized loans decreased during  ending the year at million  a million  or  decrease from million as of december  based on our assessment of the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses  we recorded provisions for loan losses of million during  compared to million during management expects provisions for loan losses to continue to decline as credit quality improves 

table of contents goodwill our annual goodwill impairment test is performed each year as of july st 
upon completion of this year s test  the estimated fair value of net assets was greater than carrying value of the company 
during the last half of  there was a significant and prolonged decrease in market prices for bank stocks  including our common stock 
as a result  we determined that an interim impairment test was warranted 
we engaged a third party valuation consultant to assist us in our determination of the fair value of goodwill as of december  based upon this valuation  we determined that the fair value of our net assets was greater than the carrying value of the company as of december  and no impairment existed 
we will continue to monitor our performance and evaluate our goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently as needed 
primary factors used in evaluating our business as a banking institution  we manage and evaluate various aspects of both our financial condition and our results of operations 
we monitor our financial condition and performance on a monthly basis  at our holding company  at the bank and at each banking office 
we evaluate the levels and trends of the line items included in our balance sheet and statements of income  as well as various financial ratios that are commonly used in our industry 
we analyze these ratios and financial trends against both our own historical levels and the financial condition and performance of comparable banking institutions in our region and nationally 
results of operations principal factors used in managing and evaluating our results of operations include return on average assets  net interest income  non interest income  non interest expense and net income 
net interest income is affected by the level of interest rates  changes in interest rates and changes in the composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the most significant impact on our net interest income between periods is derived from the interaction of changes in the rates earned or paid on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  which we refer to as interest rate spread 
the volume of loans  investment securities and other interest earning assets  compared to the volume of interest bearing deposits and indebtedness  combined with the interest rate spread  produces changes in our net interest income between periods 
non interest bearing sources of funds  such as demand deposits and stockholders equity  also support earning assets 
the impact of free funding sources is captured in the net interest margin  which is calculated as net interest income divided by average earning assets 
given the interest free nature of free funding sources  the net interest margin is generally higher than the interest rate spread 
we seek to increase our net interest income over time and evaluate our net interest income on factors that include the yields on our loans and other earning assets  the costs of our deposits and other funding sources  the levels of our net interest spread and net interest margin and the provisions for loan losses required to maintain our allowance for loan losses at an adequate level 
we seek to increase our non interest income over time and we evaluate our non interest income relative to the trends of the individual types of non interest income in view of prevailing market conditions 
we seek to manage our non interest expenses in consideration of the growth of our business and our community banking model that emphasizes customer service and responsiveness 
we evaluate our non interest expense on factors that include our non interest expense relative to our average assets  our efficiency ratio and the trends of the individual categories of non interest expense 
finally  we seek to increase our net income and provide favorable shareholder returns over time  and we evaluate our net income relative to the performance of other banks and bank holding companies on factors that include return on average assets  return on average equity  and consistency and rates of growth in our earnings 
financial condition principal areas of focus in managing and evaluating our financial condition include liquidity  the diversification and quality of our loans  the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses  the diversification and terms of our deposits and other funding sources  the re pricing characteristics and maturities of our assets and liabilities  including potential interest rate exposure and the adequacy of our capital levels 
we seek to maintain sufficient levels of cash and investment securities to meet potential payment and funding obligations  and we evaluate our liquidity on factors that include the levels of cash and highly liquid assets relative to our liabilities  the quality and maturities of our investment securities  the ratio of loans to deposits and any reliance on brokered certificates of deposit or other wholesale funding sources 

table of contents we seek to maintain a diverse and high quality loan portfolio and evaluate our asset quality on factors that include the allocation of our loans among loan types  credit exposure to any single borrower or industry type  non performing assets as a percentage of total loans and oreo  and loan charge offs as a percentage of average loans 
we seek to maintain our allowance for loan losses at a level adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio at each balance sheet date  and we evaluate the level of our allowance for loan losses relative to our overall loan portfolio and the level of non performing loans and potential charge offs 
we seek to fund our assets primarily using core customer deposits spread among various deposit categories  and we evaluate our deposit and funding mix on factors that include the allocation of our deposits among deposit types  the level of our non interest bearing deposits  the ratio of our core deposits ie excluding time deposits above  to our total deposits and our reliance on brokered deposits or other wholesale funding sources  such as borrowings from other banks or agencies 
we seek to manage the mix  maturities and re pricing characteristics of our assets and liabilities to maintain relative stability of our net interest rate margin in a changing interest rate environment  and we evaluate our asset liability management using complex models to evaluate the changes to our net interest income under different interest rate scenarios 
finally  we seek to maintain adequate capital levels to absorb unforeseen operating losses and to help support the growth of our balance sheet 
we evaluate our capital adequacy using the regulatory and financial capital ratios including leverage capital ratio  tier risk based capital ratio  total risk based capital ratio  tangible common equity to tangible assets and tier common capital to total risk weighted assets 
critical accounting estimates and significant accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and follow general practices within the industries in which we operate 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in notes to consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting policies included in financial statements included part iv  item of this report 
our critical accounting estimates are summarized below 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if the accounting estimate requires management to make particularly difficult  subjective and or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  or the use of different estimates that management could have reasonably used in the current period  would have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements  results of operations or liquidity 
allowance for loan losses the provision for loan losses creates an allowance for loan losses known and inherent in the loan portfolio at each balance sheet date 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
we perform a quarterly assessment of the risks inherent in our loan portfolio  as well as a detailed review of each significant loan with identified weaknesses 
based on this analysis  we record a provision for loan losses in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at appropriate levels 
in determining the allowance for loan losses  we estimate losses on specific loans  or groups of loans  where the probable loss can be identified and reasonably determined 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of subjective measurements  including management s assessment of the internal risk classifications of loans  historical loan loss rates  changes in the nature of the loan portfolio  overall portfolio quality  industry concentrations  delinquency trends and the impact of current local  regional and national economic factors on the quality of the loan portfolio 
changes in these estimates and assumptions are possible and may have a material impact on our allowance  and therefore our consolidated financial statements or results of operations 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at an amount we believe is sufficient to provide for estimated losses inherent in our loan portfolio at each balance sheet date  and fluctuations in the provision for loan losses result from management s assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
management monitors qualitative and quantitative trends in the loan portfolio  including changes in the levels of past due  internally classified and non performing loans 
see notes to consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting policies for a description of the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan losses 
a discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for loan losses is included herein under the heading financial condition allowance for loan losses

table of contents goodwill the excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets from acquisitions  or goodwill  is evaluated for impairment at least annually and on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates that it is likely impairment has occurred 
in testing for impairment  the fair value of net assets is estimated based on an analysis of our market value  discounted cash flows and peer values 
determining the fair value of goodwill is considered a critical accounting estimate because of its sensitivity to market based economics 
in addition  any allocation of the fair value of goodwill to assets and liabilities requires significant management judgment and the use of subjective measurements 
variability in market conditions and key assumptions or subjective measurements used to estimate and allocate fair value are reasonably possible and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or results of operations

other real estate owned real estate acquired in satisfaction of loans is initially carried at current fair value less estimated selling costs 
any excess of loan carrying value over the fair value of the real estate acquired is recorded as a charge to the allowance for loan losses 
subsequent declines in fair value less estimated selling costs are included in oreo expense 
subsequent increases in fair value less estimated selling costs are recorded as a reduction in oreo expense to the extent of recognized losses 
determining the fair value of oreo is considered a critical accounting estimate due to the assets sensitivity to changes in estimates and assumptions used 
changes in these estimates and assumptions are reasonably possible and may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements  liquidity or results of operations

results of operations the following discussion of our results of operations compares the years ended december  to december  and the years ended december  to december  net interest income net interest income  the largest source of our operating income  is derived from interest  dividends and fees received on interest earning assets  less interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities 
interest earning assets primarily include loans and investment securities 
interest bearing liabilities include deposits and various forms of indebtedness 
net interest income is affected by the level of interest rates  changes in interest rates and changes in the composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the most significant impact on our net interest income between periods is derived from the interaction of changes in the volume of and rates earned or paid on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the volume of loans  investment securities and other interest earning assets  compared to the volume of interest bearing deposits and indebtedness  combined with the interest rate spread  produces changes in the net interest income between periods

table of contents provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses creates an allowance for loan losses known and inherent in the loan portfolio at each balance sheet date 
we perform a quarterly assessment of the risks inherent in our loan portfolio  as well as a detailed review of each significant loan with identified weaknesses 
based on this analysis  we record a provision for loan losses in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at appropriate levels 
in determining the allowance for loan losses  we estimate losses on specific loans  or groups of loans  where the probable loss can be identified and reasonably determined 
the balance of the allowance for loan losses is based on internally assigned risk classifications of loans  historical loan loss rates  changes in the nature of the loan portfolio  overall portfolio quality  industry concentrations  delinquency trends  current economic factors and the estimated impact of current economic conditions on certain historical loan loss rates 
fluctuations in the provision for loan losses result from management s assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
ultimate loan losses may vary from current estimates 
for additional information concerning the provision for loan losses  see critical accounting estimates and significant accounting policies included herein 
our provision for loan losses decreased million  or  to million in  as compared to million in  and increased million  or  to million in  as compared to million in fluctuations in the provision for loan losses reflect management s estimate of possible loan loss based upon evaluation of the borrowers ability to repay  collateral underlying loans  loan loss trends and estimated effects of current economic conditions on our loan portfolio 
the level of provision for loan losses in is reflective of decreases in the level of criticized loans and overall loan volume in  as compared to the increase in provision for loan losses in  as compared to  was reflective of increases in criticized loans and weakening economic conditions both nationally and in our market areas 
weak economic conditions particularly affected the performance of many of our land development credit relationships  especially in market areas with economies dependent upon resort and second home communities 
for additional information concerning non performing assets  see financial condition non performing assets herein 
non interest income our principal sources of non interest income include other service charges  commissions and fees  income from the origination and sale of loans  service charges on deposit accounts  and wealth management revenues 
non interest income increased thousand  or  to million in  from million in non interest income decreased million  or  to million in  from million in significant components of these fluctuations are discussed below 
other service charges  commissions and fees primarily include debit and credit card interchange income  mortgage servicing fees  insurance and other commissions and atm service charge revenues 
other service charges  commissions and fees increased million  or  to million in  from million in  primarily due to increases in debit and credit card interchange income resulting from higher transaction volumes 
other service charges  commission and fees increased thousand  or  to million in  from million in  primarily due to higher debit card interchange income resulting from increased volumes of debit card transactions 
on june   the frb issued a final rule that  among other things  reduces the maximum allowable interchange fee per transaction for issuers with over billion in assets 
issuers with less than billion in assets  like us  are exempt from the debit card interchange fee limitations 
as such  the company does not anticipate any immediate  significant impact to its interchange income 
for additional information regarding this final rule  see recent developments herein 
income from the origination and sale of loans includes origination and processing fees on residential real estate loans held for sale and gains on residential real estate loans sold to third parties 
fluctuations in market interest rates have a significant impact on revenues generated from the origination and sale of loans 
higher interest rates can reduce the demand for home loans and loans to refinance existing mortgages 
conversely  lower interest rates generally stimulate refinancing and home loan origination 
income from the origination and sale of loans decreased million  or  to million in  from million in  primarily due to declines in refinancing activity 
although mortgage rates were generally stable in  as compared to  and decreased in the latter part of  refinancing activity declined as many homeowners who qualified for refinancing did so in refinancing activity accounted for approximately of the company s residential real estate loan originations during  as compared to during 
table of contents income from the origination and sale of loans decreased million  or  to million in  from million in  due to a substantial decline in refinancing activity from early refinancing activity accounted for approximately of the company s residential real estate loan originations during  as compared to during decreases in refinancing activity were partially offset by increases in originations of new loans to purchase homes  which increased during  as compared to service charges on deposit accounts decreased thousand  or  to million in  from million in and million  or  to million in  from million in these decreases are primarily due a reduction in overdraft fees due to changes in customer utilization 
wealth management revenues are principally comprised of fees earned for management of trust assets and investment services revenues 
wealth management revenues increased thousand  or to million in  from million in  and million  or to million in  from million in these increases are primarily due to the addition of new trust customers combined with increases in the market values of new and existing assets under trust management 
also contributing to the increase in  as compared to  was the introduction of revised fee schedules in april during  we recorded net gains on the disposal of investment securities of million  as compared to net gains of thousand in net gains on disposal of investment securities in were primarily due to recognition of unamortized discounts on investment securities called by the issuing agencies during fourth quarter 
other income primarily includes company owned life insurance revenues  net gains or losses on securities held under deferred compensation plans  check printing income  agency stock dividends and gains on sales of miscellaneous assets 
other income decreased million  or  to million in  from million in  primarily due to fluctuations of values of securities held under deferred compensation plans

salaries  wages and employee benefits expense decreased million  or  to million in compared to million in primarily due to lower group health insurance costs  reductions in the market values of securities held under deferred compensation plans and reductions in full time equivalent employees 
these decreases were partially offset by normal inflationary wage increases and higher incentive bonus accruals reflective of our improved performance in salaries  wages and employee benefits expense decreased thousand  or less than  to million in compared to million for the same period in normal inflationary wage increases and increases in group health insurance and stock based compensation expenses were more than offset by reductions in sales commissions and bonus accruals in oreo expense is recorded net of oreo income 
net oreo expense increased thousand  or  to million in  as compared to million in  and increased million  or  to million in  as compared to million in increases in net oreo expense between periods was primarily due to write downs of the estimated fair value of oreo properties

table of contents fdic insurance premiums decreased million  or  to million in  from million in in february  the fdic issued a final rule that  among other things  modified the definition of an institution s deposit insurance assessment base and revised assessment rate schedules 
these changes  which became effective april   reduced the company s fdic insurance premiums in fdic insurance premiums decreased million  or  to million in  from million in  primarily due to a special fdic insurance assessment levied during second quarter  which was applicable to all insured depository institutions  and resulted in additional fdic insurance expense of million 
in addition  effective july   we opted out of participation in the transaction account guarantee component of the temporary liquidity guaranty program  which further reduced our fdic insurance premiums beginning in third quarter mortgage servicing rights are amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income 
mortgage servicing rights amortization decreased million  or  to million in  from million in and decreased million  or  to million in  from million in  primarily due to lower prepayment rates and the december sale of mortgage servicing rights with a carrying value of million 
mortgage servicing rights are evaluated quarterly for impairment based on the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights 
the fair value of mortgage servicing rights is estimated by discounting the expected future cash flows  taking into consideration the estimated level of prepayments based on current industry expectations and the predominant risk characteristics of the underlying loans 
impairment adjustments are recorded through a valuation allowance 
the valuation allowance is adjusted for changes in impairment through a charge to current period earnings 
fluctuations in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights are primarily due to changes in assumptions regarding prepayments of the underlying mortgage loans  which typically correspond with changes in market interest rates 
during we recorded impairment of million  as compared to the reversal of previously recorded impairment of thousand during and million in other expenses primarily include professional fees  advertising and public relations costs  office supply  postage  freight  telephone and travel expenses  donations expense  debit and credit card expenses  board of director fees  and other losses

construction loans decreased million  or  to million as of december   from million as of december  construction loans decreased million  or  to million as of december   from million as of december  management attributes these decreases to the continuing impact of general declines in new home construction in our market areas  particularly in markets dependent upon resort and second home communities  and  to a lesser extent  the movement of lower quality loans out of our loan portfolio through charge off  pay off or foreclosure 
management expects construction loans to continue to decline in future quarters as existing non performing construction loans continue to work through the credit cycle 
construction activity in our market areas remains soft  as reflected by decreases in housing permits and new housing starts 
housing permits in montana  wyoming and south dakota showed a combined decrease of during the eleven months ended november   as compared to the same period in additionally  privately owned  unit housing starts in montana  wyoming and south dakota showed a combined decrease during the eleven months ended november   as compared to the same period in residential real estate loans 
residential real estate loans increased million  or  to million as of december   from million as of december   and increased million  or  to million as of december   from million as of december  record low mortgage interest rates resulted in increased residential real estate loan production during in addition  we typically sell a significant portion of our residential real estate loan production in the secondary market  however  during we began to retain more of our residential real estate loans 
retained residential real estate loans are typically secured by first liens on the financed property and generally mature in less than fifteen years 
consumer loans 
our consumer loans include direct personal loans  credit card loans and lines of credit  and indirect loans created when we purchase consumer loan contracts advanced for the purchase of automobiles  boats and other consumer goods from the consumer product dealer network within the market areas we serve 
personal loans and indirect dealer loans are generally secured by automobiles  recreational vehicles  boats and other types of personal property and are made on an installment basis 
credit cards are offered to customers in our market areas 
lines of credit are generally floating rate loans that are unsecured or secured by personal property 
approximately and of our consumer loans as of december  and  respectively  were indirect dealer loans 
consumer loans decreased million  or  to million as of december   from million as of december  approximately of this decrease occurred in indirect dealer loans and was the result of competitive rate pressure 
management attributes the remaining decrease to changes in consumer behavior resulting from continuing economic uncertainty 
consumer loans decreased million  or  to million as of december   from million as of december   primarily due to the third quarter sale of student loans of million 
commercial loans 
we provide a mix of variable and fixed rate commercial loans 
the loans are typically made to small and medium sized manufacturing  wholesale  retail and service businesses for working capital needs and business expansions 
commercial loans generally include lines of credit  business credit cards and loans with maturities of five years or less 
the loans are generally made with business operations as the primary source of repayment  but also include collateralization by inventory  accounts receivable  equipment and or personal guarantees 
commercial loans decreased million  or  to million as of december   from million as of december   and decreased million  or  to million as of december   from million as of december  management attributes these decreases to the continuing effects of economic uncertainty on borrowers in our market areas and the movement of lower quality loans out of our loan portfolio through charge off  pay off or foreclosure 

table of contents agricultural loans 
our agricultural loans generally consist of short and medium term loans and lines of credit that are primarily used for crops  livestock  equipment and general operations 
agricultural loans are ordinarily secured by assets such as livestock or equipment and are repaid from the operations of the farm or ranch 
agricultural loans generally have maturities of five years or less  with operating lines for one production season 
agricultural loans increased million  or  to million as of december   from million as of december  and decreased million  or  to million as of december   from million as of december  the following table presents the maturity distribution of our loan portfolio and the sensitivity of the loans to changes in interest rates as of december  maturities and interest rate sensitivities dollars in thousands within one year one year to five years after five years total real estate consumer commercial agricultural other mortgage loans held for sale total loans loans at fixed interest rates loans at variable interest rates non accrual loans total loans non performing assets non performing assets include non performing loans and oreo

residential and second home subdivisions in these market areas were overbuilt and these markets are now experiencing severely depressed real estate values and limited sales activity  which has negatively impacted commercial real estate values as well 
the flathead  gallatin valley and jackson market areas accounted for approximately of our non performing assets as of december  and of our total loans as of the same date 

table of contents non performing loans 
non performing loans include non accrual loans  loans contractually past due days or more and still accruing interest and loans renegotiated in troubled debt restructurings 
impaired loans are a subset of non performing loans and include all loans risk rated doubtful  loans placed on non accrual status and loans renegotiated in troubled debt restructurings with the exception of consumer loans 
we monitor and evaluate collateral values on impaired loans quarterly 
appraisals are required on all impaired loans every months  or sooner as conditions necessitate 
we monitor real estate values by market for our larger market areas 
based on trends in real estate values  adjustments may be made to the appraised value based on time elapsed between the appraisal date and the impairment analysis or a new appraisal may be ordered 
appraised values in our smaller market areas may be adjusted based on trends identified through discussions with local realtors and appraisers 
appraisals are also adjusted for selling costs 
the adjusted appraised value is then compared to the loan balance and any resulting shortfall is recorded in the allowance for loan losses as a specific valuation allowance 
overall increases in specific valuation allowances will result in higher provisions for loan losses 
provisions for loan losses are also impacted by changes in the historical or general valuation elements of the allowance for loan losses as well 
the following table sets forth the allocation of our non performing loans among our different types of loans as of the dates indicated 
non performing loans by loan type dollars in thousands as of december  real estate consumer commercial agricultural other total non performing loans as of december   our non performing real estate loans were divided among the following categories million  or  land and land development  million  or  commercial  million  or residential construction  million  or  residential  million  or commercial construction  and  million  or  agricultural 
as of december   our non performing real estate loans were divided among the following categories million  or  land and land development  million  or  commercial  million  or residential construction  million  or  residential  million  or commercial construction  and  million  or  agricultural 
total non performing loans increased million  or  to million as of december   from million as of december   and million  or  to million as of december   from million as of december  significant components of these increases are discussed below 
non accrual loans 
we generally place loans on non accrual when they become days past due  unless they are well secured and in the process of collection 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  any interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed from income 
approximately million  million and million of gross interest income would have been accrued if all loans on non accrual had been current in accordance with their original terms for the years ended december   and  respectively 
non accrual loans increased million  or  to million at december   from million at december  as of december   approximately of our non accrual loans were to borrowers in the flathead  gallatin valley and jackson market areas and were comprised primarily of commercial real estate and construction loans 
non accrual loans increased million  or  to million at december   from million at december  approximately of the increase in non accrual loans were loans to borrowers in the flathead  gallatin valley and jackson market areas and were comprised primarily of commercial real estate and construction loans 

table of contents troubled debt restructuring 
modifications of performing loans are made in the ordinary course of business and are completed on a case by case basis as negotiated with the borrower 
loan modifications typically include interest rate concessions  interest only periods  short term payment deferrals and extension of amortization periods to provide payment relief 
a loan modification is considered a troubled debt restructuring if the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and we  for economic or legal reasons  grant a concession to the borrower that we would not otherwise consider 
those modifications deemed to be troubled debt restructurings are monitored centrally to ensure proper classification as a troubled debt restructuring and if or when the loan may be placed on accrual status or removed from impaired loan status 
troubled debt restructuring loans increased to million as of december   from million as of december  approximately of our restructured loans as of december   were located in the flathead  gallatin valley and jackson market areas 
as of december   approximately of our restructured loans were performing in accordance with their modified terms 
troubled debt restructurings in the preceding non performing assets table includes thousand of accruing loans past due days or more as of december  all other non performing restructured loans are included in non accrual loans in the preceding non performing assets and non performing loan tables 
troubled debt restructuring loans increased to million as of december   from million as of december   primarily due to the loans of one commercial and five commercial real estate borrowers 
approximately of our restructured loans as of december  were located in the flathead  gallatin valley and jackson market areas 
oreo 
oreo consists of real property acquired through foreclosure on the collateral underlying defaulted loans 
we initially record oreo at fair value less estimated costs to sell by a charge against the allowance for loan losses 
estimated losses that result from the ongoing periodic valuation of these properties are charged to earnings in the period in which they are identified 
the fair values of oreo properties are estimated using appraisals and management estimates of current market conditions 
oreo properties are appraised every months unless deterioration in local market conditions indicates the need to obtain new appraisals sooner 
oreo properties are evaluated by management quarterly to determine if additional write downs are appropriate or necessary based on current market conditions 
quarterly evaluations include a review of the most recent appraisal of the property and reviews of recent appraisals and comparable sales data for similar properties in the same or adjacent market areas 
commercial and agricultural oreo properties are listed with unrelated third party professional real estate agents or brokers local to the areas where the marketed properties are located 
residential properties are typically listed with local realtors  after any redemption period has expired 
we rely on these local real estate agents and or brokers to list the properties on the local multiple listing system  to provide marketing materials and advertisements for the properties and to conduct open houses 
oreo increased million  or  to million as of december  from million as of december  during  the company recorded additions to oreo of million  wrote down the fair value of oreo properties by million and sold oreo with a book value of million 
as of december   approximately of our oreo properties were located in the flathead  gallatin valley and jackson market areas 
oreo decreased million  or  to million as of december  from million as of december  during  the company recorded additions to oreo of million  wrote down the fair value of oreo properties by million and sold oreo with a book value of million 
allowance for loan losses the company performs a quarterly assessment of the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the methodology used to assess the adequacy is consistently applied to the company s loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses based on our evaluation of known and inherent risk in our loan portfolio at each balance sheet date 
in determining the allowance for loan losses  we estimate losses on specific loans  or groups of loans  where the probable loss can be identified and reasonably determined 
the balance of the allowance for loan losses is based on internally assigned risk classifications of loans  historical loan loss rates  changes in the nature of the loan portfolio  overall portfolio quality  industry concentrations  delinquency trends  current economic factors and the estimated impact of current economic conditions on certain historical loan loss rates 
see the discussion under critical accounting estimates and significant accounting policies allowance for loan losses above 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by provisions charged against earnings and reduced by net loan charge offs 
loans  or portions thereof  are charged off when management believes that the collectibility of the principal is unlikely or  with respect to consumer installment and credit card loans  according to established delinquency schedules 

table of contents the allowance for loan losses consists of three elements specific valuation allowances associated with impaired loans 
specific valuation allowances are determined based on assessment of the fair value of the collateral underlying the loans as determined through independent appraisals  the present value of future cash flows  observable market prices and any relevant qualitative or environmental factors impacting the loan 
no specific valuation allowances are recorded for impaired loans that are adequately secured 
historical valuation allowances based on loan loss experience for similar loans with similar characteristics and trends 
historical valuation allowances are determined by applying percentage loss factors to the credit exposures from outstanding loans 
for commercial  agricultural and real estate loans  loss factors are applied based on the internal risk classifications of these loans 
for consumer loans  loss factors are applied on a portfolio basis 
for commercial  agriculture and real estate loans  loss factor percentages are based on a migration analysis of our historical loss experience  designed to account for credit deterioration 
for consumer loans  loss factor percentages are based on a one year loss history 
general valuation allowances determined based on changes in the nature of the loan portfolio  overall portfolio quality  industry concentrations  delinquency trends  general economic conditions and other qualitative risk factors both internal and external to us 
based on the assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  management records provisions for loan losses to maintain the allowance for loan losses at appropriate levels 
loans  or portions thereof  are charged off against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that the collectability of the principal is unlikely  or  with respect to consumer installment loans  according to an established delinquency schedule 
generally  loans are charged off when there has been no material principal reduction within the previous days and there is no pending sale of collateral or other assets  there is no significant or pending event which will result in principal reduction within the upcoming days  it is clear that we will not be able to collect all or a portion of the loan  payments on the loan are sporadic  will result in an excessive amortization or are not consistent with the collateral held and foreclosure or repossession actions are pending 
loan charge offs do not directly correspond with the receipt of independent appraisals or the use of observable market data if the collateral value is determined to be sufficient to repay the principal balance of the loan 
if the impaired loan is adequately collateralized  a specific valuation allowance is not recorded 
as such  significant changes in impaired and non performing loans do not necessarily correspond proportionally with changes in the specific valuation component of the allowance for loan losses 
additionally  management expects the timing of charge offs will vary between quarters and will not necessarily correspond proportionally to changes in the allowance for loan losses or changes in non performing or impaired loans due to timing differences among the initial identification of an impaired loan  recording of a specific valuation allowance for the impaired loan and any resulting charge off of uncollectible principal 
based on declines in national  regional and local economies which began in  we began to record additional general valuation allowances based on management s estimation of the probable impact that the declines would have on our loan portfolio 
accordingly  beginning in  and continuing in and  we recorded significantly higher provisions for loan losses to maintain the allowance for loan losses at appropriate levels 
during  and  we experienced higher levels of impaired and non performing loans as anticipated 
impaired and non performing loans peaked in mid and our provision for loan losses decreased slightly during the last half of management expects that non performing and impaired loans will continue to decline as they make their way through the credit cycle and we have a decrease in the volume of newly identified non performing and impaired loans as the economy improves

increases in the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans as of december   as compared to prior periods  were primarily attributable to additional reserves recorded based on the estimated effects of current economic conditions on our loan portfolio and increases in past due  non performing and internally risk classified loans 
net charge offs in increased million to million  or of average loans  from million  or of average loans in approximately of loans charged off during were related to the loans of one consumer real estate  two land development and three commercial borrowers

table of contents although we believe that we have established our allowance for loan losses in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and that the allowance for loan losses was adequate to provide for known and inherent losses in the portfolio at all times during the five year period ended december   future provisions will be subject to on going evaluations of the risks in the loan portfolio 
if the economy declines or asset quality deteriorates  material additional provisions could be required 
the allowance for loan losses is allocated to loan categories based on the relative risk characteristics  asset classifications and actual loss experience of the loan portfolio 
the following table provides a summary of the allocation of the allowance for loan losses for specific loan categories as of the dates indicated 
the allocations presented should not be interpreted as an indication that charges to the allowance for loan losses will be incurred in these amounts or proportions  or that the portion of the allowance allocated to each loan category represents the total amount available for future losses that may occur within these categories

stockholders equity increased million  or  to million as of december  from million as of december   due primarily to the retention of earnings and increases in net unrealized gains on available for sale investment securities 
we paid aggregate cash dividends of million to common shareholders and million to preferred shareholders during stockholders equity increased million  or  to million as of december  from million as of december   primarily due to the completion of our ipo of class a common stock discussed below

table of contents as a holding company  we are a corporation separate and apart from our subsidiary bank and  therefore  we provide for our own liquidity 
our main sources of funding include management fees and dividends declared and paid by our subsidiaries and access to capital markets 
there are statutory  regulatory and debt covenant limitations that affect the ability of our bank to pay dividends to us 
management believes that such limitations will not impact our ability to meet our ongoing short term cash obligations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
our business and the composition of our balance sheet consists of investments in interest earning assets principally loans and investment securities which are primarily funded by interest bearing liabilities deposits and indebtedness 
such financial instruments have varying levels of sensitivity to changes in market interest rates 
interest rate risk results when  due to different maturity dates and repricing intervals  interest rate indices for interest earning assets decrease relative to interest bearing liabilities  thereby creating a risk of decreased net earnings and cash flow 
although we characterize some of our interest sensitive assets as securities available for sale  such securities are not purchased with a view to sell in the near term 
rather  such securities may be sold in response to or in anticipation of changes in interest rates and resulting prepayment risk 
see notes to consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting policies included in part iv  item of this report 
asset liability management the goal of asset liability management is the prudent control of market risk  liquidity and capital 
asset liability management is governed by policies  goals and objectives adopted and reviewed by the bank s board of directors 
the board delegates its responsibility for development of asset liability management strategies to achieve these goals and objectives to the asset liability committee  or alco  which is comprised of members of senior management 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk of loss of future earnings or long term value due to changes in interest rates 
our primary source of earnings is the net interest margin  which is affected by changes in interest rates  the relationship between rates on interest bearing assets and liabilities  the impact of interest rate fluctuations on asset prepayments and the mix of interest bearing assets and liabilities 
the ability to optimize the net interest margin is largely dependent upon the achievement of an interest rate spread that can be managed during periods of fluctuating interest rates 
interest sensitivity is a measure of the extent to which net interest income will be affected by market interest rates over a period of time 
interest rate sensitivity is related to the difference between amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities which either reprice or mature within a given period of time 
the difference is known as interest rate sensitivity gap 

table of contents the following table shows interest rate sensitivity gaps and the earnings sensitivity ratio for different intervals as of december  the information presented in the table is based on our mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and historical experience regarding their interest rate sensitivity 
interest rate sensitivity gaps dollars in thousands projected maturity or repricing three months or less three months to one year one year to five years after five years total interest earning assets loans investment securities interest bearing deposits in banks federal funds sold total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities interest bearing demand accounts savings deposits time deposits  or more other time deposits securities sold under repurchase agreements other borrowed funds long term debt subordinated debentures held by subsidiary trusts total interest bearing liabilities rate gap cumulative rate gap cumulative rate gap as a percentage of total interest earning assets does not include non accrual loans of  adjusted to reflect a expected shorter maturities based upon our historical experience of early prepayments of principal  and b the redemption of callable securities on their next call date 
includes savings deposits paying interest at market rates in the three month or less category 
all other deposit categories  while technically subject to immediate withdrawal  actually display sensitivity characteristics that generally fall within one to five years 
their allocation is presented based on that historical analysis 
if these deposits were included in the three month or less category  the above table would reflect a negative three month gap of  million  a negative cumulative one year gap of  million and a positive cumulative one to five year gap of million 
net interest income sensitivity we believe net interest income sensitivity provides the best perspective of how day to day decisions affect our interest rate risk profile 
we monitor net interest margin sensitivity by utilizing an income simulation model to subject twelve month net interest income to various rate movements 
simulations modeled quarterly include scenarios where market rates change suddenly up or down in a parallel manner and scenarios where market rates gradually change up or down at nonparallel rates resulting in a change in the slope of the yield curve 
estimates produced by our income simulation model are based on numerous assumptions including  but not limited to  the nature and timing of changes in interest rates  prepayments of loans and investment securities  volume of loans originated  level and composition of deposits  ability of borrowers to repay adjustable or variable rate loans and reinvestment opportunities for cash flows 
given these various assumptions  the actual effect of interest rate changes on our net interest margin may be materially different than estimated 

table of contents we target a mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities such that no more than of the net interest margin will be at risk over a one year period should short term interest rates shift up or down 
as of december   our income simulation model predicted net interest income would decrease million  or less than  assuming a increase in short term and long term interest rates over a twelve month period 
this scenario predicts that our funding sources will reprice slightly faster than our interest earning assets 
we have not engaged in derivatives or hedging activities to manage our interest rate risk 
we did not simulate a decrease in interest rates due to the extremely low rate environment as of december  prime rate has historically been set at a rate of basis points over the targeted federal funds rate  which is currently set between and basis points 
our income simulation model has an assumption that prime will continue to be set at a rate of basis points over the targeted federal funds rate 
additionally  rates that are currently below are modeled not to fall below with an overall decrease of in interest rates 
the preceding interest rate sensitivity analysis does not represent a forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
in addition  if the actual prime rate falls below a basis point spread to targeted federal funds rates  we could experience a continued decrease in net interest income as a result of falling yields on earning assets tied to prime rate
