item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general this section presents discussion and analysis of our financial condition at december  and  and our results of operations for each of the three years in the period ended december  this section should be read in conjunction with our accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes in this report 
for a detailed discussion of our business  see item business in this report 
critical accounting policies general 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and the information included in management s discussion and analysis is governed by policies that are based on accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap and general practices within the banking industry 
the financial information contained in our financial statements is  to a significant extent  based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset or relieving a liability 
in addition  gaap itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it is important to a company s results of operations and financial condition  and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
we believe that the estimates and assumptions used in connection with the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures contained herein are reasonable and made in good faith 

table of contents we consider our critical accounting policies to be those that relate to the determination of the following our allowance for loan losses  our valuation allowance for real estate losses  other than temporary impairment assessments of our security investments  and the need for and amount of a valuation allowance for our deferred tax asset 
these items are considered critical accounting estimates because each is highly susceptible to change from period to period and require us to make numerous assumptions about a variety of information that directly affect the calculation of the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
for example  the impact of a large unexpected chargeoff could deplete the allowance for loan losses and potentially require us to record increased loan loss provisions to replenish the allowance  which could negatively affect our operating results and financial condition 
for a summary of our other significant accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements in this report 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses reflects our judgment as to the estimated credit losses that may result from defaults in our loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a loan loss provision charged to expense 
loans are charged off against the allowance when we believe that the collection of any portion of the principal amount of the loan balance is confirmed as a loss 
subsequent recoveries of previous chargeoffs are added back to the allowance 
we evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses at least quarterly or more frequently when necessary 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires us to make estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
the allowance consists of specific and general components 
for loans that are not impaired  the general component of the allowance is based on a number of factors that begin with our actual historical loss experience by major loan category expressed as a percentage of outstanding loans 
in determining our historical loss rate  our net charge off history excludes those that arose from the may bulk sale  which comprised the sale of a large number of performing tdrs  nonaccrual loans  other performing loans and some ore at sales prices substantially below the appraised values of these assets 
the assets were sold substantially below their net carrying values as we were required to expedite the reduction of our problem assets during a time when the financial markets were volatile and real property values were depressed 
we believe the result of the bulk sale was not indicative of the ultimate losses that may have occurred had the assets been resolved on an individual basis  over time and not on a steeply discounted immediate bulk sale basis 
a transaction that is unusual and deemed not reflective of normal charge off history can be excluded from an historical analysis 
we have suffered all of our historical lending losses in the period from through the bulk of our loan originations from through continue to perform during what can be described as the most difficult economic time period since the great depression 
because actual loss experience may not adequately predict the level of losses inherent in a portfolio  we then also review other qualitative factors to determine if our historical loss rate should be increased or decreased based upon a review of those factors 
our evaluation considers the following qualitative factors 
i size of our loans 
our loan portfolio has many individual loans with large principal balances 
at december   the average real estate loan was million  with the largest loan being million 
in addition  loans of million or more represented approximately of the loan portfolio 
these indicators have improved since the middle of as our new loan originations since then have been curtailed dramatically and those loans that were originated were smaller balance loans 
the default of a larger size loan may have a greater negative impact on our lending losses 
ii concentrations of our loans 
our loan portfolio is concentrated in loans secured by commercial and multifamily real estate  including some properties that are vacant or substantially vacant and vacant land  all of which are generally considered to have more credit risk than traditional family residential lending because these loans tend to involve larger loan balances to single borrowers and their repayment is typically dependent upon the successful operation of the underlying real estate for income producing properties 
additionally  loans on vacant properties and land typically do not have adequate or any income streams and depend upon other sources of cash flow from the borrower for repayment 
the number of vacant land loans in the portfolio  while never a substantial amount relative to the entire portfolio  has decreased substantially over the last several years 

table of contents commercial real estate loans totaled million and comprised of the total loan portfolio and of tier regulatory capital at december  such loans include vacant land loans  which currently represent less than of the portfolio or million and they are personally guaranteed 
multifamily real estate loans totaled million and comprised of the total loan portfolio and of tier regulatory capital at december  the properties that collateralize our loans are also concentrated in two states  new york and florida  and many are also located in geographical areas of those states that are being revitalized or redeveloped  which are negatively impacted to a greater degree in an economic downturn 
additionally  many of the multifamily properties located in new york city and surrounding boroughs are also subject to rent control and rent stabilization laws  which limit the ability of the property owners to increase some rents  which may in turn limit the borrower s ability to repay those mortgage loans 
rent controls usually keep many rents below those which have no restriction and are free market rents 
outside of new york  nearly all of our loans on multifamily properties are garden style apartments  which refer to a large development of small apartment buildings 
each building is perhaps two to four stories tall  and there are no internal hallways  although adjacent apartments may share a wall 
access to apartments are from a common stairwell or patio  and the buildings are typically surrounded by outdoor landscaping or patios 
garden apartments have additional risks associated with maintenance costs due to multiple buildings  roofs  air conditioners  etc 
all of the above factors increase the risk profile of our loan portfolio 
iii changes in the quality of our review of specific problem loans  including loans on nonaccrual status  and estimates of fair value of the underlying properties 
when a loan experiences payment problems  an internal review is initiated by our chief credit officer to re evaluate the internal credit rating that is assigned to the loan 
we also engage an independent third party to perform quarterly reviews of the entire loan portfolio  which includes all problem loans 
nonaccrual and or problem loans are normally downgraded or upgraded based on known facts and circumstances at the time of review  which includes the review of rent rolls  financial statements and strength of borrower s repayment sources and a physical inspection and a determination of the estimated fair value of the collateral property 
management also takes into consideration the nature and extent of personal guarantees and global cash flow analysis in determining credit ratings 
estimates of fair value are determined based on a variety of information  including available appraisals and the knowledge and experience of our two senior lending officers and chief credit officer related to values of properties in our lending market areas 
our policy is to obtain externally prepared appraisals or other indications of value for all new  restructured  or renewed loans  upon the classification or downgrade of a loan  and upon foreclosure and transfer of a loan to foreclosed real estate  and at least annually thereafter for all impaired loans and real estate owned 
in addition to appraisals  consideration is also given to the type  location and occupancy of the property and current economic conditions in the area the property is located in assessing estimates of fair value 
additionally  since march we require that all third party appraisals we receive be reviewed by a different external appraiser for reasonableness 
we believe our process of reviewing loans and determining estimated fair values is effective 
iv changes in the volume of our past due loans  nonaccrual loans and adversely classified assets 
in may  we sold a total of million of certain non performing and underperforming loans in a bulk sale in order to expedite the resolution of such assets 
due to the then market conditions  the assets were sold at a significant discount to their net carrying values 
this transaction as well as other steps we have taken significantly decreased our nonaccrual and problem loans 
in addition  our special mention and substandard rated loans decreased from approximately million and million  respectively  prior to the bulk sale to approximately million and million  respectively  at december  v adverse situations which may affect our borrowers ability to repay 
nonaccrual problem loans are reviewed individually based on the facts and circumstances known to us at that time 
an assessment is made as to whether there are specific issues unique to each loan or borrower that caused the problem or whether such issues identified are generic systemic to the entire or a large portion of the loan portfolio and as such increase the risk profile of the loan portfolio 

table of contents in addition to the negative impact from the weak economy  high rates of unemployment  and increased office and retail vacancy rates  we believe that a large number of our loans that became nonaccrual over the last several years also had specific issues unique to each loan that resulted in the loan being classified as nonaccrual 
vi changes in national  regional and local new york and florida economic and business conditions and other developments that may affect the collectability of our loan portfolio  including impacts of political  regulatory  legal and competitive changes on the portfolio 
we continually monitor real estate market and economic conditions  both locally in our lending areas and on a national level 
the monitoring process is done through the review of various publications  discussions with brokers and existing customers and analysis of market rents 
the economy and commercial and multifamily real estate markets both nationally and in our new york and florida markets have shown improvement in but remain weak 
political and regulatory issues  including armed conflicts and acts of terrorism  or natural disasters such as hurricanes  may have an adverse impact on economic conditions as a whole and may be more pronounced on loans in specific geographic regions 
vii changes to our lending policies and procedures  underwriting standards  risk selection loan volumes and loan terms and to our collection  loan chargeoff and recovery practices 
we have not relaxed any of these policies  procedures and practices 
furthermore  we believe that we have become more risk averse over the last year by being more selective in originating new loans 
the loan to value ratio the ratio that the original principal amount of the loan bears to the lower of the purchase price or appraised value of the property securing the loan at the time of origination on a new loan normally does not exceed 
the debt service coverage ratio the ratio of the net operating income generated by the property securing the loan to the required debt service on a new loan typically is not less than times 
additionally  we continue to enhance our loan origination and monitoring process  including the following adding more detailed policy guidelines for acceptable debt service coverage ratios based on maximum amortization periods for commercial and multifamily properties  established more detailed requirements for personal guarantees  formalized our credit approval process  revised our loan presentation format to the loan committee to clearly identity any policy exceptions  enhanced the portfolio stratification to better identify concentration risks  enhanced our tdr policy to better identify loans experiencing financial difficulties  enhanced our credit grading policy  updated our appraisal requirement policy  including accelerating the ordering of new appraisals when loans are experiencing payment difficulty  established a formal third party review process of all appraisals  established a criticized asset report committee to review and approve quarterly analyses  created penetration reports evidencing the obtaining of various types of financial or performance data  and instituted reviews and action plans on a quarterly basis for all classified loans 
viii changes in the experience  ability and depth of our lending management and other relevant staff 
we have a chief credit officer with years of experience who reviews the assignment of credit ratings for all loans and attends all loan committee meetings and provides his input 
we also added to and expect to continue to expand the number of our loan relationship managers to monitor our loans 
these changes coupled with the depth of our existing staff and the substantial experience of our chairman and president in commercial and multifamily real estate lending have had a positive effect on this qualitative factor 
we believe there is substantial experience on our lending and underwriting staff and on our loan committee 
in addition to the general component discussed earlier  the specific component of the allowance relates to loans that are impaired 
a loan is normally deemed impaired when  based upon current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect both principal and interest due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
we consider a variety of factors in determining whether a loan is impaired  including i any notice from the borrower that the borrower will be unable to repay all principal and interest amounts contractually due under the loan agreement  ii any delinquency in the principal and or interest payments other than minimal delays or shortfalls in payments  and iii other information known by us that would indicate the full repayment of principal and interest is not probable 
we generally consider delinquencies of days or less to be minimal delays  and accordingly do not consider such delinquent loans to be impaired in the absence of other indications 

table of contents our impaired loans normally consist of loans on nonaccrual status and those classified as troubled debt restructurings tdrs 
generally  impairment for all of our loans is calculated on a loan by loan basis using either the estimated fair value of the loan s collateral less estimated selling costs for collateral dependent loans or the present value of the loan s cash flows for non collateral dependent loans 
any calculated impairment is recognized as a valuation allowance within the overall allowance for loan losses and a charge through the provision for loan losses 
we may charge off any portion of the impaired loan with a corresponding decrease to the valuation allowance when such impairment is deemed uncollectible 
the net carrying amount of an impaired loan net of the valuation allowance does not at any time exceed the recorded investment in the loan 
valuation allowance for real estate losses 
we maintain a valuation allowance for real estate we acquire through foreclosure 
we estimate the fair value of our real estate in the same manner as impaired loans 
as the properties are actively marketed for sale  we may periodically adjust the carrying values of the real estate to reflect changes in fair values resulting from changing market conditions through an increase to the valuation allowance for real estate losses and a charge to the provision for real estate losses 
we believe  based on information known to us at december   that the level of our allowance for loan losses and valuation allowance for real estate losses was adequate to cover estimated losses in our loan and real estate owned portfolios at such date 
although we believe we use the best information available to make determinations with respect to these allowances  future adjustments to one or both allowances may be necessary if facts and circumstances differ from those previously assumed in their determination 
for example  a prolonged downturn in real estate values and economic conditions could have an adverse impact on our asset quality and may result in a higher level of losses than we have provided for which would result in additional loss provisions 
additionally  our regulators  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review both of these allowances based on the regulators judgment concerning information available to them during their examination process as well as other factors they utilize for all banks 
accordingly  they may require us to take certain chargeoffs and or recognize additions to the allowances based on their judgments 
other than temporary impairment charges on security investments 
for a discussion of the factors and estimates used in assessing for and computing other than temporary impairment charges on our security investments  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
as disclosed in greater detail in note to the consolidated financial statements in this report  at december   we had a deferred tax asset in the amount of million  which included unused net operating loss carryfowards nols 
we determined that it was not necessary to maintain a valuation allowance for our deferred tax asset at any time during the reporting periods in this report because we believe that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax asset will be fully realized 
the need for as well as adjustments increases or decreases to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance is determined by us based upon changes in the expected realization of the deferred tax asset 
we evaluate our deferred tax asset for recoverability quarterly based on all available evidence 
this process involves significant judgment on our part and includes assumptions that are subject to change from period to period based on changes in tax laws or variances between our projected earnings and our actual results 
we are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if we determine  based on available evidence at the time the determination is made  that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be fully realized 
in evaluating the more likely than not criterion  we consider all positive and negative evidence as of the end of each reporting period 
the realization of our deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient future taxable income in the carryforward period under the tax law 
due to significant estimates utilized in establishing the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances  we may be required to establish and or record adjustments to the valuation allowance in future reporting periods 
such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and regulatory capital position 
the conclusion not to maintain a valuation allowance as noted above is based on our prior earnings history exclusive of the nol generated in the second quarter of coupled with evidence such as returning to profitability since the third quarter of indicating that we will be able to generate an adequate amount of future taxable income over a reasonable period of time to fully utilize the deferred tax asset 

table of contents our ability to realize our deferred tax asset could be reduced in the future if our estimates of future taxable income from our operations and tax planning strategies do not support the realization of our deferred tax asset 
we also need to consider that the amount of our nols and certain other tax attributes realizable for income tax purposes may be reduced under section of the internal revenue code by sales of our common stock  including transactions in the open market by or greater shareholders  if an ownership change is deemed to have occured under section of the internal revenue code by such sales 
the determination of whether an ownership change has occurred is highly fact specific and can occur through one or more acquisitions of capital stock including open market trading if the result of such acquisitions is that the percentage of our outstanding common stock held by shareholders or groups of shareholders owning at least of our common stock at the time of such acquisition  as determined under section  is more than percentage points higher than the lowest percentage of our outstanding common stock owned by such shareholders or groups of shareholders within the prior three year period 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report  in may  october and november  ibc sold to various investors   and  shares of its class a common stock  respectively 
we have determined based on an internal analysis that the completion of these transactions did not result in a change of control as defined by section  although no assurance can be given that taxing authorities would agree with such determination 
the combination of these sales with any future sales of ibc s common stock during the period defined above  could increase the risk of a change in control as determined under section and result in the partial loss of the availability of our nols  which would require us to expense a portion of our then deferred tax asset amount 
as of december   we had no plan to issue additional capital securities other than the issuance of shares of class a common stock in connection with our shareholder approved long term incentive plan under which stock options  restricted stock and other forms of incentive compensation may be awarded from time to time to our officers  employees and directors 
comparison of financial condition at december  and a comparison of selected consolidated balance sheet information follows at december  at december  in thousands carrying value of total assets carrying value of total assets cash and cash equivalents securities and other investments loans receivable  net of deferred fees and allowance for loan losses foreclosed real estate  net of valuation allowance all other assets total assets deposits borrowed funds and related interest payable all other liabilities total liabilities total stockholders equity total liabilities and stockholders equity general consolidated assets at december  decreased by million  or  to billion  from billion at december   primarily reflecting a decrease in loans receivable  partially offset by an increase in security and other investments 
the net decrease in loans funded a reduction in deposit liabilities and borrowed funds 
during  inb gradually reduced its balance sheet by decreasing its deposit rates and encouraging net deposit outflow  repaying its borrowed funds and brokered cds as they matured and decreasing the volume of its new loan originations from historical levels 
in addition to this planned decrease in assets and liabilities  the decrease in loans was also partially attributable to decreased lending opportunities due to current economic conditions 
the overall decrease in assets positively impacted our regulatory capital ratios 

table of contents cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents include interest bearing and noninterest bearing cash balances with banks  and other short term investments that have original maturities of three months or less 
cash and cash equivalents increased to million at december  from million at december  the level of cash and cash equivalents fluctuates based on various factors  including our liquidity needs  loan demand  deposit flows  calls of securities  repayments of borrowed funds and alternative investment opportunities 
see the section liquidity and capital resources in this report for a discussion of our liquidity 
securities and other investments these investments consist of securities held to maturity million  investments in federal reserve bank frb and federal home loan bank of new york fhlb stock million and time deposits with other banks million aggregating to million at december   compared to million at december  securities are classified as held to maturity and are carried at amortized cost when we have the intent and ability to hold them to maturity 
such investments  all of which were held by inb  increased to million at december   from million at december  the increase reflected million of new purchases  partially offset by million of calls  million of maturities and million of impairment writedowns 
the growth in security investments has been a function of decreased lending opportunities 
since  inb s investment portfolio experienced a high level of calls by the issuers due to the low interest rate environment 
at december   securities held to maturity consisted of investment grade debt obligations of the federal home loan bank  federal farm credit bank  federal national mortgage association and federal home loan mortgage corporation totaling million and noninvestment grade corporate securities consisting of variable rate pooled trust preferred securities backed by obligations of companies in the banking industry totaling million 
as discussed in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements in this report  impairment charges totaling million have been recorded on these trust preferred security investments 
at december   the held to maturity portfolio had a weighted average yield to earliest call date of and a weighted average remaining contractual maturity of years 
nearly all of the securities have fixed interest rates or have predetermined rate increases and call features that allow the issuer to call the security before its stated maturity without penalty 
over the next twelve months  approximately million of securities in the portfolio could potentially be called assuming market interest rates remain at or near current levels 
a large portion of the resulting proceeds would then be reinvested by inb into similar securities and potentially at lower rates 
at the time of purchase  securities with callable features routinely have higher yields than non callable securities with the same maturity 
however  the callable features or the expiration of the non callable period of the security will most likely result in the early call of securities in a declining or flat rate environment  which results in re investment risk of the proceeds in a lower rate environment 
at december  and  the held to maturity portfolio s estimated fair value was million and million  respectively 
at december   the portfolio had a net unrealized loss of million  compared to a net unrealized loss of million at december  see note to the consolidated financial statements in this report for information on and a discussion of unrealized losses 
for additional historical information on the securities portfolio  see the caption entitled security investment activities in item business of this report 
in order for inb to be a member of the frb and fhlb  inb must maintain an investment in the capital stock of each entity  which amounted to million and million  respectively  at december  the frb stock has historically paid a dividend of  while the fhlb stock dividend fluctuates quarterly and was most recently at an annual rate of on november  the total required investment fluctuates based on inb s capital level for the frb stock and inb s loans and outstanding fhlb borrowings for the fhlb stock 
loans receivable  net of deferred fees total loans receivable  net of unearned fees  amounted to billion at december   a million decrease from billion at december  
table of contents the decrease was due to an aggregate of million of principal repayments resulting from million of payoffs and million of normal amortization  million of chargeoffs and million transferred to foreclosed real estate  partially offset by million of new loan originations and a million decrease in unearned fees 
loans paid off during the period had a weighted average contractual yield of 
new loan originations during the period all had fixed interest rates and a weighted average yield and term of and years  respectively 
the terms of these loans have largely been a function of the demand by borrowers for longer term  fixed rate product that has been driven by the historically low interest rate environment since we expect this demand for longer term  fixed rate product to continue for the foreseeable future 
fixed rate loans constituted approximately of the loan portfolio at december  and the portfolio also included loans approximately of the portfolio that have terms that call for predetermined interest rate increases over the life of the loan 
see the section asset and liability management for a further discussion of fixed rate loans and their impact on our interest rate risk 
new loan originations for remained relatively unchanged from million in  reflecting the effects of a decrease in suitable lending opportunities for us as well as inb s efforts to shrink its balance sheet and maintain its loan portfolio at a prudent level relative to its capital requirements 
for additional information on and discussion of our loan portfolio  see the section entitled lending activities in item business of this report 
nonaccrual and restructured loans impaired loans nonaccrual loans amounted to million or loans at december   compared to million or loans at december  loans classified as accruing troubled debt restructured loans tdrs amounted to million or loans at december   compared to million or loans at december  for additional information on and discussion of our nonaccrual loans  tdrs and potential problem loans  see the section entitled asset quality in item business of this report 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses amounted to million at december   compared to million at december  the allowance represented of total loans net of deferred fees outstanding at december  and the net decrease in the allowance was due to million of chargeoffs  partially offset by million of loan loss provisions and million of recoveries of prior chargeoffs 
during  as result of updated appraisals received on the underlying collateral properties  we recorded million of partial chargeoffs on seven performing tdrs each classified as nonaccrual and impaired and million of partial chargeoffs on six other nonaccrual loans 
we also recorded million of additional chargeoffs resulting from the payoff of eight other loans at a discount to their net carrying value as part of our efforts to reduce problem assets 
with respect to the tdr chargeoffs  the borrowers remain obligated to pay all contractual principal due 
at december  and  the allowance for loan losses included a specific valuation allowance in the aggregate amount of million and million  respectively  for total nonaccrual and accruing restructured loans  all of which are considered impaired loans 
at december   with respect to all of our impaired loans totaling million  we have obtained current appraisals as follows dated within the last months  dated within the last months  dated within the last months  and dated within the last months 
our policy is to have externally prepared appraisals for all impaired loans at least annually 
for additional information on and discussion of the allowance for loan losses  see the caption entitled allowance for loan losses in item business of this report 
for a discussion of the criteria used to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  see the section entitled critical accounting policies at the beginning of item of this report 
foreclosed real estate real estate acquired through foreclosure  net of a valuation allowance  amounted to million at december   compared to million at december  for additional information on and discussion of foreclosed real estate  see the section entitled asset quality in item business of this report 

table of contents all other assets the following table sets forth the composition of all other assets at december  in thousands accrued interest receivable loan fees receivable income tax receivable premises and equipment  net deferred income tax asset deferred debenture offering costs  net investment in unconsolidated subsidiaries deferred issuance costs from brokered cds prepaid deposit insurance assessments all other accrued interest receivable fluctuates based on the level of interest earning assets and the timing of interest payments received 
loan fees receivable are fees due to us in accordance with the terms of our mortgage loans 
such amounts are generally due upon the full repayment of the loan 
this fee is recorded as deferred income at the time a loan is originated and is then amortized to interest income over the life of the loan as a yield adjustment 
the decrease was due to payments exceeding new fees that were charged on new loan originations as well as a lower level of new originations 
the decrease in income tax receivable was due to the receipt of an million federal income tax refund due from the carry back of our net operating loss 
the refund due was recorded as a receivable in premises and equipment decreased as purchases were more than offset by normal depreciation and amortization 
the deferred tax asset relates to the unrealized benefit for net temporary differences between the our financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases that will result in future income tax deductions 
such items are normally comprised of the allowance for loan losses  valuation allowance for real estate losses and capitalized real estate expenses  all of which will become tax deductible when actual chargeoffs are incurred  and our net operating loss carryforward that can be used to offset future taxable income 
the decrease in the deferred tax asset was attributable to the partial utilization in of our net operating loss carryforward 
see the section critical accounting policies and note to the consolidated financial statements in this report for further discussion of the deferred tax asset 
deferred debenture offering costs consist primarily of underwriters commissions and are amortized over the terms of the debentures 
the net decrease was due to normal amortization 
the investment in unconsolidated subsidiaries consists of ibc s total common stock investment in its wholly owned business trusts  intervest statutory trust ii  iii  iv and v 
prepaid deposit insurance assessments relates to the unamortized portion of the estimated amount of inb s fdic insurance premiums for that was prepaid by inb on december  this prepayment requirement was imposed on all fdic insured institutions in order to recapitalize the deposit insurance fund 
the prepaid asset will be charged to expense during the future periods to which it relates 
deferred issuance costs from brokered deposits decreased due to normal amortization 
these costs are being amortized to interest expense over the life of the deposits 
deposits total deposits at december  decreased to billion from billion at december   due to a million decrease in certificate of deposit accounts cds of which million were brokered 
at december   cds totaled billion  and checking  savings and money market accounts aggregated to million 
the same categories of deposit accounts totaled billion and million  respectively  at december  inb has steadily lowered its overall deposit rates offered for its deposit products since early to encourage deposit outflow including the ongoing repayment of maturing higher cost brokered cds and to reduce the overall size of its balance sheet 
cds represented of total consolidated deposits at december   compared to at december  
table of contents at december  and  cds included million and million of brokered deposits  respectively

official checks outstanding represent checks issued by inb in the normal course of business which fluctuate based on banking activity 
accrued interest payable on deposits fluctuates based on total deposits and the timing of interest payments 
all other liabilities are comprised mainly of accrued expenses and fees received on loan commitments that have not yet been funded 
stockholders equity the following table sets forth the change in stockholders equity in thousands  except per share amounts amount class a shares amount per share common stockholders equity at december  net earnings before preferred dividend requirements preferred dividends declared and paid amortization of preferred stock discount forfeitures of restricted stock compensation from stock options and restricted stock common stockholders equity at december  preferred stockholder s equity at december  amortization of preferred stock discount preferred stockholder s equity at december  total stockholders equity at december  represents  shares of ibc s fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock  series a  owned by the united states treasury 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
in february  ibc suspended the declaration and payment of preferred dividends on the series a stock 
at december   the amount of preferred dividends unpaid and in arrears totaled million 
dividends in arrears are recorded as reduction in common stockholders equity only when they are declared and payable 
common stock book value per share  after adjusting for preferred dividends in arrears of million  was at december  
table of contents comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and overview in  we reported net earnings available to common stockholders of million  or per diluted common share  compared to a net loss available to common stockholders of million  or per diluted common share  in the results and per share amounts reported for both and were net of million of preferred dividend requirements related to ibc s outstanding preferred stock held by the us treasury 
the million improvement in operating results was due to the following a million decrease in the total provision for loan and real estate losses  a million decrease in real estate activities expenses  a million increase in noninterest income  and a million decrease in all other noninterest expenses 
the aggregate of these items was partially offset by a million decrease in net interest and dividend income and a million increase in income tax expense 
the net loss for was driven by a bulk sale of nonperforming and underperforming assets discussed below and additional loan and real estate loss provisions due to declining commercial real estate values and continued weakness in the economy 
in may  we sold certain non performing and underperforming loans on commercial real estate and multi family properties and some real estate owned through foreclosure 
the assets sold aggregated to approximately million and consisted of million of loans and million of real estate 
the assets were sold at a substantial discount to their net carrying values totaling million for an aggregate purchase price of million

net interest and dividend income is the difference between interest income earned on our interest earning assets  such as loans and securities  and interest expense paid on our interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 

table of contents the following table provides information on average assets  liabilities and stockholders equity  yields earned on interest earning assets  and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities for and the yields and rates shown are based on a computation of income expense including any related fee income or expense for each year divided by average interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities during each year 
average balances are derived from daily balances 
net interest margin is computed by dividing net interest and dividend income by the average of total interest earning assets during each year 
the interest rate spread is the difference between the average yield earned on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest margin is greater than the interest rate spread due to the additional income earned on those assets funded by non interest bearing liabilities  demand deposits and stockholders equity

liquidity and capital resources general 
liquidity risk involves the risk of being unable to fund our assets with the appropriate duration and rate based liabilities  as well as the risk of not being able to meet unexpected cash needs 
we manage our liquidity position on a daily basis to assure that funds are available to meet our operating requirements  loan and investment commitments  deposit withdrawals and debt service obligations 
our primary sources of funds consist of the following retail deposits obtained through inb s branch offices and the mail  principal repayments of loans  maturities and calls of securities  borrowings through fhlb advances or the federal funds market  brokered deposits  and cash flow provided by our operating activities 
for additional detail concerning our actual cash flows  see the consolidated statements of cash flows included in this report 
intervest national bank 
inb s lending business is dependent on its ability to generate a positive interest rate spread between the yields earned on its loans and the rates offered on its deposits 
inb relies heavily on certificates of deposit time deposits as its main source of funds and it needs to pay competitive interest rates to attract and retain deposits to fund its loan originations 
the stability of deposits as a funding source is affected by numerous factors  including returns available to our depositors on alternative investments  safety and fdic insurance limits  the quality of our customer service and other competitive forces 
at december   inb had cash and short term investments totaling million and commitments to lend of million  most of which are anticipated to be funded over the next months from the sources of funds described below 
credit lines 
at december   inb had available collateral consisting of investment securities and certain loans that could be pledged to support additional total borrowings of approximately million from the fhlb and frb  and inb also had access to overnight unsecured lines of credit totaling million 
this total borrowing capacity of million represents an increase of million from december  at december   inb s secured lines of credit represented approximately of inb s deposits that are considered sensitive money market accounts and all certificate of deposit accounts cds  inclusive of brokered cds  maturing within one year 
in the event that any of inb s existing lines of credit were not accessible or were limited  inb could designate all or a portion of its un pledged us government agency investment securities portfolio as available for sale and sell such securities as needed to provide liquidity 
inb could also pledge additional loans as collateral to increase its borrowing capacity with the fhlb 
deposits 
in  inb experienced net deposit outflow of million  primarily attributable to the repayments of million of maturing brokered deposits and million of other cds 
inb has steadily lowered its overall deposit rates offered for its deposit products since early to encourage deposit outflow and reduce the overall size of its balance sheet 
depending on market conditions and available lending opportunities  inb may decrease the size of its balance sheet further in the near term 
inb s total deposits may decrease further from the expected repayment of its maturing brokered deposits and from the potential effects of deposit rate restrictions that have been imposed on inb as a result of its formal agreement with its primary regulator 
these restrictions described below may negatively impact inb s ability to offer competitive deposit rates in its primary deposit gathering market areas 
inb is required in the absence of obtaining a waiver from the fdic to maintain its deposit pricing at or below the national rates published by the fdic  plus basis points 
the fdic s national rate is a simple average of rates paid by us depository institutions as calculated by the fdic 
furthermore  inb is also not allowed to accept  renew or rollover brokered deposits without the prior approval of the occ  its primary regulator 
inb has not accessed the brokered deposit market since september inb expects to fund any additional deposit outflow through a portion of the cash flows from the repayments of loans and or expected calls of its agency security investments 
inb s current objective is to maintain its deposit rates at levels that are in compliance with its deposit rate restrictions while attempting to promote a stable deposit base that can be adjusted to meet its cash flow needs 

table of contents inb has historically targeted its loan to deposit ratio in a range from to 
this ratio  which stood at as of december   has been affected by current market conditions  which have caused loan payoffs to exceed new originations 
total consolidated deposits decreased to billion at december   from billion at december   primarily reflecting a million decrease in cd accounts 
at december   cds totaled billion  and checking  savings and money market accounts aggregated to million 
cds represented of total deposits and cds of  or more totaled million and included million of brokered deposits 
brokered deposits had a weighted average remaining term and stated interest rate of years and  respectively  at december   and million mature by december  at december   million  or  of total cds inclusive of brokered deposits mature within one year 
inb expects to repay its brokered deposits as they mature and to retain or replace a significant portion of its remaining maturing cds  although no assurance can be given that the deposit restrictions discussed above will not negatively impact inb s ability to retain or attract deposits in the future 
loans and securities 
at december   inb had million of its loan portfolio excluding nonaccrual loans scheduled to mature within one year 
inb expects to extend or refinance a portion of these maturing loans 
additionally  over the next twelve months  approximately million of inb s security investments could potentially be called if interest rates remain at or near current levels 
absent a need for these cash inflows  nearly all of the calls are expected to be reinvested into similar securities  with potentially lower market rates 
borrowed funds 
in  inb repaid million of its maturing fhlb advances 
at december   inb had million of fhlb advances outstanding  of which million mature in and million in inb expects to have the flexibility to either repay or replace its outstanding borrowings as they mature from the sources of funds described above

intervest bancshares corporation 
at december   ibc had cash and short term investments totaling million  of which million was available for use inclusive of million on deposit with inb 
at december   ibc had undeclared and unpaid preferred tarp dividends in arrears of million and accrued and unpaid interest of million on its outstanding trust preferred securities 
dividend and interest payment restrictions 
ibc has historically received cash dividends from inb to fund the interest payments due on ibc s trust preferred securities as well as for ibc s payment of dividends on the preferred stock 
since january  inb has suspended the declaration and payment of dividends to ibc as required by its primary regulator  the occ 
since february  ibc  as required by its primary regulator  the frb  has also suspended the declaration and payment of dividends on its capital stock and payment of interest on its trust preferred securities 
dividends in arrears are recorded as a reduction in common stockholders equity only when they are declared and payable 
the regularly scheduled interest payments on the trust preferred securities continue to be accrued for payment in the future and are recorded as interest expense in our financial statements 
the interest and preferred dividend payments referred to above can only resume at such time as both ibc and inb are permitted to do so and upon the determination that such payments are consistent with ibc s and inb s overall financial performance and capital requirements 
the deferral of interest payments does not constitute a default under the indentures governing the trust preferred securities 
if ibc misses six quarterly preferred dividend payments  whether or not consecutive  the treasury  the current holder of the preferred stock  has the right to appoint two directors to ibc s board of directors until all accrued but unpaid dividends have been paid 
as of december   ibc had missed eight consecutive preferred dividend payments 
as a consequence of missing the sixth dividend payment in the second quarter of  in april  ibc agreed with the treasury to have one or more employees of the office of financial stability ofs attend and observe ibc s and inb s full board of director meetings as well as certain meetings of committees of each board  as appropriate 

table of contents the observers participate primarily by listening to discussions and presentations in such meetings  limiting their participation to clarifying questions on materials distributed  presentations made or actions proposed or taken at such meetings 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for a further discussion of missed dividend payments 
in december  representatives of the treasury have indicated that the treasury intends to exercise the right to appoint two directors at such time as they have identified appropriate candidates

asset and liability management we have interest rate risk that arises from differences in the repricing of our assets and liabilities within a given time period 
we have never engaged in trading or hedging activities  nor invested in interest rate derivatives or entered into interest rate swaps 
the primary objective of our asset liability management strategy is to limit  within established guidelines  the adverse effect of changes in interest rates on our net interest income and capital 
in this regard  inb  whose assets represent of our consolidated assets  engages an outside consultant to prepare quarterly reports using an earnings simulation model to quantify the effects of various interest rate scenarios on inb s projected net interest and dividend income over specified periods 
these computations begin with our internally prepared gap analysis which is then further adjusted for additional assumptions regarding balance sheet growth and composition  and the pricing and repricing and maturity characteristics of inb s balance sheet 
gap analysis measures the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that mature or reprice within a given time period 
as noted in the footnotes to the gap table that follows  there are numerous assumptions that are made by us to compute the gap 
a change in any of these assumptions would materially alter the results of the gap analysis as well as the simulation analysis noted above 
an asset or liability is normally considered to be interest rate sensitive if it will reprice or mature within one year or less 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities scheduled to mature or reprice within one year 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
conversely  a gap is considered negative when the opposite is true 
in a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to increase net interest income 
in a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to increase net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income 
if the repricing of our assets and liabilities were equally flexible and moved concurrently  the impact of any increase or decrease in interest rates on our net interest income would be minimal 
a simple interest rate gap analysis by itself may not be an accurate indicator of how net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates for the following reasons 
income associated with interest earning assets and costs associated with interest bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates 
in addition  the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
callable features of certain assets and liabilities  in addition to the foregoing  may also cause actual experience to vary from the analysis 
in addition  certain assets with adjustable rates may have features generally referred to as interest rate caps and floors  which limit changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
in the event of a change in interest rates  asset prepayment and early deposit withdrawal levels also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the interest rate gap 
the amount of loan prepayments cannot be predicted with accuracy and we experience reinvestment risk associated with the investment of the resulting proceeds 
the ability of many borrowers to service their debts also may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase  and the behavior of depositors may be different from those assumed in the gap analysis 
the number of fixed rate loans in our loan portfolio has increased significantly over the last several years 
to illustrate  fixed rate loans constituted approximately of our loan portfolio at december   compared to approximately at december  we also have many loans approximately of the portfolio that have terms that call for predetermined interest rate increases at various times over the life of the loan  which may or may not be at the same magnitude as general changes in market rates 

table of contents we also have a limited number approximately of the portfolio of floating rate loans that have a floor or minimum rate that was determined in relation to prevailing market rates on the date of origination 
this floor only adjusts upwards in the event of increases in the loan s interest rate 
the table below summarizes our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december   that are scheduled to mature or reprice within the periods shown

fixed rate loans and borrowings are scheduled according to their contractual maturities 
deferred loan fees and the effect of possible loan prepayments are excluded from the analysis 
nonaccrual loans of million are also excluded from the table although some portion is earning interest or is expected to return to an interest earning status in the near term 
securities are scheduled according to the earlier of their next callable date or the date on which the interest rate on the security is scheduled to change 
nearly all have predetermined interest rate increases or steps up to a specified rate on one or more predetermined dates 
generally  the security becomes eligible for redemption by the issuer at the date of the first scheduled step up 
the net carrying value million of corporate securities that are on a cash basis of accounting are excluded from the table 
interest checking  savings and money market deposits are regarded as readily accessible withdrawable accounts and certificates of deposit are scheduled according to their contractual maturity dates 
this assumption contributes significantly to the liability sensitive position reported per the one year gap analysis 
however  if such deposits were treated differently  the one year gap would then change 
depositors may not necessarily immediately withdraw funds in the event deposit rates offered by inb did not change as quickly and uniformly as changes in general market rates 
at december   the gap analysis above indicated that our interest bearing liabilities that were scheduled to mature or reprice within one year exceeded our interest earning assets that were scheduled to mature or reprice within one year 
this one year interest rate sensitivity gap amounted to a negative million  or a negative of total assets  at december  as a result of the negative one year gap  the composition of our balance sheet at december  was considered liability sensitive  indicating that our interest bearing liabilities would generally reprice with changes in interest rates more rapidly than our interest earning assets 

table of contents based on our recent analysis of the earnings simulation model described earlier  the one year risk to our net interest and dividend income from a base case net interest and dividend income of million would be a positive for a basis point rate decrease shock and a negative for a basis point rate increase shock  while the two year cumulative risk to our net interest and dividend income from a base case cumulative net interest and dividend income of million would be a negative for a basis point rate decrease shock and a negative for a basis point rate increase shock 
the model covers a month horizon and assumes interest rate changes are gradually ramped up or down over a month horizon using various assumptions based upon a parallel yield curve shift and subsequently sustained at those levels for the remainder of the simulation horizon 
for determining the assumed rates offered on our deposit accounts in the model  we use internally developed beta factors that utilize historical data based on a five year look back period 
there can be no assurances that a sudden and substantial change in interest rates may not adversely impact our net interest and dividend income to a larger extent denoted above if interest rates on our assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent  or on the same basis  than those assumed in the model 
recent accounting standards update see note the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of this topic 
impact of inflation and changing prices our financial statements and related financial data presented in this report have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs 
because virtually all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature  changes in interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than do the effects of changes in the general rate of inflation and in prices 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
our market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in our lending  security investing  deposit taking and borrowing activities 
we do not engage in and accordingly have no risk related to trading accounts  commodities  interest rate hedges or foreign exchange 
the measurement of market risk associated with financial instruments is meaningful only when all related and offsetting on and off balance sheet transactions are aggregated  and the resulting net positions are identified 
disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments which reflect changes in market prices and rates  can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
we also actively monitor and manage our interest rate risk exposure as discussed under the caption asset and liability management
