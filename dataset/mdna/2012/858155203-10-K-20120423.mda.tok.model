we serve americas customers mainly through approximately independent and company owned dealers and we also sell directly to end use customers 
our end use customers are distributed across a broad range of industries and vertical markets including healthcare  government  financial services  higher education and technology  but no industry or vertical market individually represented more than of the americas segment revenue in each of our dealers maintains its own sales force  which is complemented by our sales representatives who work closely with our dealers throughout the selling process 
the largest independent dealer in the americas accounted for approximately of the segment s revenue in  and the five largest independent dealers collectively accounted for approximately of the segment s revenue 
in  the americas segment recorded revenue of  or of our consolidated revenue  and as of the end of the year had approximately  employees  of which approximately  related to manufacturing 
the americas office furniture industry is highly competitive  with a number of competitors offering similar categories of products 
the industry competes on a combination of insight  product performance  design  price and relationships with customers  architects and designers 
our most 
table of contents significant competitors in the us are haworth  inc  herman miller  inc  hni corporation  kimball international inc 
and knoll  inc 
together with steelcase  domestic revenue from these companies represents approximately one half of the us office furniture industry 
emea segment our emea segment serves customers in europe  the middle east and africa primarily under the steelcase brand  with an emphasis on freestanding furniture systems  storage and seating solutions 
our largest presence is in western europe  where we have the leading market share in germany  france and spain 
in  approximately of emea revenue was from western europe 
the remaining revenue was from other parts of europe  the middle east and africa 
no individual country in the emea segment represented more than of our consolidated revenue in we serve emea customers through approximately independent and company owned dealers 
in certain geographic markets  we sell directly to end use customers 
no single independent dealer in the emea segment accounted for more than of the segment s revenue in the five largest independent dealers collectively accounted for approximately of the segment s revenue in in  our emea segment recorded revenue of  or of our consolidated revenue  and as of the end of the year had approximately  employees  of which approximately  related to manufacturing 
the emea office furniture market is highly competitive and fragmented 
we compete with many local and regional manufacturers in many different markets 
in several cases  these competitors focus on specific product categories 
other category the other category includes asia pacific  polyvision and designtex 
ideo was included in the other category through q  but due to the ownership transition  our remaining share of ideo income has been recorded as a non operating item since q asia pacific serves customers in the people s republic of china including hong kong  australia  india  japan and other countries in southeast asia  primarily under the steelcase brand with an emphasis on furniture systems and seating solutions 
we sell through company owned and independent dealers to end use customers 
our end use customers are larger multinational or regional companies spread across a broad range of industries and are located in both established and emerging markets 
our competition includes all the large global competitors as well as many local and regional manufactures 
polyvision designs and distributes visual communication products  such as interactive electronic whiteboards 
polyvision also manufactures steel and ceramic surfaces for use in multiple applications  but primarily for sale to third party fabricators to create static whiteboards sold in the primary and secondary education markets in the us and europe 
designtex primarily sells textiles and wall covering products specified by architects and designers directly to end use customers through a direct sales force primarily in north america 
in  the other category accounted for  or of our consolidated revenue  and as of the end of the year had approximately  employees  of which approximately related to manufacturing 

table of contents corporate corporate costs include portions of shared service functions such as information technology  human resources  finance  executive  corporate facilities  legal and research 
approximately of corporate expenses were charged to the operating segments in as part of a corporate allocation 
unallocated corporate expenses are reported as corporate 
joint ventures and other equity investments we enter into joint ventures and other equity investments from time to time to expand or maintain our geographic presence  support our distribution network or invest in complementary products and services 
as of february   our investment in these unconsolidated joint ventures and other equity investments totaled our share of the earnings from joint ventures and other equity investments is recorded in other income expense  net on the consolidated statements of operations 
customer and dealer concentrations our largest direct sale customer accounted for of our consolidated revenue in  and our five largest direct sale customers collectively accounted for of our consolidated revenue 
however  these percentages do not include revenue from various government agencies 
in aggregate  entities purchasing under our us general services administration contract collectively accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenue 
we do not believe our business is dependent on any single or small number of end use customers  the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business 
no single independent dealer accounted for more than of our consolidated revenue in the five largest independent dealers collectively accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenue 
we do not believe our business is dependent on any single dealer  the loss of which would have a sustained material adverse effect upon our business 
working capital our accounts receivable are from our dealers and direct sale customers 
payment terms vary by country and region 
the terms of our americas segment  and certain markets within the emea segment  encourage prompt payment from dealers by offering an early settlement discount 
other international markets have  by market convention  longer payment terms 
we are not aware of any special or unusual practices or conditions related to working capital items  including accounts receivable  inventory and accounts payable  which are significant to understanding our business or the industry at large 
backlog our products are generally manufactured and shipped within two to six weeks following receipt of order  therefore  we do not view the amount of backlog at any particular time as a meaningful indicator of longer term shipments 
global manufacturing and supply chain manufacturing and logistics we have manufacturing operations throughout north america principally in the united states and mexico  europe principally in france  germany and spain and asia principally in china and 
table of contents malaysia 
we are in the process of localizing production of certain products and establishing the corresponding supply chain in india to serve that market 
this initial effort will be completed during with the ability to add more products as needed 
our manufacturing model is predominately make to order with lead times typically ranging from two to six weeks 
we manufacture our products using lean manufacturing principles  which allow us to maintain efficiencies and cost savings by minimizing the amount of inventory on hand 
as a result  we purchase direct materials and components as needed to meet demand 
we have evolved our manufacturing and supply chain systems significantly over the past several years by implementing continuous one piece flow  platforming our processes and product offerings and developing a global network of integrated suppliers 
any operation which cannot be part of one piece flow may be evaluated to see whether outside partners would offer better levels of service  quality and cost 
our global manufacturing operations are centralized under a single organization to serve our customers needs across multiple brands and geographies 
this approach has reduced the capital needs of our business  inventory levels and the footprint of our manufacturing space  while at the same time  allowing us to improve quality  delivery performance and the customer experience 
we continue to identify opportunities to improve the fitness of our business and strengthen our long term competitiveness 
in  we substantially completed a project to reorganize our european manufacturing operations  and we announced the planned closure of three additional manufacturing facilities in north america 
we are in the process of moving production within these three facilities to other steelcase locations in north america and expect to complete these moves by the end of q in addition to our ongoing focus on enhancing the efficiency of our manufacturing operations  we also seek to reduce costs through our global sourcing effort 
we have capitalized on raw material and component cost savings available through lower cost suppliers around the globe 
this global view of potential sources of supply has enhanced our leverage with domestic supply sources  and we have been able to reduce cycle times through improvements with our partners throughout the supply chain 
our physical distribution system utilizes commercial transport  company owned and dedicated fleet delivery services 
we have implemented a network of regional distribution centers to reduce freight costs and improve service to our dealers and customers 
some of these distribution centers are located within our manufacturing facilities  and we have engaged third party logistics providers to operate most of these regional distribution centers 
raw materials we source raw materials and components from a significant number of suppliers around the world 
those raw materials include petroleum based products  steel  other metals  wood  particleboard and other materials and components 
to date  we have not experienced any significant difficulties in obtaining these raw materials 
the prices for certain commodities such as steel  aluminum and other metals  wood  particleboard and petroleum based products have fluctuated significantly in recent years due to changes in global supply and demand 
our global supply chain team continually evaluates current market conditions  the financial viability of our suppliers and available supply options on the basis of cost  quality and reliability of supply 
research  design and development our extensive global research a combination of user observations  feedback sessions and sophisticated analysis has helped us develop social  spatial and informational insights into work 
table of contents effectiveness 
we maintain collaborative relationships with external world class innovators  including leading universities  think tanks and knowledge leaders  to expand and deepen our understanding of how people work 
understanding patterns of work enables us to identify and anticipate user needs across the globe 
our design teams explore and develop prototypical solutions to address these needs 
these solutions vary from furniture  architecture and technology solutions to single products or enhancements to existing products  and across different vertical market applications such as healthcare  higher education and professional services 
organizationally  global design leadership directs strategy and project work  which is distributed to design studios across our major businesses and often involves external design services 
our marketing team evaluates product concepts using several criteria  including financial return metrics  and chooses which products will be developed and launched 
designers then work closely with engineers and suppliers to co develop products and processes that incorporate innovative user features with efficient manufacturing practices 
products are tested for performance  quality and compliance with applicable standards and regulations 
exclusive of royalty payments  we invested  and in research  design and development activities in  and  respectively 
we continue to invest approximately one to two percent of our revenue in research  design and development each year 
royalties are sometimes paid to external designers of our products as the products are sold 
these costs are not included in research and development expenses 
intellectual property we generate and hold a significant number of patents in a number of countries in connection with the operation of our business 
we also hold a number of trademarks that are very important to our identity and recognition in the marketplace 
we do not believe that any material part of our business is dependent on the continued availability of any one or all of our patents or trademarks or that our business would be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of such  except the steelcase  coalesse  polyvision  designtex  details  turnstone  and nurture by steelcase trademarks 
we occasionally enter into license agreements under which we pay a royalty to third parties for the use of patented products  designs or process technology 
we have established a global network of intellectual property licenses with our subsidiaries 
employees as of february   we had approximately  employees  including  hourly employees and  salaried employees 
additionally  we had approximately  temporary workers who primarily work in manufacturing 
approximately employees in the us are covered by collective bargaining agreements 
internationally   employees are represented by workers councils that operate to promote the interests of workers 
management promotes positive relations with employees based on empowerment and teamwork 
environmental matters we are subject to a variety of federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment environmental laws 
we believe our operations are in substantial compliance with all environmental laws 
we do not believe existing environmental laws and regulations have had or will have any material effects upon our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position 

table of contents under certain environmental laws  we could be held liable  without regard to fault  for the costs of remediation associated with our existing or historical operations 
we could also be held responsible for third party property and personal injury claims or for violations of environmental laws relating to contamination 
we are a party to  or otherwise involved in  proceedings relating to several contaminated properties being investigated and remediated under environmental laws  including as a potentially responsible party in several superfund site cleanups 
based on our information regarding the nature and volume of wastes allegedly disposed of or released at these properties  the total estimated cleanup costs and other financially viable potentially responsible parties  we do not believe the costs to us associated with these properties will be material  either individually or in the aggregate 
we have established reserves that we believe are adequate to cover our anticipated remediation costs 
however  certain events could cause our actual costs to vary from the established reserves 
these events include  but are not limited to a change in governmental regulations or cleanup standards or requirements  undiscovered information regarding the nature and volume of wastes allegedly disposed of or released at these properties  and other factors increasing the cost of remediation or the loss of other potentially responsible parties that are financially capable of contributing toward cleanup costs

item a 
risk factors the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form k should be carefully considered 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties that we do not know about currently  or that we currently believe are less significant  may also adversely affect our business  operating results  cash flows and financial condition 
if any of these risks actually occur  our business  operating results  cash flows and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
our industry is influenced significantly by cyclical macroeconomic factors which are difficult to predict 
our revenue is generated predominantly from the office furniture industry  and demand for office furniture is influenced heavily by a variety of macroeconomic factors  such as corporate profits  
table of contents non residential fixed investment  white collar employment and commercial office construction and vacancy rates 
in recent history  the us office furniture industry has gone through two major downturns  with consumption declining by more than from calendar year to and again from to  according to the business and institutional furniture manufacturer s association 
during these downturns  our revenue declined in similar proportion and our profitability was significantly reduced 
we have made a number of changes to adapt our business model to these cycles  but our profitability could be impacted in the future by cyclical downturns 
in addition  the pace of industry recovery after a cyclical downturn may vary  including by geography or vertical market 
these macroeconomic factors are difficult to predict  and if we are unsuccessful in adapting our business as economic cyclical changes occur  our results may be adversely affected 
failure to respond to changes in workplace trends and the competitive landscape may adversely affect our revenue and profits 
advances in technology  the globalization of business  changing workforce demographics and shifts in work styles and behaviors are changing the world of work and may have a significant impact on the types of workplace products and services purchased by our customers and the geographic location of the demand 
for example  in recent years  these trends have resulted in a reduction in the amount of office floor space allocated per employee  a reduction in size and price of a typical workstation and an increase in work occurring in more collaborative settings and a variety of locations beyond the traditional office 
the confluence of these factors could attract new competitors from outside the traditional office furniture industry offering products and services which compete with those offered by us and our dealers 
in addition  the traditional office furniture industry is highly competitive  with a number of competitors offering similar categories of products 
we compete on a variety of factors  including brand recognition and reputation  insight from our research  product design and features  price  lead time  delivery and service  product quality  strength of dealers and other distributors and relationships with customers and key influencers  such as architects  designers and facility managers 
if we are unsuccessful in developing and offering products and services which respond to changes in workplace trends  or we or our dealers are unsuccessful in competing with existing competitors and new competitive offerings which could arise from outside our industry  our revenue and profits may be adversely affected 
we may not be able to successfully develop  implement and manage our diversification and growth strategies 
our longer term success depends on our ability to successfully develop  implement and manage strategies that will preserve our position as the world s largest office furniture manufacturer  as well as expand our offerings into adjacent and emerging markets 
in particular  our diversification and growth strategies include translating our research regarding the world of work into innovative solutions which address market needs  continuing our expansion into adjacent markets such as smaller companies  healthcare clinical spaces and classrooms  growing our market share in emerging markets such as china  india  africa and the middle east  investing in acquisitions and new business ventures and developing new alliances and additional channels of distribution 
if these strategies to diversify and increase our revenues are not sufficient  or if we do not execute these strategies successfully  our results of operations may be adversely affected 

table of contents we have been and expect to continue making investments in strategic growth initiatives and new product development 
if our return on these investments is lower  or develops more slowly  than we anticipate  the results of our operations may be adversely affected 
we may be adversely affected by changes in raw material and commodity costs 
we procure raw materials including steel  aluminum  other metals  wood  particleboard and petroleum based products from a significant number of sources globally 
these raw materials are not rare or unique to our industry 
the costs of these commodities  as well as fuel and energy costs  have fluctuated significantly in recent years due to changes in global supply and demand  which can also cause supply interruptions 
in the short term  rapid increases in raw material and commodity costs can be very difficult to offset with price increases because of existing contractual commitments with our customers  and it is difficult to find effective financial instruments to hedge against such changes 
as a result  our gross margins can be adversely affected by short term fluctuations in these costs 
also  if we are not successful in passing along higher raw material and commodity costs to our customers over the longer term because of competitive pressures  our profitability could be negatively impacted 
our global presence subjects us to risks that may negatively affect our profitability and financial condition 
we have manufacturing facilities and sales  administrative and shared services offices in many countries  and as a result  we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally 
our success depends on our ability to manage the complexity associated with designing  developing  manufacturing and selling our solutions in a variety of countries 
our global presence is also subject to market risks  which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition  including differing business practices  cultural factors and regulatory requirements  fluctuations in currency exchange rates and currency controls  political  social and economic instability  natural disasters  security concerns  including terrorist activity  armed conflict and civil or military unrest  and global health issues and intellectual property protection challenges 
our continuing efforts to improve our business model could result in additional restructuring costs and may result in customer disruption 
over the past decade  we have implemented significant restructuring actions to transform our business through the reinvention of our industrial system and white collar processes 
while we believe we have made significant progress  we continue to evolve and optimize our business model to be more flexible and agile in meeting changing demand  and incremental restructuring actions may be necessary 
the success of our restructuring initiatives is dependent on several factors  including our ability to manage these actions without disrupting existing customer commitments 
further  these actions may take longer than anticipated and may distract management from other activities  and we may not fully realize the expected benefits of our restructuring activities  either of which would have a negative impact on our results of operations 

table of contents we are increasingly reliant on a global network of suppliers 
our migration to a less vertically integrated manufacturing model has increased our dependency on a global network of suppliers 
we are reliant on the timely flow of raw materials  components and finished goods from third party suppliers 
the flow of such materials  components and goods may be affected by fluctuations in the availability and quality of raw materials  the financial solvency of our suppliers and their supply chains  disruptions caused by labor activities and damage and loss of production from accidents  natural disasters and other causes 
any disruptions in the supply and delivery of raw materials  component parts and finished goods or deficiencies in our ability to manage our global network of suppliers could have an adverse impact on our business  operating results or financial condition 
disruptions within our dealer network could adversely affect our business 
we rely largely on a network of approximately independent and company owned dealers to market  deliver and install our products to customers 
from time to time  we or a dealer may choose to terminate our relationship  or the dealer could face financial insolvency or difficulty in transitioning to new ownership 
our business is influenced by our ability to initiate and manage new and existing relationships with dealers  and establishing new dealers in a market can take considerable time and resources 
disruption of dealer coverage within a specific local market could have an adverse impact on our business within the affected market 
the loss or termination of a significant number of dealers or the inability to establish new dealers could cause difficulties in marketing and distributing our products and have an adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
in the event that a dealer in a strategic market experiences financial difficulty  we may choose to make financial investments in the dealership which would reduce the risk of disruption but increase our financial exposure 
we may be required to record impairment charges related to goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets which would adversely affect our results of operations 
goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist 
poor performance in portions of our business where we have goodwill or intangible assets  or declines in the market value of our equity  may result in impairment charges  which would adversely affect our profitability 
there may be significant limitations to our utilization of net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income 
we have deferred tax asset values related to net operating loss carryforwards nols totaling which reside primarily in various non us jurisdictions and reflect a valuation allowance 
we may be unable to generate sufficient taxable income from future operations in the applicable jurisdiction or implement tax  business or other planning strategies to fully utilize the estimated value of our nols 
we have nols in various currencies that are also subject to foreign exchange risk  which could reduce the amount we may ultimately realize 
additionally  future changes in tax laws or interpretations of such tax laws may limit our ability to fully utilize our nols

the variable life coli income previously included in operating income is excluded for comparative purposes 
overview during  we experienced organic revenue growth compared to the prior year  including organic revenue growth in the americas 
this growth is better than global trends in our industry 
companies have been increasing corporate spending thus far in the economic recovery  leveraging the strength of their cash positions 
during the second half of  white collar employment and new construction traditional industry drivers started to modestly improve in the americas  but the broader economic recovery remains challenged by a variety of headwinds  including the ongoing sentiment surrounding european sovereign debt 
additionally  we believe many of our customers have deferred spending during a decade in which various forces have dramatically impacted their work environments  and many are at the point where they are now investing to address these impacts 
we have been conducting research and launching new products  applications and experiences over the past several years to address these forces  some of which include globalization trends  miniaturization of technology  mobility of workers  increased collaboration and multi generations at work 
we believe staying invested in these growth initiatives during the worst of the recession helped drive our strong revenue growth as our customers increased spending 
during the second half of  we increased investments in product development and other initiatives 
we believe these investments will strengthen our market leadership and help to sustain the momentum we have in our business 
beyond our revenue growth  in we also took a number of steps to improve our operating fitness and organize our business as a globally integrated enterprise  which included implementation of a number of restructuring actions  both in north america and europe 
these actions are expected to reduce our operating costs in future periods 
compared to we recorded net income of in compared to in the increase in net income was driven by higher operating income in the americas and asia pacific and lower income tax expense  but partially offset by lower operating income due to the ideo ownership transition  higher interest expense and lower variable life coli income

critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
although these estimates are based on historical data and management s knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future  actual results may differ from the estimates if different conditions occur 
the accounting estimates that typically involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity are listed and explained below 
these estimates were discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors and affect all segments of the company 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price and the related underlying tangible and identifiable intangible net asset values resulting from business acquisitions 
annually in q  or earlier if conditions indicate it is necessary  the carrying value of the reporting unit is compared to an estimate of its fair value 
if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value  goodwill is impaired and is written down to its estimated fair value 
goodwill is assigned to and the fair value is tested at the reporting unit level 
we evaluated goodwill and intangible assets using six reporting units where goodwill is recorded americas and coalesse within the americas reportable segment  emea  asia pacific  and designtex and polyvision within the other category 
annually in q  or earlier if conditions indicate it is necessary  we also perform an impairment analysis of our intangible assets not subject to amortization using an income approach based on the cash flows attributable to the related products 
we also perform an impairment analysis of our intangible assets subject to amortization during interim periods upon the occurrence of certain events or changes in circumstance 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of a long lived 
table of contents asset exceeds its fair value 
in testing for impairment  we first determine if the asset is recoverable and then compare the discounted cash flows over the asset s remaining life to the carrying value 
as of february   we had of goodwill and of net intangible assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as follows reportable segment goodwill other intangible assets  net americas emea other category total during q  we performed our annual impairment assessment of goodwill in our reporting units 
in the first step to test for potential impairment  we measured the estimated fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow valuation dcf method and reconciled the fair value of our reporting units to the sum of our total market capitalization plus a control premium our adjusted market capitalization 
the control premium represents an estimate associated with obtaining control of the company in an acquisition of the outstanding shares of class a common stock and class b common stock 
the dcf analysis used the present value of projected cash flows and a residual value 
considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating changes and to estimate future cash flows in measuring fair value 
assumptions used in our impairment valuations  such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital  are consistent with our current internal projections 
as part of the reconciliation to our adjusted market capitalization  we made adjustments to the estimated future cash flows  as well as the discount rates used in calculating the estimated fair value of the reporting units 
the discount rates ranged from to 
due to the subjective nature of this reconciliation process  these assumptions could change over time  which may result in future impairment charges 
as of the valuation date  the enterprise value available for goodwill determined as described above is in excess of the underlying reported value of goodwill as follows reportable segment enterprise value available in excess of goodwill americas emea other category for each reporting unit  the excess enterprise value available for goodwill is primarily driven by the residual value of future years 
thus  increasing the discount rate by  leaving all other assumptions unchanged  would reduce the enterprise value in excess of goodwill to the following amounts reportable segment enterprise value available in excess of goodwill americas emea other category based on the sensitivity analysis above  no reporting units would have had goodwill balances in excess of enterprise value available for goodwill as of the valuation date

income taxes our annual effective tax rate is based on income  statutory tax rates and tax planning strategies in various jurisdictions in which we operate 
tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities 
significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating tax positions 
tax positions are reviewed quarterly and balances are adjusted as new information becomes available 
we are audited by the us internal revenue service under the compliance assurance process cap 
under cap  the us internal revenue service works with large business taxpayers to identify and resolve issues prior to the filing of a tax return 
accordingly  we expect to record minimal liabilities for us federal uncertain tax positions 
tax positions are reviewed regularly for state  local and non us tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions 
our liability for uncertain tax positions in these jurisdictions is deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
these assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse 
in evaluating our ability to recover deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise  we consider all positive and negative evidence 
these assumptions require significant judgment and are developed using forecasts of future taxable income that are consistent with the internal plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business 
future tax benefits of tax loss and credit carryforwards are recognized to the extent that realization of these benefits is considered more likely than not 
as of february   we recorded tax benefits from the operating loss carryforwards of  but we have also recorded valuation allowances totaling  which reduced our realized tax benefit to additionally  we have recognized tax benefits from tax credit carryforwards of it is considered more likely than not that a combined cash benefit of will be realized on these carryforwards in future periods 
this determination is based on the expectation that related operations will be sufficiently profitable or various tax  business and other planning strategies will enable us to utilize the carryforwards 
to the extent that available evidence raises doubt about the realization of a deferred tax asset  a valuation allowance is established or adjusted 
as of february   we have recorded partial valuation allowances totaling on certain net operating loss carryforwards totaling these carryforward benefits relate to jurisdictions that allow indefinite carryforward periods and in which we have reported cumulative losses in the most recent three years 
our judgment regarding the utilization of these net operating losses is based on our conclusion that we have sufficient evidence that it is more likely than not that we will generate future taxable income in these jurisdictions 
the key factors that we considered in our analysis included the impact of restructuring activities and tax planning strategies  as well as the impact of the cyclical nature of our business on future sales levels 
our judgment related to the realization of the deferred tax assets is based on current and expected market conditions and could change in the event market conditions and our profitability in these jurisdictions differ significantly from our current estimates 
a decrease in the expected amount of cash benefit to be realized on the carryforwards would have resulted in a decrease in net income for of approximately

pension and other post retirement benefits the company sponsors a number of domestic and foreign plans to provide pension  medical and life insurance benefits to retired employees 
as of february  and february   the benefit obligations  fair value of plan assets and funded status of these plans are as follows defined benefit pension plans post retirement plans february  february  february  february  benefit plan obligations fair value of plan assets funded status the post retirement medical and life insurance plans are unfunded  but our investments in whole life coli policies are intended to be utilized as a long term funding source for these benefit obligations 
the asset values of the whole life coli policies are not segregated in a trust specifically for the plans  thus are not considered plan assets 
changes in the values of these policies have no effect on the post retirement benefits expense or benefit obligations recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
as of february   approximately of our unfunded defined benefit pension obligations related to our non qualified supplemental retirement plan that is limited to a select group of management approved by the compensation committee 
this plan is unfunded  but our investments in whole life coli policies are intended to be utilized as a long term funding source for these benefit obligations 
the asset values of the whole life coli policies are not segregated in a trust specifically for the plan  thus are not considered plan assets 
changes in the values of these policies have no effect on the defined benefit pension expense or benefit obligations recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
we recognize the cost of benefits provided during retirement over the employees active working lives 
inherent in this approach is the requirement to use various actuarial assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement date 
key actuarial assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our consolidated benefits expense and benefit obligations include  among others  the discount rate and health cost trend rates 
these assumptions are reviewed with our actuaries and updated annually based on relevant external and internal factors and information  including  but not limited to  benefit payments  expenses paid from the fund  rates of termination  medical inflation  technology and quality care changes  regulatory requirements  plan changes and governmental coverage changes 
to conduct our annual review of discount rates  we perform a matching exercise of projected plan cash flows against spot rates on a yield curve comprised of high quality corporate bonds as of the measurement date ryan alm curve with a primary focus for our domestic plans 
the measurement dates for our retiree benefit plans are consistent with our fiscal year end 
accordingly  we select discount rates to measure our benefit obligations that are consistent with market indices at the end of each fiscal year 

table of contents based on consolidated benefit obligations as of february   a one percentage point decline in the weighted average discount rate used for benefit plan measurement purposes would have changed the consolidated benefits expense by less than and changed the consolidated benefit obligations by less than all obligation related experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight line method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants 
to conduct our annual review of healthcare cost trend rates  we model our actual claims cost data over a historical period  including an analysis of pre versus post age groups and other important demographic components of our covered retiree population 
this data is adjusted to eliminate the impact of plan changes and other factors that would tend to distort the underlying cost inflation trends 
our initial healthcare cost trend rate is reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with recent historical experience and our expectations regarding short term future trends 
as of february   our initial rates of for pre age retirees and for post age retirees were trended downward by each year  until the ultimate trend rate of is reached 
the ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually  as necessary  to approximate the current economic view on the rate of long term inflation plus an appropriate healthcare cost premium 
based on consolidated benefit obligations as of february   a one percentage point increase or decrease in the assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have changed the consolidated benefits expense by less than and changed the consolidated benefit obligations by less than all experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight line method  over at least the minimum amortization period prescribed by accounting guidance 
despite the previously described policies for selecting key actuarial assumptions  we periodically experience material differences between assumed and actual experience 
as of february   we had consolidated unamortized prior service credits and net experience gains of  as compared to as of february   recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the consolidated balance sheets

forward looking statements from time to time  in written and oral statements  we discuss our expectations regarding future events and our plans and objectives for future operations 
these forward looking statements discuss goals  intentions and expectations as to future trends  plans  events  results of operations or financial condition  or state other information relating to us  based on current beliefs of management as well as assumptions made by  and information currently available to  us 
forward looking statements generally are accompanied by words such as anticipate  believe  could  estimate  expect  forecast  intend  may  possible  potential  predict  project  or other similar words  phrases or expressions 
although we believe these forward looking statements are reasonable  they are based upon a number of assumptions concerning future conditions  any or all of which may ultimately prove to be inaccurate 
forward looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to vary from our expectations because of factors such as  but not limited to  competitive and general economic conditions domestically and internationally  acts of terrorism  war  governmental action  natural disasters and other force majeure events  changes in the legal and regulatory environment  our restructuring activities  changes in raw materials and commodity costs  currency fluctuations  changes in customer demands  and the other risks and contingencies detailed in this report and our other filings with the securities and exchange commission

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks from foreign currency exchange  interest rates  commodity prices and fixed income and equity prices  which could affect our operating results  financial position and cash flows 
foreign currency exchange risk we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily on sales commitments  anticipated sales and purchases and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
in both and  we transacted business in primary currencies worldwide  of which the most significant were the euro  the canadian dollar and the pound sterling 
revenue from foreign locations represented approximately of our consolidated revenue in  in and in we actively manage the foreign currency exposures that are associated with committed foreign currency purchases and sales created in the normal course of business at the local entity level 
exposures that cannot be naturally offset within a local entity to an immaterial amount are often hedged with foreign currency derivatives or netted with offsetting exposures at other entities 
our results are affected by the strength of the currencies in countries where we manufacture or purchase goods relative to the strength of the currencies in countries where our products are sold 
we estimate that an additional strengthening of the us dollar against local currencies would have decreased operating income by approximately in both and  assuming no changes other than the exchange rate itself 
however  this quantitative measure has inherent limitations 
the sensitivity analysis disregards the possibility that rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one currency may or may not be offset by losses from another currency 
the translation of the assets and liabilities of our international subsidiaries is made using the foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of the fiscal year 
translation adjustments are not included in determining net income but are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss within shareholders equity on the consolidated balance sheets until a sale or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in the international subsidiary takes place 
in certain markets  we could recognize a significant gain or loss related to unrealized cumulative translation adjustments if we were to exit the market and liquidate our net investment 
as of february  and february   the cumulative net currency translation adjustments reduced shareholders equity by and  respectively 
foreign currency exchange gains and losses reflect transaction gains and losses  which arise from monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than a business unit s functional currency

interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily on our short term and long term investments and short term and long term borrowings 
our short term investments are primarily invested in us agency debt securities  us government debt securities and corporate debt securities 
additionally we held investments in auction rate securities and canadian par asset backed commercial 
table of contents paper restructuring notes as of february  and february   which are classified as long term investments as no liquid markets currently exist for these securities 
the risk on our short term and long term borrowings is primarily related to a loan with a balance of and as of february  and february   respectively 
this loan bears a floating interest rate based on day libor plus 
we estimate a increase in interest rates would have increased our results of operations by approximately in and would not have had a material impact in  mainly as a result of higher interest income on our investments 
significant changes in interest rates could have an impact on the market value of our managed fixed income investment portfolio 
however  this quantitative measure has inherent limitations since not all of our investments are in similar asset classes 
in addition  our investment manager actively manages certain investments  thus our results could be better or worse than market returns 
as of february   approximately of our fixed income investments mature within one year  approximately in two years and approximately in three to five years 
see note and note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
commodity price risk we are exposed to commodity price risk primarily on our raw materials inventory 
these raw materials are not rare or unique to our industry 
the cost of steel  aluminum  other metals  wood  particleboard  petroleum based products and other commodities  such as fuel and energy  has fluctuated significantly in recent years due to changes in global supply and demand 
our gross margins could be affected if these types of costs continue to fluctuate 
we actively manage these raw material costs through global sourcing initiatives and price increases on our products 
however  in the short term  rapid increases in raw material costs can be very difficult to offset with price increases because of contractual agreements with our customers  and it is difficult to find effective financial instruments to hedge against such changes 
as a result of changes in commodity costs  cost of sales increased approximately and during and  respectively 
the increase in commodity costs during was driven primarily by higher steel and fuel costs 
we estimate that a increase in commodity prices  assuming no offsetting benefit of price increases  would have decreased our operating income by approximately and in and  respectively 
fixed income and equity price risk we are exposed to fixed income and equity price risk primarily on the cash surrender value associated with our investments in variable life coli policies 
during  our results of operations were significantly impacted by coli income related to our investments in variable life coli policies 
we recognized non taxable income of in related to variable life coli income in operating income on the consolidated statements of operations 
in q  we began considering our investments in variable life coli policies to be primarily a source of corporate liquidity 
accordingly  we set the allocation of our investments in variable life coli policies to a more conservative profile with a heavier weighting to fixed income securities  and we began recognizing variable life coli income in investment income on the consolidated statements of operations 
in q  we further revised the allocation of our investments in variable life coli policies to include only fixed income securities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
we estimate a adverse change in the value of the equity portion of our variable life coli investments would have reduced our net income by approximately in both and we 
table of contents estimate that the risk of changes in the value of the variable life coli investments due to other factors  including changes in interest rates  yield curve and portfolio duration  would not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
this quantitative measure has inherent limitations since not all of our investments are in similar asset classes
