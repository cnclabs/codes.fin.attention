item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and our financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements included in this discussion as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  those discussed in risk factors and information regarding forward looking statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
general 
we provide software based computer enabled detection ced products and solutions that use advanced signal processing software algorithms to detect and monitor objects in a designated field of view 
our technology analyzes signals from a sophisticated sensor and passes the information along to management systems  controllers or directly to users 
our core products  the autoscope video vehicle detection system  rtms radar detection system and citysync automatic number plate recognition anpr system  operate using our proprietary application software in conjunction with video cameras or radar and commonly available electronic components 
our systems are used by traffic managers primarily to improve the flow of vehicle traffic and to enhance safety at intersections  main thoroughfares  freeways and tunnels and by parking and toll managers and law enforcement officials to read license plates for various safety  security  access and enforcement anpr applications 
autoscope systems are sold to distributors and end users of traffic management products in north america  the caribbean and latin america by econolite control products  inc econolite  our exclusive licensee in these regions 
we sell citysync systems to distributors and end users in north america 
as described below  we announced a change to our rtms selling model in december we sell all of our systems to distributors and end users in europe and asia through our european and hong kong subsidiaries  respectively 
the majority of our sales are to end users that are funded by government agencies responsible for traffic management or traffic law enforcement 
citysync acquisition 
in june  we purchased all of the outstanding equity of citysync limited through which we own its principal product line  the citysync anpr system 
we believe the citysync acquisition expands our addressable market  strengthens our selling presence in europe and extends our opportunities for hybrid product developments 
in its fiscal year ended january   citysync had revenue of million  substantially all of which related to anpr system sales 
rtms business model change and restructuring 
in december  we announced certain changes to our rtms business model 
beginning in  we gave an exclusive license to manufacture and distribute rtms products in north america to econolite under terms substantially the same as our autoscope royalty arrangement 
in conjunction with this agreement  certain of our sales and marketing employees dedicated to rtms are now employed directly by econolite 
as a result  in  revenue earned from sales of rtms in north america will be in the form of a royalty rather than a sale directly to the purchaser  and there will be no cost of revenue  as econolite will now be responsible for manufacturing and post sales support 
additionally  our sales and marketing expense related to our rtms business in north america will be significantly decreased due to the transition of the former headcount 
simultaneously with the rtms changes  we put a plan in place for restructuring aspects of our north american rtms and citysync businesses 
most significantly  the assembly of our rtms product is being moved from our toronto facility to a third party  and our production and administrative support headcount will be reduced early in trends and challenges in our business we believe the growth in our business can be attributed primarily to the following global trends worsening traffic caused by increased numbers of vehicles in metropolitan areas without corresponding expansions of road infrastructure and the need to automate safety  security and access applications for automobiles and trucks  which has increased demand for our products  advances in information technology  which have made our products easier to market and implement  the continued funding allocations for centralized traffic management services and automated enforcement schemes  which has increased the ability of our primary end users to implement our products  and general increases in the cost effectiveness of electronics  which make our products more affordable for end users 

table of contents we believe our continued growth primarily depends upon continued adoption and governmental funding of intelligent transportation systems its and other automated applications for traffic control  safety and enforcement in developed countries  a propensity by traffic engineers to implement lower cost technology based solutions rather than civil engineering solutions such as widening roadways  countries in the developing world adopting above ground detection technology  such as video or radar  instead of in pavement loop technology to manage traffic  the use of ced to provide solutions to security surveillance and environmental issues associated with increasing automobile use in metropolitan areas  and our ability to develop new products  such as hybrid ced devices incorporating  for example  radar and video technologies  that provide increasingly accurate information and enhance the end users ability to cost effectively manage traffic  security surveillance and environmental issues 
because the majority of our end users are governmental entities  we are faced with challenges related to potential delays in purchase decisions by those entities and changes in budgetary constraints 
these contingencies could result in significant fluctuations in our revenue between periods 
the current european sovereign debt crisis is further adding to the unpredictability of purchase decisions  creating more delays than usual and decreasing governmental budgets  and it is likely to continue to negatively affect our revenue 
key financial terms and metrics revenue 
we derive revenue from two sources royalties received from econolite for sales of the autoscope system in north america  the caribbean and latin america and revenue received from the direct sales of our rtms and citysync systems in north america  the caribbean and latin america and all of our systems in europe and asia 
as described above  beginning in  rtms sales in north america will become royalty based 
we calculate the royalties using a profit sharing model where the gross profit on sales of autoscope product made through econolite are shared equally with econolite 
this royalty arrangement has the benefit of decreasing our cost of revenues and our selling  marketing and product support expenses because these costs and expenses are borne primarily by econolite 
although this royalty model has a positive impact on our gross margin  it also negatively impacts our total revenue  which would be higher if all the sales made by econolite were made directly by us 
the royalty arrangement is exclusive under a long term agreement 
cost of revenue 
there is no cost of revenue related to royalties  as virtually all manufacturing  warranty and related costs are incurred by econolite 
cost of revenue related to product sales consists primarily of the amount charged by our third party contractors to manufacture hardware platforms  which is influenced mainly by the cost of electronic components 
the cost of revenue also includes logistics costs  estimated expenses for product warranties  restructuring costs and inventory reserves 
the key metric that we follow is achieving certain gross margin percentages by geographic region and to a lesser extent by product line 
operating expenses 
our operating expenses fall into three categories selling  marketing and product support  general and administrative  and research and development 
selling  marketing and product support expenses consist of various costs related to sales and support of our products  including salaries  benefits and commissions paid to our personnel  commissions paid to third parties  travel  trade show and advertising costs  second tier technical support for econolite  and general product support  where applicable 
general and administrative expenses consist of certain corporate and administrative functions that support the development and sales of our products and provide an infrastructure to support future growth 
general and administrative expenses reflect management  supervisory and staff salaries and benefits  legal and auditing fees  travel  rent and costs associated with being a public company  such as board of director fees  listing fees and annual reporting expenses 
research and development expenses consist mainly of salaries and benefits for our engineers and third party costs for consulting and prototyping 
we measure all operating expenses against our annually approved budget  which is developed with achieving a certain operating margin as a key focus 
also included in operating expenses are acquisition related expenses  income related to the earn out reversal  impairment charges  restructuring costs and non cash expense for intangible asset amortization 
non gaap operating measure 
we use non gaap net income to analyze our business 
non gaap net income excludes the impact  net of tax  of restructuring charges  amortizing the intangible assets and expenses related to acquisitions  including earn out adjustments 
non gaap net income also excludes the impact  net of tax  of restructuring and goodwill impairment charges 
management believes that this non gaap operating measure  when shown in conjunction with gaap measures  facilitates the comparison of our current operating results to historical operating results 
we use this non gaap information to evaluate short term and long term operating trends in our core operations 
further  we believe that this non gaap measure improves management s and investors ability to compare our financial performance with other companies in the technology industry 
non gaap information is not prepared in accordance with gaap and should not be considered a substitute for or an alternative to gaap financial measures and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies 

table of contents reconciliations of gaap net income to non gaap net income are as follows dollars in thousands  except per share amounts years ended december gaap net income loss adjustments to reconcile to non gaap net income amortization of intangible assets goodwill impairment acquisition related expenses income restructuring non recurring foreign tax benefit impact on income tax expense benefit of excluded items non gaap net income gaap diluted earnings loss per share non gaap diluted earnings per share seasonality 
our quarterly revenues and operating results have varied significantly in the past due to the seasonality of our business 
our first quarter generally is the weakest due to weather conditions that make roadway construction more difficult in parts of north america  europe and northern asia 
we expect such seasonality to continue for the foreseeable future 
additionally  our international revenues have a significant large project component  resulting in a varying revenue stream 
accordingly  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our financial results should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
segments 
we currently operate in three reportable segments autoscope  rtms and citysync 
autoscope is our machine vision product line  and revenue consists of royalties all of which are received from econolite  as well as a portion of international sales 
rtms is our radar product line acquired in the eis asset purchase in december citysync is our anpr product line acquired in the citysync purchase in june all segment revenues are derived from external customers 
as a result of business model changes and modifications in how we manage our business  we may reevaluate our segment definitions in the future 
the following tables set forth selected unaudited financial information for each of our reportable segments in thousands for the year ended december  autoscope rtms citysync total revenue gross profit goodwill impairment amortization of intangible assets intangible assets and goodwill for the year ended december  autoscope rtms citysync total revenue gross profit amortization of intangible assets intangible assets and goodwill 
table of contents for the year ended december  autoscope rtms citysync total revenue gross profit amortization of intangible assets intangible assets and goodwill results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain statements of income data as a percent of total revenue and gross margin on international sales and royalties as a percentage of international sales and royalties  respectively 
year ended december  product sales royalties total revenue gross margin product sales gross margin royalties selling  marketing and product support general and administrative research and development acquisition related expenses income goodwill impairment amortization of intangibles restructuring charges income loss from operations income tax expense benefit net income loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenue decreased to million in from million in  a decrease of 
royalty income increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
product sales decreased to million in from million in  a decrease of 
the decrease in product sales was mainly due to lower sales volume in asia resulting  in part  from increased price and product competition and slower than planned management transitions 
revenue for the autoscope segment increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
revenue for the rtms segment decreased to million in from million in  a decrease of 
the increase in autoscope was due to higher volume mainly driven by two large project sales late in the decrease in rtms was due mainly to lower sales volume in asia and to a lesser extent in north america 
although the citysync segment increased in over  an annualized pro forma comparison shows a decline 
this is due to lower sales volume in and is reflective of a difficult environment for selling security applications to government customers in europe and the united states that we believe was caused by constrained government budgets 
as citysync revenues were below the threshold required to achieve a second earn out payment  in the fourth quarter  we took into income  as a reduction of overall operating expenses   that was estimated and recorded as of the acquisition date 
gross margins for product sales decreased to in from in gross margins for the citysync product line have historically been lower than gross margins for the autoscope and rtms product lines and therefore the mix of the product lines in any given period can result in varying margins 
generally  lower sales volumes of rtms or citysync products will reduce gross margins because of fixed manufacturing costs for these products 
additionally  gross margins were lower as a result of  in restructuring charges related to the rtms business model change 
without this charge  product sale gross margins would have been 
the decrease in gross margins for compared to is reflective of lower sales volumes and unfavorable mix towards lower margin third party equipment 
gross margins on royalty income remained consistent at in each of and we anticipate that gross margins for our product sales will be higher in as compared to  while we expect royalty gross margins will be in selling  marketing and product support expense increased to million or of total revenue in from million or of total revenue in our selling  marketing and product support expense increased mainly due to the addition of citysync operations for a full year but also reflected investments in market expansion activities in europe and asia 
we anticipate that selling  marketing and product support expense will decrease both in terms of dollar amount and as a percentage of revenue in  as compared to  as we realize the impact of restructuring initiatives and the rtms business model change 

table of contents general and administrative expense increased to million or of total revenue in  from million or of total revenue in general and administrative expenses increased in mainly as a result of the addition of the citysync organization and to a lesser extent due to increased foreign currency exchange losses and bad debt reserves 
we anticipate that general and administrative expense will decrease both in terms of dollar amount and as a percentage of revenue in  as compared to  as we realize the impact of restructuring initiatives and the rtms business model change 
research and development expense increased to million or of total revenue in  up from million or of total revenue in the increase was mainly related to the addition of the citysync engineering organization and increased expenditures on our hybrid product development 
we anticipate that research and development expense will remain similar or decrease slightly in terms of dollar amount in as compared to we recognized a goodwill impairment in of million that was triggered by a significant decline in our market capitalization 
if our stock price were to experience a significant and sustained decline  we would expect to recognize a further goodwill impairment charge 
as discussed above  in december  we announced a change to our north american business model for the rtms product line and certain restructuring initiatives 
as a result  we recognized restructuring expense of  related to reserves for inventory and  related mainly to employee severance 
amortization of intangibles expense was million in compared to million in and reflects the amortization of intangible assets acquired in acquisitions 
assuming there are no changes to our intangible assets  we anticipate amortization expense will be approximately million in other income expense  net was an income of  in  primarily consisting of interest income  as opposed to expense of  in mainly due to higher debt balances in  including a portion related to citysync 
income tax benefit of million  or of our pretax loss  was recorded for the year ended december   compared to income tax expense of million  or of pretax income  for the year ended december  we expect the effective rate in to be below year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenue increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
royalty income increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
product sales increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
the increase in product sales was mainly due to the addition of the citysync product line in june and to a lesser extent due to improved sales of rtms in international markets 
revenue for the autoscope segment increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
revenue for the rtms segment increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
the increase resulted mainly as a result of improved sales in international markets 
gross margins for product sales decreased to in from in the decrease resulted mainly from the addition of the citysync product line  which currently earns lower margins than autoscope or rtms  and increased warranty expense for rtms  and to a lesser extent from increased pricing competition for autoscope internationally 
gross margins on royalty income remained consistent at in and selling  marketing and product support expense increased to million or of total revenue in from million or of total revenue in our selling  marketing and product support expense increased in mostly as a result of the addition of the citysync organization 
additionally  we invested in market expansion activities in europe and asia  including adding senior management 
general and administrative expense increased to million or of total revenue in  from million or of total revenue in the general and administrative expenses increased in mainly as a result of the addition of the citysync organization and to a lesser extent due to increased compensation and benefits 
research and development expense increased to million or of total revenue in  up from million or of total revenue in the increase was mainly related to the addition of the citysync engineering organization 
amortization of intangibles expense was million in and reflects the amortization of intangible assets acquired in both the eis asset purchase and the citysync acquisition 
other income expense was an expense of  in  primarily consisting of interest expense  as opposed to income of  in mainly due to higher debt balances in  including a portion related to citysync 

table of contents our income tax effective rate was in compared to in the effective rate was positively impacted by increased tax credits for research and development activities 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term investments  compared to million in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term investments at december  our investment objectives are to preserve principal  maintain liquidity  and achieve the best available return consistent with its primary objectives of safety and liquidity 
net cash used in operating activities was million in  compared to cash provided by operating activities of  and million in and  respectively 
the primary reason for the cash used in was increased inventory balances caused in part by lower than anticipated sales volume 
the primary reason for the change compared to was increased accounts and other receivables outstanding  the majority of which related to citysync activity 
we anticipate that average receivable collection days in will be similar to and that it will not have a material impact on our liquidity 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  compared to cash used in investing activities of million and million in and  respectively 
in  investment balances decreased to partially fund earn out payments paid at the beginning of the year 
our planned additions of property and equipment are discretionary  and we do not expect them to exceed historical levels in we used million of cash in to acquire citysync  including repaying seller loans 
net cash provided by financing activities was  in  compared to cash provided by financing activities of million in and used in financing activities of  in during  we raised million in cash  net of offering expenses  through our secondary offering  which was used to fund the purchase of citysync 
in december  we entered into a term loan agreement for million with associated bank  national association associated bank  which we fully repaid in september we also have a revolving line of credit agreement with associated bank 
the revolving line of credit provides for up to million at an annual interest rate equal to the greater of or libor plus  as reset from time to time by the bank 
advances on the line of credit cannot exceed a borrowing base determined under a formula  which is a percentage of the amounts of eligible receivables 
the line of credit currently has no borrowings outstanding and matures on may  we believe that on an ongoing basis  we will have regular availability to draw a minimum of million on our line of credit based on our qualifying assets 
we believe that cash and cash equivalents on hand at december   along with the availability of funds under our million revolving line of credit and cash provided by operating activities  will satisfy our projected working capital needs  investing activities  and other cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not participate in transactions or have relationships or other arrangements with an unconsolidated entity  including special purpose and similar entities or other off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  which require us to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts  giving due consideration to materiality 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  the following are particularly important to the portrayal of our results of operations and financial position  may require the application of a higher level of judgment by our management  and as a result  are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
for further information see summary of significant accounting policies under note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
goodwill 
we test goodwill at least annually for impairment 
goodwill is also tested for impairment as changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
goodwill impairment testing first requires a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to the carrying value 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds fair value  goodwill is considered impaired 

table of contents we have three discrete reporting units  two of which were assigned goodwill as of december  the fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow model that requires input of certain estimates and assumptions requiring management judgment  including projections of economic conditions and customer demand  revenue and margins  changes in competition  operating costs  and new product introductions 
while we believe the estimates and assumptions used in determining the fair value of our reporting units are reasonable  significant changes in our stock price  market capitalization or estimates of future cash flows  such as those caused by unforeseen events or changes in market conditions  could materially impact the fair value of a reporting unit  which could result in the recognition of a goodwill impairment charge 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review the carrying value of long lived assets or asset groups  such as property and equipment and intangibles subject to amortization  when events or changes in circumstances such as asset utilization  physical change  legal factors  or other matters indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
when this review indicates the carrying value of an asset or asset group exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group  we recognize an asset impairment charge against operations 
the amount of the impairment loss recorded is the amount by which the carrying value of the impaired asset or asset group exceeds its fair value 
our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to identify events or changes in circumstances indicating the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable  estimate future cash flows  estimate asset fair values  and select a discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 
expected cash flows may not be realized  which could cause long lived assets to become impaired in future periods and could have a material adverse effect on future results of operations 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts 
royalty income is recognized based upon a monthly royalty report provided to us by econolite 
this report is prepared by econolite based on its sales of products we developed and is based on sales shipped or delivered to its customers 
revenue is recognized when both product ownership and the risk of loss have transferred to the customer and we have no remaining obligations 
allowances for doubtful accounts are estimated by management based on evaluation of potential losses related to customer receivable balances 
we determine the allowance based on historical write off experience in the industry  regional economic data  and evaluation of specific customer accounts for risk of loss 
we review our allowance for doubtful accounts monthly 
account balances are charged off against the allowance when we believe it is probable the receivable will not be recovered 
we do not have any off balance sheet credit exposure related to our customers 
the establishment of this reserve requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable balances 
although management considers these balances adequate and proper  changes in economic conditions in specific markets in which we operate could have an effect on reserve balances required 
income taxes 
we record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized 
we believe it is more likely than not that forecasted income  including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies  together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities  will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining net realizable value of our deferred tax assets 
in the event that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management s expectations could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results 
inventories 
we maintain a material amount of inventory to support our engineering and manufacturing operations 
this inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market 
on a regular basis  we review our inventory and identify that which is excess  slow moving  and obsolete by considering factors such as inventory levels  expected product life  and forecasted sales demand 
any identified excess  slow moving  and obsolete inventory is written down to its market value through a charge to income from operations 
it is possible that additional inventory write down charges may be required in the future if there is a significant decline in demand for our products 
warranty liabilities 
the estimated cost to service warranty and customer service claims is included in cost of sales 
this estimate is based on historical trends of warranty claims 
we regularly assess and adjust the estimate of accrued warranty claims by updating claims rates for actual trends and projected claim costs 
our warranty liability contains uncertainties because our warranty obligations cover an extended period of time 
a revision of estimated claim rates or the projected cost of materials and freight associated with sending replacement parts to customers could have a material adverse effect on future results of operations 

table of contents new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
asu amends the criteria established in accounting standards codification asc  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements  for separating consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements 
this guidance establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
specifically  the selling price used for each deliverable is based on a vendor specific objective evidence if available  b third party evidence if vendor specific objective evidence is not available  or c estimated selling price if neither vendor specific objective evidence nor third party evidence is available 
in addition  asu eliminates the residual method of allocation and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
also  asu expands required disclosures related to a vendor s multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
the provisions of asu were effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified by us as of the beginning of the current year 
our adoption of the provisions of asu did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
we incorporated the appropriate disclosure provisions of asu upon adoption 
in may  the fasb issued asu  amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs  which also amends asc the purpose of this guidance is to achieve commonality between us gaap and ifrs pertaining to fair value measurement and disclosure requirements 
it changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements particularly for level fair value measurements 
the amendment becomes effective for annual periods beginning after december  we do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued asu  presentation of comprehensive income  which provides an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in both choices  an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income  each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income  and a total amount for comprehensive income 
this eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in shareholders equity 
the amendments do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income 
additionally  in december  the fasb issued asu  deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 
 which indefinitely defers the requirement in asu to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in both the statement in which net income is presented and the statement in which other comprehensive income is presented 
during the deferral period  the existing requirements in us gaap for the presentation of reclassification adjustments must continue to be followed 
the amendments are effective for fiscal years  and for interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning after december  the amendments are to be applied retrospectively  with early adoption permitted 
we do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued asu  testing goodwill for impairment topic 
asu simplifies how an entity is required to test goodwill for impairment by allowing the entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
previous guidance under topic required an entity to test goodwill for impairment  on at least an annual basis  by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
under the provisions of asu  an entity is no longer required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines  based on a qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
asu is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  which  for us  will be the beginning of fiscal year we do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s foreign currency exchange risk approximately of our revenue has historically been derived from shipments to customers outside of the united states  and a large portion of this revenue is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
our international subsidiaries have functional currencies other than our us dollar reporting currency and  occasionally  transact business in currencies other than their functional currencies 
these non functional currency transactions expose us to market risk on assets  liabilities and cash flows recognized on these transactions 
the strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies decreases the value of foreign currency denominated revenue and earnings when translated into us dollars 
conversely  a weakening of the us dollar increases the value of foreign currency denominated revenue and earnings 
a adverse change in foreign currency rates  if we have not properly hedged  could have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position
