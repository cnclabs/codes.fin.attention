item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in thousands  except per share amounts overview the valspar corporation is a global leader in the paint and coatings industry 
with fiscal year net sales of  and more than  employees in over countries  we believe we are the fifth largest paint and coatings supplier in the world 
our strong consumer brands and leading technologies  together with our technical expertise and customer service  differentiate us from our competition and allow us to grow and create value with customers in a wide variety of geographic and end use markets 
our fundamental business objective is to create long term value for our shareholders 
we accomplish this by focusing on our customers and delivering coatings products and solutions based on a deep understanding of their needs  investing in our brands and developing innovative  proprietary technologies  expanding our global presence  enhancing the productivity of our business by maximizing efficiencies in procurement  manufacturing and process adherence  maintaining operational discipline and prudent cost control  generating strong cash flow  and optimizing our allocation of capital to maintain and grow the business  increase dividends  fund internal growth initiatives and strategic acquisitions  and repurchase shares

the following discussion of financial condition and results of operations should be read in the context of this overview 
general economic and industry wide factors the global demand environment remained challenging in in the us  market conditions have been slow to recover after the global recession 
additionally  we saw softening demand in international markets  particularly in europe 
residential construction markets weakened in china and australia 
demand in latin america continued to grow  though at a slower rate than in prior years 
we expect market conditions to be similar in raw material costs in the chemical industry have been volatile over the past several years 
in  the paint industry continued to be affected by year over year increases in raw material costs  though these costs began to moderate in the second half of the year 
we expect raw material costs to remain near current levels in the short term 
despite the challenging global economic conditions  we continued to make solid progress on our long term growth initiatives by continuing to invest in our consumer brands valpsar  cabot  huarun and wattyl 
introducing the love your color guarantee consumer marketing program in the united states and australia 
this branding initiative ensures consumers are satisfied with the color of their valspar paint purchase 
the campaign has resonated with consumers and we announced an extension of the program into entering into an agreement with b q  an operating company of kingfisher plc  the world s third largest diy retail conglomerate  to supply a full selection of premium valspar paint to all of its locations in the united kingdom and ireland 
this initiative substantially expands our presence in the european decorative paint market 
continuing our technology investments  enabling us to deliver product lines that are differentiated from our competition 
to further support our global technology platform  we opened a state of the art research and development r d facility in guangzhou  china and announced the expansion of our primary r d campus in minneapolis 
focusing on productivity improvements  including initiatives to improve processes that generate savings across all product lines and corporate functions 
additionally  we successfully completed a series of initiatives to improve profitability in our australian consumer paints product line 
expanding our presence in china with the construction of a new manufacturing facility in tianjin 
this new plant will increase our capacity in a growing region and provides additional manufacturing and distribution flexibility 
returning cash to shareholders by increasing our annual dividend to per share in fiscal year  our th consecutive year with a dividend increase  and by repurchasing  shares for  which more than offset the exercise of stock options 

table of contents business performance net sales in increased to  from  in excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange and acquisitions  sales increased due to carryover selling price increases across all product lines and new business gains across most of our product lines 
the increase was partially offset by volume declines due to uneven demand in our global markets and our decision to exit a small number of relatively high volume  unprofitable products and customers 
our international sales accounted for approximately of consolidated net sales 
net income  excluding the impairment charges related to goodwill and intangible assets impairment charge in  increased by 
the improvement was driven by the benefit from carryover selling price increases  productivity gains  new business at higher average gross margins  lower restructuring charges in our coatings segment in and acquisition related charges recognized in the improvement was partially offset by volume declines due to market softness  higher raw material costs and the impact of interest expense and a higher tax rate 
during the fiscal year  we generated  in free cash flow net cash provided by operating activities of  less capital expenditures and dividends  an increase of  from the prior year due to improved operating results 
we believe the non gaap measure free cash flow provides useful information to both management and investors by including the amount reinvested in the business for capital expenditures and the return on investment to our shareholders through payment of dividends 
our total debt of  including notes payable  increased by  due to our bond issuance and share repurchases  partially offset by operating cash flow and option exercise proceeds 
in january  we strengthened our liquidity position by issuing  of senior notes due january  with a coupon rate of 
we used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes  including paying down our commercial paper and retiring our  of senior notes that matured on may  our liquidity position is strong  with  in cash and cash equivalents and  in unused committed bank credit facilities providing total committed liquidity of  at year end  compared to  at the end of restructuring we continually evaluate our cost structure in the normal course of our business 
in fiscal year  we exited the gelcoat products market  initiated the consolidation of a manufacturing facility in our paints segment and continued our efforts to improve the profitability of our australian paints product line 
additionally  in fiscal year  we initiated restructuring actions in our coatings segment  primarily in our wood product line  which further rationalized our manufacturing capacity and reduced our overall global headcount 
the total cost was per share after tax  which includes per share after tax charges incurred in fiscal year restructuring activities during fiscal year resulted in pre tax charges of  or per share after tax 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on restructuring 
earnings per share net income loss per common share diluted was for and for the table below presents adjusted net income per common share diluted  which excludes in the respective periods i restructuring charges  ii acqusition related charges and iii the non cash impairment charge on goodwill and intangible assets 
net income loss per common share diluted restructuring charges acquisition related charges impact of dilutive shares non cash impairment charge on goodwill and intangible assets adjusted net income per common share diluted in the non gaap reconciliation of adjusted net income per common share diluted  we used  diluted shares for the period to reflect positive net income on an adjusted basis and the related share dilution 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed our annual goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment reviews 
as a result  we recorded a pre tax impairment loss of  in the fourth quarter of this represents impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in our wood coatings reporting unit  part of our coatings segment  and in our gelcoat reporting unit  part of all other 
the impairment charge resulted from changes in the structure of our reporting units used to conduct our impairment testing  as well as changes in our forecasts for the respective reporting units in light of economic conditions prevailing in the markets for these product lines 
see note and note in notes to consolidated financial statements for further information related to our impairment charge 
adjusted net income per common share diluted is a non gaap financial measure 
we disclose this measure because we believe the measure may assist investors in comparing our results of operations without regard to restructuring charges  the impact of the non cash impairment charge on goodwill and intangible assets and or acquisition related charges 
the acquisition related charges are primarily related to the step up of inventory from our australian acquisition in the paints segment to fair value 
this non gaap measure is provided to enhance investors overall understanding of our current financial performance 
we believe the non gaap measure provides useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses and non cash charges  which may not be indicative of our core operating results 
in addition  because we have historically reported certain non gaap results to investors  we believe the inclusion of this non gaap measure provides consistency in our presentation of financial information 
see note and note in notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on goodwill and intangible assets and restructuring  respectively

table of contents financial condition our financial condition  cash flow and liquidity remained strong in cash flow from operations was  in  compared to  in and  in the improvement in cash flow in was primarily driven by higher earnings  along with efficient working capital management 
a key metric we use to measure the effectiveness of our working capital management is net working capital as a percentage of annual net sales october  of net sales october  of net sales accounts and notes receivable  net inventories trade accounts payable net working capital our net working capital as a percentage of net sales decreased to from 
this improvement was driven by our effective working capital management  in particular  accounts payable where we have implemented several initiatives to increase our days payable outstanding 
during the period  we used the strong cash flow from operations and  in net proceeds from bank borrowings to fund  in share repurchases and  in capital expenditures 
we used cash on hand and  in proceeds from the sale of treasury stock to fund  in dividend payments 
in the first quarter of  we issued  of unsecured senior notes that mature on january  with a coupon rate of 
the proceeds  net of issuance costs  were  the public offering was made pursuant to a registration statement filed with the us securities and exchange commission 
we used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes  including paying down our commercial paper borrowings and retiring our  of senior notes that matured on may  see notes and in notes to consolidated financial statements for more information related to our restricted cash primarily associated with cash collateralization of our liability insurance programs 
the ratio of total debt to capital was at october   compared to at october  average debt outstanding during was  at a weighted average interest rate of versus  at last year 
interest expense for was  compared to  in under various agreements  we are obligated to make future cash payments in fixed amounts 
these include payments under our multi currency credit facilities  senior notes  industrial development bonds  employee benefit plans  non cancelable operating leases with initial or remaining terms in excess of one year  capital expenditures  commodity purchase commitments and telecommunication commitments 
some of our interest charges are variable and are assumed at current rates 
the following table summarizes our fixed cash obligations as of october  for the fiscal years ending in october and thereafter total notes interest to banks senior notes interest industrial development bonds interest medical retiree serp pension operating leases capital expenditures commodity purchase commitments telecommunication commitments total contractual cash obligations 
table of contents we expect to make cash outlays in the future related to uncertain tax positions 
however  due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows  we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement  if any  with the respective taxing authorities 
accordingly  gross unrecognized tax benefits of  as of october   have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
for further information related to unrecognized tax benefits see note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
we maintain an unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks expiring in december and a us dollar equivalent unsecured committed revolving bilateral credit facility expiring september as of october  and october  our bank credit facilities consisted of the following october  total outstanding facility size december bank syndicate facility september bilateral facility total unsecured committed revolving credit uncommitted bank lines of credit total bank credit facilities october  total outstanding facility size december bank syndicate facility june bilateral facility september bilateral facility total unsecured committed revolving credit uncommitted bank lines of credit total bank credit facilities our bank syndicate facility includes  and  of commercial paper as of october  and october   respectively 
we have a  commercial paper program backstopped by our  credit facility 
our credit facilities have covenants that require us to maintain certain financial ratios 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of october  our debt covenants do not limit  nor are they reasonably likely to limit  our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing 
to ensure availability of funds  we maintain uncommitted bank lines of credit sufficient to cover outstanding short term borrowings 
these arrangements are reviewed periodically for renewal and modification 
at october   we had unused lines of committed and uncommitted credit available from banks of  we believe cash flow from operations  existing lines of credit  access to credit facilities and access to debt and capital markets will be sufficient to meet our current liquidity needs 
in the current market conditions  we have demonstrated continued access to capital markets 
we have committed liquidity and cash reserves in excess of our anticipated funding requirements 
our cash and cash equivalent balances consist of high quality  short term money market instruments and cash held by our international subsidiaries that are used to fund those subsidiaries day to day operating needs 
those balances have also been used to finance acquisitions 
our investment policy on excess cash is to preserve principal 
we use derivative instruments with a number of counterparties principally to manage well defined interest rate and foreign currency exchange risks 
we evaluate the financial stability of each counterparty and spread the risk among several financial institutions to limit our exposure 
we will continue to monitor counterparty risk on an ongoing basis 
we do not have any credit risk related contingent features in our derivative contracts as of october  we paid common stock dividends of  or per share in  an increase of per share over common stock dividends of  or per share 
we have continuing authorization to purchase shares of our common stock at management s discretion for general corporate purposes 
we repurchased  shares totaling  in compared to  shares totaling  in and  shares totaling  in at october  we had  shares remaining under our current authorization 
in december  the board increased that share repurchase authorization to  shares 
we are involved in various claims relating to environmental and waste disposal matters at a number of current and former plant sites 
we engage or participate in remedial and other environmental compliance activities at certain of these sites 
at other sites  we have been named as a potentially responsible party prp under federal and state environmental laws for the remediation of hazardous waste 
we analyze each individual site  considering the number of parties involved  the level of potential liability or contribution by us relative to the other parties  the nature and magnitude of the wastes involved  the method and extent of remediation  the potential insurance coverage  the estimated legal and consulting expense with respect to each site  and the time period over which any costs would likely be incurred 
based on the above analysis  we estimate the remediation or other clean up costs and related claims for each site 
the estimates are based in part on discussions with other prps  governmental agencies and engineering firms 
we accrue appropriate reserves for potential environmental liabilities  which are continually reviewed and adjusted as additional information becomes available 
our reserves are not discounted 
while uncertainties exist with respect to the amounts and timing of our ultimate environmental liabilities  we believe there is not a reasonable possibility that such liabilities  individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents we are involved in a variety of legal claims and proceedings relating to personal injury  product liability  warranties  customer contracts  employment  trade practices  environmental and other legal matters that arise in the normal course of business 
these claims and proceedings include cases where we are one of a number of defendants in proceedings alleging that the plaintiffs suffered injuries or contracted diseases from exposure to chemicals or other ingredients used in the production of some of our products or waste disposal 
we are also subject to claims related to the performance of our products 
we believe these claims and proceedings are not out of the ordinary course for a business of the type and size in which we are engaged 
while we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these claims and proceedings  we believe there is not a reasonable possibility that the costs and liabilities of such matters  individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
we regularly review our estimates and assumptions  which are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following areas are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and that the judgments and estimates are reasonable revenue recognition other than extended furniture protection plans  revenue from sales is recognized at the time of product delivery  passage of title  a sales agreement is in place  pricing is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
discounts provided to customers at the point of sale are recognized as a reduction in revenue as the products are sold 
we sell extended furniture protection plans for which revenue is deferred and recognized over the life of the contract 
an actuarial study utilizing historical claims data is used to forecast claim payments over the contract period  and revenue is recognized based on the forecasted claims payments 
actual claims costs are reflected in earnings in the period incurred 
anticipated losses on programs in progress are charged to earnings when identified 
supplier and customer rebates in accordance with underlying agreements  as they are earned  we estimate and record supplier and customer rebates as a reduction of cost of goods sold or a reduction to revenue  respectively 
the customer rebate estimate is developed based on historical experience plus current activity for the customer s purchases 
customer rebates that increase based on different levels of sales volume are recognized immediately when the current activity plus expected volume triggers a higher earned rebate 
the supplier rebate estimate is developed based on contractual terms of our current purchasing activity 
supplier rebates that increase based on different levels of purchases are recognized when there is certainty that the current level of purchases will trigger a higher rebate earned 
valuation of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of identifiable net assets of businesses acquired 
other intangible assets consist of customer lists and relationships  purchased technology and patents and trademarks 
goodwill for our reporting units is reviewed for impairment at least annually using a two step process 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
we use the following four material assumptions in our fair value analysis a discount rates  b long term sales growth rates  c forecasted operating margins  and d market multiples 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  the goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired and we would then complete step in order to measure the impairment loss 
in step  we would calculate the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets including unrecognized intangible assets of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill  we would recognize an impairment loss  in the period identified  equal to the difference 
we review indefinite lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment by calculating the fair value of the assets and comparing those fair values to the carrying value 
in assessing fair value  we generally utilize a relief from royalty method 
if the carrying value of the indefinite lived intangible assets exceeds the fair value of the asset  the carrying value is written down to fair value in the period identified 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed our annual goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment reviews with no impairments to the carrying values identified 
for purposes of the impairment analysis  we reconsidered the appropriate reporting units as a result of the impairment charge recognized in the fourth quarter of there was no change to our reporting units  other than our exit from the gelcoat products market in the current year 

table of contents in the fourth quarter of  we completed our annual goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment reviews 
during the goodwill review  the carrying value for the wood coatings and gelcoat reporting units exceeded the fair value  requiring a step valuation using an income approach level measurement in the fair value hierarchy 
as a result  we recorded a pre tax impairment loss of  in the fourth quarter of this represents impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in our wood coatings reporting unit  part of our coatings segment  and in our gelcoat reporting unit  part of all other 
no impairment to the carrying values of the other reporting units was identified 
considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows 
assumptions used in our impairment evaluations  such as long term sales growth rates  forecasted operating margins  market multiples and our discount rate  are based on the best available market information and are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans 
additionally  in assessing goodwill impairment we considered the implied control premium and concluded it was reasonable based on other recent market transactions 
changes in these estimates or a continued decline in general economic conditions could change our conclusion regarding an impairment of goodwill and potentially result in a non cash impairment loss in a future period 
the discount rate  long term sales growth rate  forecasted operating margins and market multiple assumptions are the four material assumptions utilized in our calculations of the present value cash flows and the business enterprise fair value used to estimate the fair value of the reporting units when performing the annual goodwill impairment test and in testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
we utilize a cash flow approach level valuation technique in estimating the fair value of the reporting units for the income approach  where the discount rate reflects a weighted average cost of capital rate 
the cash flow model used to derive fair value is most sensitive to the discount rate  long term sales growth rate and forecasted operating margin assumptions used 
for the market approach  average revenue and earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization multiples derived from our peer group are weighted and adjusted for size  risk and growth of the individual reporting unit to determine the reporting unit s business enterprise fair value 
the resulting values from the two approaches are weighted to derive the final fair value of the reporting units that will be compared with the reporting units carrying value when assessing impairment in step for reporting units that do not fail step  we perform a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate  long term sales growth rate and forecasted operating margin assumptions 
the discount rate could increase by more than of the discount rate utilized  the long term sales growth rate assumption could decline to a zero growth environment  or costs could remain at the current spending level with no cost savings realized in future periods and our reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets would continue to have fair value in excess of carrying value 
in fiscal  we have no reporting units that are at risk of failing step of our goodwill or indefinite lived intangible asset impairment tests 
there have been no significant events since the timing of our impairment tests that would have triggered additional impairment testing 
the assumptions used in our impairment testing could be adversely affected by certain risks discussed in risk factors in item a of this report 
for additional information about goodwill and intangible assets  see note and in notes to consolidated financial statements 
pension and post retirement medical obligations we sponsor several defined benefit plans for certain hourly and salaried employees 
we sponsor post retirement medical benefits for certain us employees 
the amounts recognized in our financial statements are determined on an actuarial basis 
to accomplish this  extensive use is made of assumptions about inflation  investment returns  mortality  turnover  medical trend rates and discount rates 
a change in these assumptions could cause actual results to differ from those reported 
a reduction of basis points in the long term rate of return and a reduction of basis points in the discount rate would have increased our pension expense  in a increase in the medical trend rates would not have a material effect on post retirement medical expense or the post retirement benefit obligation 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements  for further details regarding accounting for pensions and post retirement medical benefits 
income taxes at each period end  it is necessary for us to make certain estimates and assumptions to compute the provision for income taxes including  but not limited to the expected operating income or loss for the year  projections of the proportion of income or loss earned and taxed in the foreign jurisdictions and the extent to which this income or loss may also be taxed in the united states  permanent and temporary differences  the likelihood of deferred tax assets being recovered and the outcome of uncertain tax positions 
our income tax returns  like those of most companies  are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities 
these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions  including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
at any one time  multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities 
we record an accrual for more likely than not exposures after evaluating the positions associated with our various income tax filings 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an accrual is audited and fully resolved or clarified 
we adjust our tax contingencies accrual and income tax provision in the period in which matters are effectively settled with tax authorities at amounts different from our established accrual  the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available 
the internal revenue service irs concluded its examination of our us federal tax returns for the fiscal years ended and in october there were no material adjustments to our income tax expense or balance of unrecognized tax benefits as a result of the irs examination 
we are currently under audit in several state and foreign jurisdictions 
we also expect various statutes of limitation to expire during the next months 
due to the uncertain response of taxing authorities  a range of outcomes cannot be reasonably estimated at this time

we may identify forward looking statements with words and phrases such as expects  projects  estimates  anticipates  believes  could  may  will  plans to  intend  should and similar expressions 
these risks  uncertainties and other factors include  but are not limited to  deterioration in general economic conditions  both domestic and international  that may adversely affect our business  fluctuations in availability and prices of raw materials  including raw material shortages and other supply chain disruptions  and the inability to pass along or delays in passing along raw material cost increases to our customers  dependence of internal sales and earnings growth on business cycles affecting our customers and growth in the domestic and international coatings industry  market share loss to  and pricing or margin pressure from  larger competitors with greater financial resources  significant indebtedness that restricts the use of cash flow from operations for acquisitions and other investments  dependence on acquisitions for growth  and risks related to future acquisitions  including adverse changes in the results of acquired businesses  the assumption of unforeseen liabilities and disruptions resulting from the integration of acquisitions  risks and uncertainties associated with operations and achievement of profitable growth in developing markets  including asia and central and south america  loss of business with key customers  damage to our reputation and business resulting from product claims or recalls  litigation  customer perception and other matters  our ability to respond to technology changes and to protect our technology  changes in governmental regulation  including more stringent environmental  health and safety regulations  our reliance on the efforts of vendors  government agencies  utilities and other third parties to achieve adequate compliance and avoid disruption of our business  unusual weather conditions adversely affecting sales  changes in accounting policies and standards and taxation requirements such as new tax laws or revised tax law interpretations  the nature  cost and outcome of pending and future litigation and other legal proceedings  and civil unrest and the outbreak of war and other significant national and international events 
we undertake no obligation to subsequently revise any forward looking statement to reflect new information  events or circumstances after the date of such statement  except as required by law 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our foreign sales and results of operations are subject to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
as most of our underlying costs are denominated in the same currency as our sales  the effect has not been material 
we have not hedged our exposure to translation gains and losses  however  we have reduced our exposure by borrowing funds in local currencies 
a adverse change in foreign currency rates is not expected to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
we are also subject to interest rate risk 
at october   approximately of our total debt consisted of floating rate debt 
from time to time  we may enter into interest rate derivatives to hedge a portion of either our variable or fixed rate debt 
assuming the current level of borrowings  a increase in interest rates from those in effect at the end of the fourth quarter would not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position
