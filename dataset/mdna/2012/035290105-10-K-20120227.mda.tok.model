an additional million will be paid to the company if certain financial targets are achieved on or before december  the contingent payment of million was not recorded  nor was it included in the calculation of the loss on the sale of aerospace as it is the company s policy to recognize contingent receivables in connection with a divestiture on the date the contingent receivable is realized 
acquisition of business in december of  the company acquired all the outstanding shares of clark security products  inc and the assets and operations of general lock  llc collectively clark 
clark  based in san diego  california  is a distributor of security products and locksmith supplies to commercial  industrial and government entities throughout the united states  with major distribution centers in san diego  california  dallas  texas  sacramento  california  denver  colorado  lexington  kentucky  silver spring  maryland  phoenix  arizona  and kent  washington

as a result of the acquisition of clark  sales and operating income were favorably affected in by million and million  respectively

the clark acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and its respective results of operations are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
had the acquisition occurred at the beginning of the year of the acquisition  the company s operating results would not have been significantly different 
intangible amortization expense related to all of the company s intangible assets of million at december  is expected to be approximately million per year for the next five years 
financial liquidity and capital resources overview as a distributor  the company s use of capital is largely for working capital to support its revenue base 
capital commitments for property  plant and equipment are limited to information technology assets  warehouse equipment  office furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements  since the company operates almost entirely from leased facilities 
therefore  in any given reporting period  the amount of cash consumed or generated by operations other than from net earnings will primarily be due to changes in working capital as a result of the rate of increases or decreases to sales 
in periods when sales are increasing  the expanded working capital needs will be funded first by cash from operations  secondly from additional borrowings and lastly from additional equity offerings 
in periods when sales are decreasing  the company will have improved cash flows due to reduced working capital requirements 
during such periods  the company will use the expanded cash flow to reduce the amount of leverage in its capital structure until such time as the outlook for improved economic conditions and growth are clear 
also  the company will  from time to time  issue or retire borrowings or equity in an effort to maintain a cost effective capital structure consistent with its anticipated capital requirements

in  million was spent on capital expenditures  million shares of common stock were repurchased in the open market for million and the company retired a portion of its senior notes due notes due and notes due for a total of million 
also in  the company declared a special dividend for per share that was payable on october  to shareholders of record on october  with a year end cash balance of million and available committed credit facilities  the company will continue to evaluate the optimal use of these funds 
the company may from time to time repurchase additional amounts of the company s outstanding shares or outstanding debt obligations 
the company maintains the flexibility to utilize future cash flows to invest in the growth of the business  and it believes that the current leverage on the balance sheet positions the company to effectively capitalize on the improved economic environment as well as additional acquisition opportunities when they become available 
the company will continue to balance its focus on sales and earnings growth with continuing efforts in cost control and working capital management 
maintaining a strong and flexible financial position continues to be vital to funding investment in strategic long term growth initiatives

results of operations executive overview the company competes with distributors and manufacturers who sell products directly or through existing distribution channels to end users or other resellers 
the company s relationship with the manufacturers for which it distributes products could be affected by decisions made by these manufacturers as the result of changes in management or ownership as well as other factors 
although the company has strong relationships with its suppliers  the loss of a major supplier could have a temporary adverse effect on the company s business  but would not have a lasting impact since comparable products are available from alternate sources 
the company s operating results can be affected by changes in prices of commodities  primarily copper  which are components in some of the products sold 
generally  as the costs of inventory purchases increase due to higher commodity prices  the company s mark up percentage to customers remains relatively constant  resulting in higher sales revenue and gross profit 
in addition  existing inventory purchased at previously lower prices and sold as prices increase may result in a higher gross profit margin 
conversely  a decrease in commodity prices in a short period of time would have the opposite effect  negatively affecting financial results 
the degree to which spot market copper prices change affects product prices and the amount of gross profit earned will be affected by end market demand and overall economic conditions 
importantly  however  there is no exact measure of the effect of changes in copper prices  as there are thousands of transactions in any given quarter  each of which has various factors involved in the individual pricing decisions 
therefore  all references to the effect of copper prices are estimates 
the company reported sales of  million in  an increase of million  or  over sales of  million in favorable effects of foreign exchange rates increased sales by million while an increase in copper prices and the acquisition of clark increased sales in by million and million  respectively  as compared to excluding these favorable effects  the company s net sales increased million  or approximately 
the company s execution of its strategic initiatives are helping to fuel its sales growth in each of its end markets around the world 
these efforts have once again delivered well balanced sales performance across the company s geographic reporting segments with north america  europe and emerging markets all delivering excellent year on year sales increases ranging between and 
sales growth by end market was also robust  with electrical wire cable and oem supply end markets delivering a and improvement year on year  respectively 
in addition  the enterprise cabling and security end market grew by  with approximately one fourth of that growth coming from the clark acquisition 
operating expenses in of  million were of sales compared to in excluding the impact of the clark acquisition of million and exchange rates of million  year on year operating expenses increased by only million  or  on a organic increase in sales  demonstrating the leverage in the company s operating structure 
expense increases were primarily due to higher volume 
however  the company reached favorable settlement of several customer bankruptcy and disputes which resulted in lower than normal operating expenses in the momentum that has been building throughout this recovery is reflected in the company s strong operating profit performance 
specifically  operating margin in improved to from in this performance resulted in an incremental operating profit leverage of on the increased year on year sales 
the strong operating margin improvement was driven by better operating leverage on higher sales 
continued strong sales should position the company very well to further leverage its global supply chain platform in while growing global markets will positively impact the business  market pressures on sovereign debt  government fiscal policies and unclear us tax policies create uncertainty for future levels of corporate spending 
nevertheless  the company believes that its strategic growth initiatives position it well to achieve continued sales growth and operating leverage 
overall  the company believes that these strategic growth initiatives have driven improved market share 
we expect future growth to be fueled by adding new products and technologies to the company s portfolio where appropriate  developing an end market presence in either electrical wire cable or oem supply in countries where the company s current presence is large but limited primarily to the enterprise cabling and security solutions end market  and selectively expanding the company s geographic presence 
versus consolidated results years ended in millions december  december  percent change net sales gross profit operating expenses operating income net sales the company s net sales during increased million  or  from the prior year 
favorable effects of foreign exchange rates increased sales by million while an increase in copper prices and the fourth quarter of acquisition of clark increased sales in by million and million  respectively  as compared to excluding the favorable effects of foreign exchange rates  copper prices and the clark acquisition  the company s net sales increased million  or approximately  in as compared to all geographic segments as well as all worldwide end markets enterprise cabling and security  electrical wire and cable and oem supply reported year on year organic sales growth 
gross margin gross margin was in and the effects of higher copper prices did not impact gross margin percentages significantly  however  the effects of copper prices did increase gross profit dollars by million in as compared to the prior year 
gross margin continues to be negatively impacted by cost pressures in the company s european oem supply business due to significant unilateral cost increases from european based fastener manufacturers 
the company continues to make progress recovering cost increases through price increases to its customers 
however  the company has not fully recovered to the level of its second quarter gross margin in this end market 
the company s level of success in negotiating customer pricing in the context of long term contractual agreements  while selectively resourcing some of these components to lower cost manufacturers  will determine the extent to which the company can offset these gross margin pressures over time 
operating expenses operating expenses increased from million in to  million in operating expenses in include an incremental million related to the clark acquisition  million due to changes in foreign exchange rates and million for a restructuring charge to rationalize the european cost structure 
excluding these items  operating expenses increased million  or  on a organic increase in sales 
the current period increase in operating expenses reflects higher variable costs associated with the increase in organic sales  including higher variable incentive costs 
operating income operating income increased by million  or  to million in as compared to million in higher copper prices  the clark acquisition and the effects of foreign exchange rate changes increased operating income by million  million and million  respectively 
the operating margin of in increased from in excluding the european restructuring charge  operating margin was 
the strong operating margin improvement was primarily due to lower operating expenses as a percent of sales 
interest expense consolidated interest expense was million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease in interest expense was driven by a lower average cost of debt than in the company s average cost of debt was in  down from in  primarily due to the retirement of higher cost debt in the first quarter of approximately of the company s outstanding debt had fixed interest rates either by the terms of the debt or through hedging contracts in the company s debt to total capitalization at december  and december  was and  respectively 
early retirement of debt the year ended december  included a pre tax gain of million related to the early retirement of the remaining notes due this gain was fully offset by a pre tax loss related to the refinancing of certain credit facilities

the combined effect of declines in both the equity and bond markets resulted in a million decline in the cash surrender value of company owned life insurance policies associated with the company sponsored deferred compensation program in this compares to a million increase in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies in the prior year 
income taxes the tax provision for was million compared to million the company s effective tax rate for was as compared to in the prior year 
the lower rate is primarily the result of recording net tax benefits of million which include the changes in tax valuation allowances of million  partially offset by additional prior year taxes of million 
approximately million  net  of the tax benefits was a correction of an error from prior periods to reverse valuation allowances for deferred tax assets in certain jurisdictions where sufficient evidence existed to support the realization of these deferred tax assets at a more likely than not level 
the company has determined the error is not material to previously issued financial statements  and the correction of the error is not material to the results of operations for the fiscal year ended december  the tax provision includes a reversal of million for prior years foreign taxes 
excluding the million of net tax benefits  the full year rate would have been in compared to in after excluding the loss on the repurchase of debt  the foreign exchange gain in venezuela and the reversal of prior years foreign taxes 
net income from continuing operations for the year ended december   the company reported net income from continuing operations of million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  in the year ago period  representing an increase of 
the year on year comparisons were impacted by the following in  the tax valuation allowance adjustment of million per diluted share and the european restructuring charge of million million net of tax  or per diluted share 
these items increased net income from continuing operations by a combined million per diluted share 
in  the pre tax loss on the early retirement of debt of million million net of tax  or per diluted share  the foreign exchange gain in venezuela of million million net of tax  or per diluted share and the reversal of prior years foreign taxes of million per diluted share 
these items decreased net income from continuing operations by a combined million per diluted share 
after adjusting for these items  net income increased to million in from million in while diluted earnings per share increased to in from in north america results years ended in millions december  december  percent change net sales gross profit operating expenses operating income net sales when compared to  north america net sales in increased to  million from  million 
excluding favorable effects of foreign exchange rate changes  the impact of the acquisition of clark and copper prices of million  million and million  respectively  north america net sales were  million in  which represents an organic increase of million  or approximately  as compared to this growth is driven by higher sales in all end markets

favorable foreign exchange rates increased net sales by million in excluding copper price effects and the favorable effects of foreign exchange rate changes  europe net sales were  million in  which represents an organic increase of million  or approximately  over this growth is driven by higher sales in the oem supply end market due to the increased manufacturing production in most vertical markets  together with solid growth in the enterprise cabling and security end market 
gross margin gross margin in was compared to in the increase in gross margin is primarily due to stronger sales of the higher margin oem supply products as compared to the sales growth in the other end markets 
however  gross margin continues to be negatively impacted by cost pressures in the company s european oem supply business due to significant unilateral cost increases from european based fastener manufacturers 
the company continues to make progress recovering cost increases through price increases to its customers 
however  the company has not fully recovered to the level of its second quarter gross margin in this end market

critical accounting policies and estimates the company believes that the following are critical areas of accounting that either require significant judgment by management or may be affected by changes in general market conditions outside the control of management 
as a result  changes in estimates and general market conditions could cause actual results to differ materially from future expected results 
historically  the company s estimates in these critical areas have not differed materially from actual results 
allowance for doubtful accounts at december  and december   the company reported net accounts receivable of  million and  million  respectively 
the company carries its accounts receivable at their face amounts less an allowance for doubtful accounts which was million and million at the end of and  respectively 
on a regular basis  the company evaluates its accounts receivable and establishes the allowance for doubtful accounts based on a combination of specific customer circumstances  as well as credit conditions and history of write offs and collections 
each quarter the company segregates the doubtful receivable balances into the following major categories and determines the bad debt reserve required as outlined below customers that are no longer paying their balances are reserved based on the historical write off percentages  risk accounts are individually reviewed and the reserve is based on the probability of potential default 
the company continually monitors payment patterns of customers  investigates past due accounts to assess the likelihood of collection and monitors industry and economic trends to estimate required allowances  and the outstanding balance for customers who have declared bankruptcy is reserved at the outstanding balance less the estimated net realizable value 
if circumstances related to the above factors change  the company s estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to the company could be reduced or increased by a material amount 
inventory obsolescence at december  and december   the company reported inventory of  million and million  respectively net of inventory reserves of million and million  respectively 
each quarter the company reviews for excess inventories and makes an assessment of the net realizable value 
there are many factors that management considers in determining whether or not or the amount by which a reserve should be established 
these factors include the following return or rotation privileges with vendors  price protection from vendors  expected future usage  whether or not a customer is obligated by contract to purchase the inventory  current market pricing  historical consumption experience  and risk of obsolescence 
if circumstances related to the above factors change  there could be a material impact on the net realizable value of the inventories 
pension expense accounting rules related to pensions and the policies used by the company generally reduce the recognition of actuarial gains and losses in the net benefit cost  as any significant actuarial gains losses are amortized over the remaining service lives of the plan participants 
these actuarial gains and losses are mainly attributable to the return on plan assets that differ from that assumed and differences in the obligation due to changes in the discount rate  plan demographic changes and other assumptions 
a significant element in determining the company s net periodic benefit cost in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles us gaap is the expected return on plan assets 
for  the company had assumed that the weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets would be 
this expected return on plan assets is included in the net periodic benefit cost for the fiscal year ended as a result of the combined effect of valuation changes in both the equity and bond markets  the plan assets produced an actual gain of approximately in as compared to a gain of in as a result  the fair value of plan assets is million at the end of fiscal  compared to million at the end of fiscal when the difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is significant  the difference is amortized into expense over the service lives of the plan participants 
these amounts are reflected on the balance sheet through charges to other comprehensive income loss  a component of stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheet 
the measurement date for all plans of the company is december st 
accordingly  at the end of each fiscal year  the company determines the discount rate to be used to discount the plan liabilities to their present value 
the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
in estimating this rate at the end of and  the company reviewed rates of return on relevant market indices ie  the citigroup pension liability index 
these rates are adjusted to match the duration of the liabilities associated with the pension plans 
at december  and december   the company determined the consolidated weighted average rate of all plans to be and  respectively  and used this rate to measure the projected benefit obligation at the end of each respective fiscal year end 
as a result of the change in the discount rate as well as changes in foreign exchange rates  the projected benefit obligation increased to million at the end of fiscal from million at the end of fiscal as a result of the change in asset values and the projected benefit obligation  the company s consolidated net pension liability was million at the end of fiscal compared to million at the end of based on the consolidated weighted average discount rate at the beginning of and and  respectively  the company recognized a consolidated pre tax net periodic cost of million in  down from million in the company estimates its net periodic cost to increase by over primarily due to higher interest costs as a result of lower discount rates 
due to its long duration  the pension liability is very sensitive to changes in the discount rate 
as a sensitivity measure  the effect of a basis point decline in the assumed discount rate would result in an increase in the pension expense of approximately million and an increase in the projected benefit obligations at december  of million 
a basis point decline in the assumed rate of return on assets would result in an increase in the expense of approximately million 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets on an annual basis  the company tests for goodwill impairment using a two step process  unless there is a triggering event  in which case a test would be performed at the time that such triggering event occurs 
the first step is to identify a potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount 
for all periods presented  the company s reporting units are consistent with its operating segments of north america  europe  latin america and asia pacific 
the estimates of fair value of a reporting unit are determined using the income approach based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
a discounted cash flow analysis requires the company to make various judgmental assumptions  including assumptions about future cash flows  growth rates and discount rates 
the assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates are based on management s forecast of each reporting unit 
discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting units from the perspective of market participants 
the company also reviews market multiple information to corroborate the fair value conclusions recorded through the aforementioned income approach 
if step one indicates a carrying value above the estimated fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
the company performed its annual impairment analysis during the third quarter of and concluded that no impairment existed 
the company expects the carrying amount of remaining goodwill to be fully recoverable 
due to business and economic conditions that existed in  the company concluded that there were impairment indicators for the north america  europe and asia pacific reporting units that required an interim impairment analysis be performed under generally accepted accounting principles us gaap during the second fiscal quarter of that year 
in the first step of the impairment analysis  the company performed valuation analyses utilizing the income approach to determine the fair value of its reporting units 
the company also considered the market approach as described in us gaap 
under the income approach  the company determined the fair value based on estimated future cash flows discounted by an estimated weighted average cost of capital  which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of the reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn 
the inputs used for the income approach were significant unobservable inputs  or level inputs  in the fair value hierarchy described in recently issued accounting guidance on fair value measurements 
estimated future cash flows were based on the company s internal projection models  industry projections and other assumptions deemed reasonable by management as those that would be made by a market participant 
based on the results of the company s assessment in step one  it was determined that the carrying value of the europe reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value while north america and asia pacific s fair value exceeded the carrying value 
therefore  the company performed a second step of the impairment test to estimate the implied fair value of goodwill in europe 
in the second step of the impairment analysis  the company determined the implied fair value of goodwill for the europe reporting unit by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of europe s assets and liabilities  as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the price paid to acquire it was the fair value 
the analysis indicated that there would be an implied value attributable to goodwill of million in the europe reporting unit and accordingly  in the second quarter of  the company recorded a non cash impairment charge related to the write off of the remaining goodwill of million associated with its europe reporting unit 
deferred tax assets at december  and december   the company s allowance for deferred tax assets were million and million  respectively 
the company maintains valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
changes in valuation allowances are included in the company s tax provision in the period of change 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted  management evaluates factors such as prior earnings history  expected future earnings  carryback and carryforward periods and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 
assessments are made at each balance sheet date to determine how much of each deferred tax asset is realizable 
these estimates are subject to change in the future  particularly if earnings of a particular subsidiary are significantly higher or lower than expected  or if management takes operational or tax planning actions that could impact the future taxable earnings of a subsidiary 
uncertain tax positions in the normal course of business  the company is audited by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  and is periodically challenged regarding the amount of taxes due 
these challenges relate to the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
management believes the company s tax positions comply with applicable tax law and the company intends to defend its positions 
the company recognizes the benefit of tax positions when a benefit is more likely than not ie  greater than likely to be sustained on its technical merits 
recognized tax benefits are measured at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained  based on cumulative probability  in final settlement of the position 
the company s effective tax rate in a given period could be impacted if  upon final resolution with taxing authorities  the company prevailed in positions for which reserves have been established  or was required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves 
as of december   the aggregate amount of global uncertain tax position liabilities and related interest and penalties recorded was approximately million 
the uncertain tax positions cover a range of issues  in particular  certain financing related activities related to the company  intercompany charges and withholding taxes  and involve numerous different taxing jurisdictions

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of fluctuations in foreign currencies and interest rate changes  as well as changes in the market value of its financial instruments 
the company periodically enters into derivatives in order to minimize these risks  but not for trading purposes 
the company s strategy is to negotiate terms for its derivatives and other financial instruments to be perfectly effective  such that the change in the value of the derivative perfectly offsets the impact of the underlying hedged item eg  various foreign currency denominated accounts 
the company s counterparties to its derivative contracts have investment grade credit ratings 
the company expects the creditworthiness of its counterparties to remain intact through the term of the transactions 
the company regularly monitors the creditworthiness of its counterparties to ensure no issues exist which could affect the value of the derivatives 
any resulting gains or losses from hedge ineffectiveness are reflected directly in other  net in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
during periods of volatility in foreign exchange rates  the company can be subject to significant foreign exchange gains and losses since there is a time lag between when the company incurs the foreign exchange exposure and when the company has the information to properly hedge the exposure 
foreign exchange risk the company s foreign currency denominated sales were in  in and in the company s exposure to currency rate fluctuations primarily relate to europe euro and british pound and canada canadian dollar 
the company also has exposure to currency rate fluctuations related to more volatile markets such as argentina peso  australia dollar  brazil real  chile peso  colombia peso  mexico peso and venezuela bolivar 
the company s investments in several subsidiaries are recorded in currencies other than the us dollar 
as these foreign currency denominated investments are translated at the end of each period during consolidation using period end exchange rates  fluctuations of exchange rates between the foreign currency and the us dollar increase or decrease the value of those investments 
these fluctuations and the results of operations for foreign subsidiaries  where the functional currency is not the us dollar  are translated into us dollars using the average exchange rates during the year  while the assets and liabilities are translated using period end exchange rates 
the assets and liabilities related translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity  foreign currency translation  which is a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
in addition  as the company s subsidiaries maintain investments denominated in currencies other than local currencies  exchange rate fluctuations will occur 
borrowings are raised in certain foreign currencies to minimize the exchange rate translation adjustment risk 
several of the company s subsidiaries conduct business in a currency other than the legal entity s functional currency 
transactions may produce receivables or payables that are fixed in terms of the amount of foreign currency that will be received or paid 
a change in exchange rates between the functional currency and the currency in which a transaction is denominated increases or decreases the expected amount of functional currency cash flows upon settlement of the transaction 
that increase or decrease in expected functional currency cash flows is a foreign exchange transaction gain or loss that is included in other  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
the company purchases foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currency denominated accounts on its reported income 
the foreign currency forward contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes 
at december  and december   the notional amount of the foreign currency forward contracts outstanding was approximately million and million  respectively 
the company prepared sensitivity analyses of its foreign currency forward contracts assuming a adverse change in the value of foreign currency contracts outstanding 
the hypothetical adverse changes would have resulted in the company recording a million and million loss in fiscal and  respectively 
however  as these forward contracts are intended to be perfectly effective economic hedges  the company would record offsetting gains as a result of the remeasurement of the underlying foreign currency denominated monetary accounts being hedged 
venezuela foreign exchange the company s functional currency for financial reporting purposes in venezuela is the us dollar usd 
inventory is sourced from vendors in the united states including the parent company of the venezuelan subsidiary  anixter inc and paid for in usd 
sales to customers are invoiced in the local bolivar currency and bolivars are collected from customers to settle outstanding receivables 
during  local government restrictions made it increasingly difficult to transfer cash out of venezuela 
historically  the company utilized the parallel market which involves using bolivars to purchase venezuelan securities and then swap those securities for usd denominated investments to obtain usd to settle usd liabilities 
the use of this parallel market resulted in unfavorable foreign exchange rates as compared with the official rate in venezuela 
in december of  the venezuela operations remitted cash to its us parent using the parallel market  resulting in a million pre tax foreign exchange loss recorded during the fourth quarter of at the end of  as a result of the factors that led to increased usage of the parallel market  including the december cash remittance to the parent  the company re evaluated its historical practice of remeasuring bolivar denominated monetary assets primarily cash and accounts receivable into usd using the official exchange rate for financial reporting purposes 
the company determined that due to the change of circumstances described above  and the expected continued use of the parallel market for repatriating cash from venezuela  use of the parallel rate for remeasurement purposes was most appropriate 
the result of using the unfavorable parallel exchange rate to remeasure these assets was a million pre tax loss recorded during the fourth quarter of in may of  the venezuelan government suspended trading in the parallel market and replaced it with a system called transaction system for foreign currency denominated securities sitme  under the control of the central bank of venezuela 
under the new regulations  the company is limited to converting the venezuelan bolivar to usd at a rate of  per day  up to a maximum of  per month  as permitted by the central bank of venezuela 
the bolivar to usd exchange rate under sitme was adjusted to bolivars to one usd at july  as a result  during the second quarter of  the company recorded a pre tax foreign exchange gain of million due to the remeasurement of venezuela s bolivar denominated monetary assets at the rate determined by the government s newly regulated foreign currency exchange system 
the bolivar to usd exchange rate was bolivars to one usd at the end of and the rate at which the company obtains permission to repatriate cash through sitme varies and it is determined by the central bank 
the rate reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements is the average exchange rate obtained during the reporting period for transactions that the company executes through sitme 
the company often receives small approval amounts from the regulatory authority in venezuela at a rate of  however  the company doesn t consider this representative of the rate at which it can repatriate significant cash in a consistent manner 
therefore  the company doesn t use this rate for us gaap accounting 
interest rate risk the company uses interest rate swaps to reduce its exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates 
the objective of the currently outstanding interest rate swap cash flow hedge is to convert variable interest to fixed interest associated with forecasted interest payments resulting from revolving borrowings in the uk and is designated as a hedging instrument 
the company does not enter into interest rate swaps for speculative purposes 
changes in the value of the interest rate swap is expected to be highly effective in offsetting the changes attributable to fluctuations in the variable rates 
the company s counterparty to its interest rate swap contract has an investment grade credit rating 
the company expects the creditworthiness of its counterparty to remain intact through the term of the transactions 
the company regularly monitors the creditworthiness of its counterparty to ensure no issues exist which could affect the value of the derivatives 
when entered into  the financial instrument was designated a hedge of underlying exposures interest payments associated with the uk borrowings attributable to changes in the respective benchmark interest rate 
currently  the fair value of the interest rate swap is determined by means of a mathematical model that calculates the present value of the anticipated cash flows from the transaction using mid market prices and other economic data and assumptions  or by means of pricing indications from one or more other dealers selected at the discretion of the respective banks 
these inputs would be considered level in the fair value hierarchy described in recently issued accounting guidance on fair value measurements 
at december  and december   interest rate swaps were revalued at current interest rates  with the changes in valuation reflected directly in other comprehensive income loss in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the fair market value of the company s outstanding interest rate agreements  which is the estimated exit price that the company would pay to cancel the interest rate agreements  was not significant at december  or december  the company prepared a sensitivity analysis assuming a adverse change in interest rates 
holding all other variables constant  the hypothetical adverse change would have increased interest expense by million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
fair market value of debt instruments the fair value of the company s debt instruments is measured using observable market information which would be considered level in the fair value hierarchy described in recently issued accounting guidance on fair value measurements 
the carrying value of the company s nonconvertible fixed rate debt specifically  notes due and notes due was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the fair value of the nonconvertible fixed rate debt instruments was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the company s notes due and notes due bear interest at a fixed rate of and  respectively 
therefore  changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense incurred on the notes due or the notes due  but interest rates do affect the fair value 
if interest rates were to increase by  the fair market value of the notes due and the notes due would decrease by and at december  and at december   respectively 
if interest rates were to decrease by  the fair market value of the fixed rate debt would increase by and at december  and december   respectively 
the carrying value of the company s outstanding convertible fixed rate debt specifically  notes due and notes due was million at december  and million at december  during  the company retired its notes due as a result of repurchases and bondholder conversions 
as the company s outstanding convertible fixed rate debt may be converted into the company s common stock  the price of the company s common stock may affect the fair value of the company s convertible debt 
the estimated fair value of the company s outstanding convertible debt decreased to million at december  from million at december  the decline in the estimated fair value of the company s convertible debt is primarily due to the retirement of the notes due during fiscal a hypothetical increase in the price of the company s common stock from the price at december  and december  would have increased the fair value of its then outstanding convertible debt by million and million  respectively 
changes in the fair market value of the company s debt do not affect the reported results of operations unless the company is retiring such obligations prior to their maturity 
this analysis did not consider the effects of a changed level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment and certain other factors 
further  in the event of a change of this magnitude  management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to possible changes 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  this sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in the company s financial structure
