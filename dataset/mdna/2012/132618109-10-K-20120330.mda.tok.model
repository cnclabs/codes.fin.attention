item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general since its incorporation in  camco financial corporation camco or the corporation has evolved into a full service provider of financial products through its subsidiary  advantage bank advantage or bank 
utilizing a common marketing theme based on camco s commitment to personalized customer service  camco has grown from million of consolidated assets in to million of consolidated assets at december  camco s rate of growth is largely attributable to its acquisitions and its expansion of product lines from the limited deposit and loan offerings which the bank could offer in the heavily regulated environment of the s to the wider array of financial service products that commercial banks traditionally offer 
management believes that continued success in the financial services industry will be achieved by those institutions with a rigorous dedication to building value added customer oriented organizations 
toward this end  each of the bank s regions has the ability to make local decisions for customer contacts and services  however back office operations are consolidated and centralized 
based on consumer and business preferences  the bank s management designs financial service products with a view towards differentiating each of the constituent regions from its competition 
management believes that the bank regions ability to rapidly adapt to consumer and business needs and preferences is essential to them as community based financial institutions competing against the larger regional and money center bank holding companies 
camco s profitability depends primarily on its level of net interest income  which is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets  principally loans  mortgage backed securities and investment securities  and interest expense on deposit accounts and borrowings 
in recent years  camco s operations have also been heavily influenced by its level of other income  including mortgage banking income and other fee income 
camco s operations are also affected by general  administrative and other expenses  including employee compensation and benefits  occupancy expense  data processing  franchise taxes  advertising  other operating expenses and federal income tax expense 
overview during  the economic environment for financial services companies continued to be challenging 
bankruptcies  foreclosures and prolonged unemployment have continued and the oversupply of housing has depressed property values 
due to the decreased property values the government has expanded the harp program for borrowers that are current on their mortgages which enables them to refinance up to loan to value 
this coupled with interest rates decreasing in the fourth quarter of has created a higher loan application level but has also decreased the value of our mortgage servicing rights asset 
we continued to execute our long term strategic plan to diversify the balance sheet  improve delinquency  loan quality and our funding mix by reducing borrowings and increasing transaction based deposits 
in  total deposits decreased million or as we continued our goal of decreasing public funds and paying off all brokered deposits while increasing core deposit growth related to a number of organizational and product development initiatives which included our suite of commercial and small business checking accounts  online business cash management system  and remote deposit capture solutions 
we have continued to build our deposits with these new products and believe these products will continue to help us be more competitive for business checking accounts 
competition for deposits continues to put pressure on marginal funding costs  despite continued low rates in but our goal is to continue our strategy and build core customer accounts that are normally a lower cost of funding 
during  camco experienced improving trends in asset quality metrics 
nonperforming loans decreased million  or from million at december  to million at the end of net charge offs totaled million during compared to million during these decreases show that we continue to diligently manage our delinquencies and work with our loan customers in order to reduce losses for them  as well as our corporation 
additionally  the amount of classified loans has decreased not only due to charge off and sales of various assets  but also due to upgrading the loan quality ratings of various commercial loans related to improved borrower financial performance combined  in some cases  with restructured credit facilities which has resulted in lower provisions for loan losses 
the corporation engaged an investment banking firm in and has developed capital plan initiatives that may include balance sheet reduction  the sale of branches  issuing common stock  preferred stock  debt or some combination of those issuances  or other financing alternatives that will be treated as capital 
although  the corporation anticipates raising additional capital  the board of directors has not yet determined the type  timing  amount  or terms of possible securities to be issued in the offering  and there are no assurances that an offering will be completed or that the corporation will succeed in this endeavor 
in addition  a transaction  which would likely involve equity financing would result in substantial dilution to current stockholders and could adversely affect the price of the corporation s common stock 
we believe we are taking significant steps forward in managing our operational efficiency 
in  we launched online statements  a more convenient way of banking for many customers  and we are continuing our focus on improving noninterest income and controlling noninterest expense by refining our operations 
we continue to analyze new products to deepen relationships with our core customers and improve the structure of our balance sheet and create efficiency throughout 
on march   camco was notified by the frb that by march  it must divest of activities conducted pursuant to section k of the bhc act  which meant camco title agency  and that it must decertify as a financial holding company 
camco complied with this request by liquidating camco title agency and decertifying on march  after it decertified  camco remained a bank holding company and will continue to be regulated by the frb 
forward looking statements this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a and this annual report include forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of exchange act  as amended  which can be identified by the use of forward looking terminology  such as may  might  could  would  believe  expect  intend  plan  seek  anticipate  estimate  project or continue or the negative thereof or comparable terminology 
all statements other than statements of historical fact included in this document regarding our outlook  financial position and results of operation  liquidity  capital resources and interest rate sensitivity are forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements also include  but are not limited to anticipated changes in industry conditions created by state and federal legislation and regulations  anticipated changes in general interest rates and the impact of future interest rate changes on our profitability  capital adequacy and the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities  retention of our existing customer base and our ability to attract new customers  the development of new products and services and their success in the marketplace  the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  and  statements regarding our anticipated loan and deposit account growth  expense levels  liquidity and capital resources and projections of earnings 
these forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors which may cause our actual results to be materially different from any future results expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
although we believe the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  we can give no assurance such expectations will prove to have been correct 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements included herein include  but are not limited to competition in the industry and markets in which we operate  levels of non performing assets  changes in general interest rates  loan demand  rapid changes in technology affecting the financial services industry  real estate values  changes in government regulation  and general economic and business conditions 
this md a is intended to give stockholders a more comprehensive review of the issues facing management than could be obtained from an examination of the financial statements alone 
this analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes and the selected financial data elsewhere in this annual report 
as used herein and except as the context may otherwise require  references to camco  the corporation  we  us  or our means  collectively  camco financial corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary advantage bank 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as disclosures found elsewhere in this annual report  are based upon camco s consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires camco to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
several factors are considered in determining whether or not a policy is critical in the preparation of financial statements 
these factors include  among other things  whether the estimates are significant to the financial statements  the nature of the estimates  the ability to readily validate the estimates with other information including third parties or available prices  and sensitivity of the estimates to changes in economic conditions and whether alternative accounting methods may be utilized under us gaap 
material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses  the valuation of mortgage servicing rights and the valuation of deferred tax assets 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
summary 
we believe the accounting estimates related to the allowance for loan losses  the capitalization  amortization  and valuation of mortgage servicing rights and deferred income taxes are critical accounting estimates because the estimates are highly susceptible to change from period to period because they require us to make assumptions concerning the changes in the types and volumes of the portfolios  rates of future prepayments  and anticipated economic conditions  and the impact of recognizing an impairment or loan loss could have a material effect on camco s assets reported on the balance sheet as well as its net earnings 
allowance for loan losses the procedures for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses reflect management s evaluation of credit risk after careful consideration of all information available to management 
in developing this assessment  management must rely on estimates and exercise judgment regarding matters where the ultimate outcome is unknown such as economic factors  developments affecting companies in specific industries and issues with respect to single borrowers 
depending on changes in circumstances  future assessments of credit risk may yield materially different results  which may require an increase or a decrease in the allowance for loan losses 
each quarter  management analyzes the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses based on a review of the loans in the portfolio along with an analysis of external factors including current housing price depreciation  homeowners loss of equity  etc and historical delinquency and loss trends 
the allowance is developed through specific components  the specific allowance for loans subject to individual analysis  the allowance for classified loans not otherwise subject to individual analysis and the allowance for non classified loans primarily homogenous 
classified loans with indication or acknowledgment of deterioration are subject to individual analysis 
loan classifications are those used by regulators consisting of special mention  substandard  doubtful and loss 
in evaluating these loans for impairment  the measure of expected loss is based on the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  a loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
all other classified assets and non classified assets are combined with the homogenous loan pools and segregated into loan segments 
the segmentation is based on grouping loans with similar risk characteristics one to four family  home equity  etc loss rate factors are developed for each loan segment  which are used to estimate losses and determine an allowance 
the loss factors for each segment are derived from historical delinquency  classification  and charge off rates adjusted for economic factors and an estimated loss scenario 
the allowance is reviewed by management to determine whether the amount is considered adequate to absorb probablelosses to the loan portfolio 
management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is an estimate based on management s current judgment about the credit quality of the loan portfolio 
this evaluation includes specific loss estimates on certain individually reviewed loans  statistical loss estimates for loan pools that are based on historical loss experience  and general loss estimates that are based upon the size  quality  and concentration characteristics of the various loan portfolios  adverse situations that may affect a borrower s ability to repay  and current economic and industry conditions 
management also considers trends in delinquencies and loan losses for the bank specifically  the region  the nation  and other economic factors 
while the corporation strives to reflect all known risk factors in its evaluations  judgment errors may occur 
mortgage servicing rights to determine the fair value of its mortgage servicing rights msrs each reporting quarter  the corporation provides information representing loan information in each pooling period accompanied by escrow amounts to a third party valuation firm 
the third party then evaluates the possible impairment of msrs as described below 
msrs are recognized as separate assets or liabilities when loans are sold with servicing retained 
a pooling methodology  in which loans with similar characteristics are pooled together  is applied for valuation purposes 
once pooled  each group of loans is evaluated on a discounted earnings basis to determine the present value of future earnings that the bank expects to realize from the portfolio 
earnings are projected from a variety of sources including loan service fees  net interest earned on escrow balances  miscellaneous income and costs to service the loans 
the present value of future earnings is the estimated fair value for the pool  calculated using consensus assumptions that a third party purchaser would utilize in evaluating a potential acquisition of the msr s 
events that may significantly affect the estimates used are changes in interest rates and the related impact on mortgage loan prepayment speeds and the payment performance of the underlying loans 
the interest rate for net interest earned on escrow balances  which is supplied by management  takes into consideration the investment portfolio average yield as well as current short duration investment yields 
management believes this methodology provides a reasonable estimate 
mortgage loan prepayment speeds are calculated by a third party provider utilizing the economic outlook as published by the office of the chief economist of freddie mac in estimating prepayment speeds and provides a specific scenario with each evaluation 
based on the assumptions discussed  pre tax projections are prepared for each pool of loans serviced 
these earnings are used to calculate the approximate cash flow that could be received from the servicing portfolio 
valuation results are presented quarterly to management 
at that time  management reviews the information and msr s are marked to lower of amortized cost or fair value for the current quarter 
deferred income taxes camco recognizes expense for federal income taxes currently payable as well as for deferred federal taxes for estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets 
realization of a deferred tax asset is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in either the carry forward or carry back periods to cover net operating losses generated by the reversal of temporary differences 
a valuation allowance is provided by way of a charge to income tax expense if it is determined that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
if different assumptions and conditions were to prevail  the valuation allowance may not be adequate to absorb unrealized deferred taxes and the amount of income taxes payable may need to be adjusted by way of a charge to expense 
furthermore  income tax returns are subject to audit by the irs 
income tax expense for current and prior periods is subject to adjustment based upon the outcome of such audits 
camco believes it has adequately accrued for all probable income taxes payable 
accrual of income taxes payable and valuation allowances against deferred tax assets are estimates subject to change based upon the outcome of future events 
other real estate assets acquired through or instead of foreclosure  primarily other real estate owned  are initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired  establishing a new cost basis 
new real estate appraisals are generally obtained at the time of foreclosure and are used to establish fair value 
if fair value declines  a valuation allowance is recorded through expense 
estimating the initial and ongoing fair value of these properties involves a number of factors and judgments including holding time  costs to complete  holding costs  discount rate  absorption and other factors 
discussion of financial condition changes from december  to december  at december   camco s consolidated assets totaled million  a decrease of million  or  from the december  total 
the decrease in total assets was comprised primarily of decreases in loans receivable  fhlb stock and securities available for sale which were offset partially by the increase in cash and loans held for sale 
loans receivable has decreased due to continued paydowns and refinancing from adjustable rate to fixed rate loans 
our strategy of selling fixed rate product continues to shift the loan portfolio toward commercial loans 
current and upcoming loan rates may slow or increase residential lending and the sale of fixed rate loans 
due to the continued low interest rate environment over the past few years we believe that is not likely that the profits on gain on sale of mortgage loans will continue to be as strong in as the margins continue to decrease and many customers have already refinanced into the lower available rates 
possible growth in deposits  related to our strategic planning would most likely be used to reduce outstanding borrowings  purchase investments or fund commercial loan growth which is not expected until the second half of management continues its overall focus on managing credit  reducing risk within the loan portfolio and enhancing liquidity and capital in the current economic environment 
continuous progress is being made on addressing these issues  but we expect the distressed economic environment to continue through which may slow expectations 
cash and interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions totaled million at december  an increase of million  or  from december  levels 
cash has increased as we have begun to restructure the balance sheet by decreasing assets and liabilities when possible to improve our capital position in conjunction with ensuring on hand liquidity is adequate 
securities totaled million at december   a decrease of million  or  from december  due to the sale of million in securities  principal repayments and maturities of million offset partially by purchases of million which were primarily investment securities at a weighted rate of 
additionally  million of fhlb stock was redeemed during the first quarter of the securities portfolio has a weighted maturity that is relatively short in order to minimize extension risk 
we have purchased callable agencies to maximize yield and liquidity 
approximately million or of the portfolio has a callable option which management expects to be exercised during the year 
if the investments are not called  final maturity dates range from february  to june  at december   other than million of municipal bonds  all of our debt securities were issued and guaranteed by us government sponsored enterprises such as freddie mac  fannie mae  ginnie mae and the fhlb 
we held no private label mortgage backed securities or collateralized debt obligations 
loans receivable net and loans held for sale totaled million at december   a decrease of million  or  from the total at december  the decrease resulted primarily from principal repayments of million  loan sales of million and million of loans transferred to real estate owned offset partially by loan disbursements totaling million 
principal repayments are slightly higher than on loans and our ability to originate new loans in was not as strong as the reduction in residential real estate loan balances was intensified by the secondary market offering historically low long term fixed rates during most of and throughout many customers refinanced in when the rates originally dropped to record lows 
during  the average yield on loans was a decrease of basis points as compared to for the decrease in yield is due to lower average loan balances within our commercial and consumer loan portfolios  which are generally higher yielding assets 
this was coupled with lower effective rates in the loan portfolio during adjustable rate loans re priced lower in due to the current low rate environment and new loans are also being originated at these lower market rates 
the allowance for loan losses totaled million and million at december  and  respectively  representing and of nonperforming loans at those dates 
nonperforming loans three monthly payments or more delinquent plus nonaccrual loans totaled million and million at december  and  respectively  constituting and of total net loans  including loans held for sale  at those dates 
net charge offs totaled million for and were primarily comprised of million of residential real estate and million of commercial and non residential 
see note d to the financial statements for additional information 
the following table details delinquent and nonperforming loans at december  and loans days past due loans days past due non performing accruing loans or more days past due loans days past due loans days past due non performing accruing loans or more days past due in thousands construction land  farmland ag residential commercial consumer commercial and industrial multi family total initial un employment insurance claims are down slightly nationwide  in ohio and in our bank markets 
as of the fourth quarter of  ohio and the national un employment rates are identical at 
the average un employment rate in the bank s market areas decreased to when comparing third quarter to fourth quarter the labor force weighted un employment rate in the bank s markets is which is below the ohio average and the national average 
it is noted that the ohio un employment rate has declined for twenty consecutive months prior to august and again in the fourth quarter this indicates a slow  sustained economic recovery 
the corporation works with borrowers to avoid foreclosure if possible and we continue to aggressively work with borrowers to mitigate additional losses 
if it becomes inevitable that a borrower will not be able to retain ownership of their property  the corporation often seeks a deed in lieu of foreclosure in order to gain control of the property earlier in the recovery process 
the strategy of pursuing deeds in lieu of foreclosure should result in a reduction in the holding period for nonperforming assets and ultimately reduce economic losses 
at december   the corporation s real estate owned reo consisted of repossessed properties with a net book value of million compared to million at december  initial loss is recorded as a charge to the allowance for loan losses within days of being transferred to reo 
thereafter  if there is a further deterioration in value  a specific valuation allowance is established and charged to operations 
the corporation reflects costs to carry reo as period costs in operations when incurred 
when property is acquired through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure  it is initially recorded at the fair value of the related assets at the date of foreclosure  less estimated costs to sell the property 
deposits totaled million at december  a decrease of million  or from december  the following table details our deposit portfolio balances and the average rate paid on our deposit portfolio at december  and december  december  december  change in thousands balance rate balance rate balance rate noninterest bearing demand interest bearing demand money market savings certificates of deposit retail certificates of deposit brokered total deposits the decrease in deposits was primarily due to decreases in brokered and retail certificates of deposits offset partially by an increase in core relationships such as noninterest bearing demand and money markets 
we continue to focus and implement our strategy of improving the long term funding mix of the bank s deposit portfolio by developing deeper core relationships with small businesses  and adding commercial and retail checking accounts 
in  we implemented a number of organizational and product development initiatives including a new suite of commercial and small business checking accounts  enhancements to our online business cash management system  and the launch of a remote deposit capture solution 
in  we continued to build our deposits with these new products and believe these products will continue to help us be more competitive for acquiring new business checking accounts 
see liquidity and capital resources in this md a for further discussion on our deposit strategy and additional liquidity risks 
we continued to slightly reduce the rates offered on some of our accounts and feel we are competitive with current markets and are planning on continued strategic growth of core relationships 
we also believe that if we are able to maintain the majority of current customers that have retail certificates of deposit maturing in  we will continue to slightly decrease our cost of funds which will help costs of funds remain stable and possibly incur some reduction of costs related to such deposits in to reduce interest rate risk over the long term  we will continue our efforts to lengthen the duration of our deposit structure and our fhlb borrowings  but over the past few years it has not been the customers preference to lengthen such deposits in such a low interest rate environment 
in  all of our brokered deposits matured  which coupled with our strategy to continue growing core deposits will help maintain the bank s margin in we acknowledge that brokered deposits are not core  franchise enhancing deposits  and we intend to continue our strategy of improving the long term funding mix of the bank s deposit portfolio by growing small business  commercial and retail checking accounts 
in the future  we do not expect to use brokered deposits for liquidity position but they may be used as contingency funding if needed 
advances from the fhlb and other borrowings decreased by million  or  to a total of million at december  approximately million of advances are expected to mature in with a weighted rate of 
we plan to pay off the maturing advances as the corporation continues to focus on our strategy of growing and replacing a portion of these funding sources with core relationship deposits checking  savings  money market and cd accounts 
stockholders equity totaled million at december   decrease of  or from december  the increase resulted from net earnings of  coupled with  of stock based compensation expenses related to fas r which was offset by a million decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income related to the fair value of our investment securities as an unrealized gain was realized through the sale of securities 
see consolidated statements of stockholders equity on page for additional information 
during  management was notified by the fdic that for advantage to be categorized as adequately capitalized under the regulatory framework the bank must have tier leverage to average assets equating to 
to be categorized as adequately capitalized camco and advantage must maintain this minimum capital ratio per the fdic 
at december  the bank s tier leverage to average assets was 
a failure to comply with the capital directive could result in additional enforcement actions by the fdic or the division 
comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and december  general 
camco s net earnings of  or per share for the year ended december   increased from the net loss of million  or per share for the same period in the increase in earnings was primarily attributable to decreased provision for losses on loans  increased gain on sale of investments  increased rent and other offset partially by increased expenses related to other real estate owned  decreased gain on sale of loans and title fees 
net interest income 
net interest income for the year ended december   amounted to million  an increase of  or  compared to  generally reflecting the effects of re pricing of liabilities in the current lower interest rate environment 
net interest margin increased basis points to for the twelve months ending december  compared to for the comparable period in the increase in net interest margin during the period  compared to the same period of  was due primarily to a lower cost of interest bearing liabilities in the period offset partially by a lower volume of interest earning assets and a lower yield on those assets 
we have continued with our strategies and offset decreased interest earned by decreasing the balances of our borrowed funds when applicable 
additionally  we continue to re price deposits on a year to year comparison  which helped reduce overall deposit funding costs by basis points throughout our strategy is to continue to maintain cost of funds by increasing deposits related to our commercial relationships instead of borrowing at higher yields 
interest income on loans totaled million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  from the comparable total 
the decrease resulted primarily from a basis point decrease in the average yield  from in  to in  coupled with a million  or  decrease in the average balance of loans outstanding year to year 
interest income on securities totaled  for the year ended december   a million  or decrease from the period 
the decrease was due primarily to a million  or decrease in the average balance outstanding  coupled with a basis point decrease in the average yield  to in interest income on fhlb stock decreased by  or  due primarily to a decrease in the average balance outstanding of million or in interest income on other interest bearing deposits increased by  or  due to a million or increase in the average balance outstanding year to year 
interest expense on deposits totaled million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  compared to the year ended december  this was due primarily to a basis point decrease in the average cost of deposits  to for  coupled with a million  or  decrease in the average balance of interest bearing deposits outstanding year to year 
interest expense on borrowings totaled million for the year ended december   a decrease of  or  from the decrease resulted primarily from a million  or decrease in the average balance outstanding year to year offset partially by a basis point increase in the average rate to in approximately million  or  of our certificate deposit portfolio will mature during while this presents an opportunity to continue reducing our cost of funds as these deposits are re pricing into a slightly lower interest rate environment we continue to experience competition for deposits in our market areas 
this competition is limiting our ability to further reduce the marginal cost of deposits to a level reflective of the general rate environment 
continued decreases in interest rates could compress our net interest margin due to continued re pricing between our loan and deposit portfolios 
at the same time  the loan portfolio has not grown enough to offset these tighter spreads 
as noted earlier  we plan to continue to diversify the loan portfolio by encouraging growth in commercial and consumer loan balances 
this strategy should slow net interest margin compression as these types of loans are normally higher yielding assets than conventional mortgage loans and investment securities 
provision for losses on loans 
a provision for losses on loans is charged to earnings to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level considered appropriate by management based on historical experience  the volume and type of lending conducted by the bank  the status of past due principal and interest payments  general economic conditions  particularly as such conditions relate to the bank s market areas  and other factors related to the collectability of the bank s loan portfolio 
key drivers of and reported provisions related to declines in commercial real estate values on impaired loans and loan downgrades 
the higher allocation in recent years primarily reflected the impact of distressed commercial real estate values and general economic conditions on specific reserves for impaired loans  while the elevated level of charge offs in those years resulted in higher loss factors related to classified loans and has carried over into the allowance allocated to the real estate and consumer loan categories is based upon camco s allowance methodology for homogeneous pools of loans 
the decreased allowance for loan losses relates to fluctuations and changes in these allocations which are consistent with the improvement in loan quality  loss experience and economic factors in each of the loan categories 
nonperforming loans three monthly payments or more delinquent plus nonaccrual loans totaled million at december   a decrease of million from million at december  additionally  net charge offs decreased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in the allowance from december  to december  was significantly related to charge offs recognized in that were specific to certain impaired loans 
based upon an analysis of these factors and the continued decrease of nonperforming loans  million was added to the allowance for losses on loans for the twelve months ended december   compared to million for the same period in we believe our loan loss reserve is adequate as of december  however  there can be no assurance that the loan loss allowance will be adequate to absorb losses on known classified assets or that the allowance will be adequate to cover losses in the future  understanding that all lending activity contains associated risks of loan losses 
in addition  the mix and composition of both portfolio loans and nonperforming loans change from period to period 
when the company analyzes the allowance for loan losses various ratios are considered 
as of december  the ratio of allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans decreased slightly from the prior year and our loan reserves also decreased  representing of total net loans versus at december  other income 
other income totaled million for the year ended december   a decrease of  or  compared to the decrease in other income was primarily attributable to a million decrease in the gain on sale of loans and a  decrease in title fees offset partially by a million increase in gains on sales of investments 
the decrease in gain on sale of loans was due to the sale of four portfolio loans at a loss of  which was offset by our current year to date gain on the sale of our mortgage banking activity of  which was a decrease of  from the period 
the decrease in mortgage banking activity was due to a million decrease in loan sales year to year 
general  administrative and other expense 
general  administrative and other expense totaled million for the year ended december  the total expense year to year was primarily unchanged but there were decreases in loan expense  employee compensation and benefits  fdic premiums and franchise taxes 
these decreases were offset partially by increases in real estate owned expenses 
the decrease in loan expenses was due to higher than normal legal expenses incurred in relating to classified commercial assets and the costs of various consulting  legal and property management services necessary to properly assist management in the workout and or foreclosure process and safeguarding of assets 
employee compensation and benefits decreased primarily due to a decrease in the total number of employees  costs related to insurance benefit expenses and incentives related to decreased commercial originations year to year 
the corporation has made it a priority to identify cost savings opportunities throughout its operations and is committed to maintaining cost control measures  believing that the effort will play a major role in improving its performance 
franchise taxes are calculated utilizing equity levels 
the decrease in expense relates to decreased equity levels 
camco filed a form s on july  for a potential rights offering with a proposed maximum aggregate offering price of million 
if camco pursues the rights offering its franchise taxes will increase due to an increase in equity 
the increase in real estate owned and other expenses is reflective of falling real estate values that have negatively impacted our portfolio value and caused write down to lower cost of market on properties held 
in addition  the increase in properties taken into real estate owned due to foreclosures in resulted in increased expenses 
as noted earlier  home values in ohio have continued to be lower than previous levels 
these factors compounded by an uncertain economic outlook  high unemployment and the market having excessive amounts of properties available may result in continued expenses going into federal income taxes 
federal income taxes totaled  for the year ended december   an increase of  compared to the provision recorded in this increase reflects the change in the valuation allowance against the corporation s net deferred tax asset 
in  the corporation sold available for sale investments that were no longer carrying a deferred position and recorded tax expense related to such transactions 
the corporation recorded a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset in based on the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
in making such judgments  significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
a cumulative tax loss position is considered significant negative evidence in assessing the realization of a net deferred tax asset  which is difficult to overcome 
reversal of the valuation allowance can be realized in the future based on estimates of projected taxable income 
the corporation has a net operating loss carry forward for tax purposes of approximately million at december  this compares to a net operating loss carry forward of approximately million at december  the net operating loss carry forward was substantially reduced during as the corporation generated approximately million of taxable income during that period  primarily due to the redemption of the fhlb stock which resulted in taxable income of approximately million 
comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and december  general 
camco s net loss of million  or per share for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million  or per share for the same period in the increase in the net loss primarily reflects a decrease in other income related to the valuation of mortgage servicing rights an increase in general administrative and other expense and a valuation on our deferred tax asset  offset partially by increased net interest income 
additionally  camco continued to increase provisions as high levels of charge offs continued in this was reflective of the impact of the distressed commercial real estate values and general economic conditions 
net interest income 
net interest income for the year ended december   amounted to million  an increase of million  or  compared to  generally reflecting the effects of re pricing of liabilities in the current lower interest rate environment 
net interest margin increased basis points to for the twelve months ending december  compared to for the comparable period in the increase in net interest margin during the period  compared to the same period of  was due primarily to a lower cost of interest bearing liabilities in the period offset partially by a lower yield on those assets 
margin pressure continued in due to the yield on assets continuing to decline 
we continued with our strategies and offset decreased interest earned by decreasing the balances of our borrowed funds when applicable 
additionally  we continued to re price deposits on a year to year comparison  which helped reduce overall deposit funding costs by basis points throughout we also continued to maintain cost of funds by increasing deposits related to our commercial relationships and retrieving deposits instead of borrowing at higher yields 
interest income on loans totaled million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  from the comparable total 
the decrease resulted primarily from a basis point decrease in the average yield  from in  to in  coupled with a million  or  decrease in the average balance of loans outstanding year to year 
interest income on securities totaled million for the year ended december   a million  or  decrease from the period

interest expense on borrowings totaled million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  from the decrease resulted primarily from a million  or  decrease in the average balance outstanding year to year coupled with a basis point decrease in the average rate to in approximately million  or  of our certificate deposit portfolio matured during while this presented an opportunity to continue reducing our cost of funds as these deposits are re pricing into a slightly lower interest rate environment we continued to experience competition for deposits in our market areas 
the competition limited our ability to further reduce the marginal cost of deposits to a level reflective of the general rate environment 
provision for losses on loans 
nonperforming loans three monthly payments or more delinquent plus nonaccrual loans totaled million at december   a slight increase from million from december  additionally  net charge offs totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  based upon an analysis of these factors and the continued uncertain economic outlook  we added million to the allowance for losses on loans for the twelve months ended december   compared to million for the same period in as of december  the ratio of allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans increased from the prior year and our loan reserves also increased  representing of total net loans versus at december  other income 
other income totaled million for the year ended december   a decrease of  or  compared to the decrease in other income was primarily attributable to a million decrease in the value of our mortgage servicing rights net offset partially by a  increase in gains on sales of loans 
the decrease in mortgage servicing rights net was due to increased volatility in the market  which in turn increased the prepayment speeds utilized to value the portfolio 
at december   we serviced million of one to four family residential mortgage loans for others  primarily freddie mac and fannie mae  which declined slightly from million at december  the increase in gain on sale of loans income for was due to increased spread on the gain achieved per loan offset partially be a decrease in loan sales of million  or compared to the prior year 
general  administrative and other expense 
general  administrative and other expense totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to the increase was due primarily to a  increase in loan expenses  a  increase in real estate owned and other expense and a  increase in employee compensation and benefits expense 
these increases were offset partially by a decrease of fdic insurance of  and decreases of  in occupancy and equipment and  in postage supplies and offices expense 
the increase in loan expenses relates to legal expenses incurred relating to classified commercial assets and the costs of various consulting  legal and property management services necessary to properly assist management in the workout and or foreclosure process and safeguarding of assets 
management has spent significant time and resources in workout initiatives for problem loans in order to mitigate their adverse impact on the balance sheet and operating results 
the increase in real estate owned and other expenses is reflective of falling real estate values that negatively impacted our portfolio value and caused write down to fair market value on properties held 
in addition  the increase in properties taken into real estate owned due to foreclosures in resulted in increased expenses 
as noted earlier home values in ohio have continued to decline from previous levels 
employee compensation and benefits increased primarily due to normal merit increases  an increase in incentives related to commercial originations coupled with increased salary continuation and defined benefit retirement plan costs 
the decrease in fdic premiums resulted from the non recurrence of certain expenses including the reorganization of the deposit insurance fund assessment of premiums by the fdic 
this was coupled with increased premium rates which occurred in in november  the fdic issued a final rule to implement provisions of the dodd frank act that provide for temporary unlimited coverage for non interest bearing transaction accounts 
the separate coverage for non interest bearing transaction accounts became effective on december  and terminates on december  the decrease in occupancy and equipment was due to decreased depreciation and repairs 
the decreases in postage  supplies and office expenses relates to including additional incurred expenses related to the termination of a merger and additional re advertising of our branches and brand and re ordering of pre printed materials and supplies to regular inventory levels 
federal income taxes 
the federal income taxes totaled  for the year ended december   an increase of million  compared to the benefit provision recorded in during the third quarter of  management performed an analysis on its deferred tax assets and determined a full valuation allowance was necessary 
the year increase reflected a valuation allowance on the corporation s deferred tax asset 
as the corporation executes plans to return to profitability  future earnings will benefit from operating loss carry forwards 
a valuation allowance is recognized for a deferred tax asset if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
in making such judgments  significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
as a result of the increased credit losses  the consequence to the bank resulted in a carry forward loss position as of december  a cumulative loss position is considered significant negative evidence in assessing the realization of a deferred tax asset  which is difficult to overcome 
reversal of the valuation allowance is possible in the future when the corporation returns to profitability

liquidity and capital resources liquidity is the corporation s ability to generate adequate cash flows to meet the demands of its customers and provide adequate flexibility for the corporation to take advantage of market opportunities 
cash is used to fund loans  purchase investments  fund the maturity of liabilities  and at times to fund deposit outflows and operating activities 
the corporation s principal sources of funds are deposits  amortization  prepayments and sales of loans  maturities  sales and principal receipts from securities  borrowings  and operations 
managing liquidity entails balancing the need for cash or the ability to borrow against the objectives of maximizing profitability and minimizing interest rate risk 
the most liquid types of assets typically carry the lowest yields 
camco is a single bank holding company and its primary ongoing source of liquidity is from dividends received from the bank 
currently  the consent order prohibits the bank from paying a dividend to camco without prior approval of the fdic and division 
further  as a result of entering into the written agreement  and mou with the frb on march   we are prohibited from paying dividends to our stockholders without first obtaining the approval of the frb 
camco currently has million outstanding trust preferred securities with a maturity date of if needed  camco s agreement regarding these securities provides for a deferment of interest payment for up to consecutive quarters without default 
based on notification received from the frb on april   camco was required to exercise this provision to defer interest payments and has deferred a total of eleven quarters as of december  see note k to the financial statements in item below 
if the corporation desires to raise funds in the future  it may consider engaging in further offerings of preferred securities  debentures or other borrowings as well as issuance of capital stock  but any such strategic decisions would require regulatory approval 
our ability to pay dividends to stockholders is dependent on our net earnings 
a continued decline in earnings  increases in loan losses  or higher regulatory capital reserve requirements may continue to jeopardize our ability to pay dividends at historical levels 
we monitor and assess liquidity needs daily in order to meet deposit withdrawals  loan commitments and expenses 
camco s liquidity contingency funding plan identifies liquidity thresholds and red flags that may evidence liquidity concerns or future crises 
the contingency plan details specific actions to be taken by management and the board of directors 
it also identifies sources of emergency liquidity  both asset and liability based  should we encounter a liquidity crisis 
in conjunction with the corporation s asset liability and interest rate risk management activities  we actively monitor liquidity risk and analyze various scenarios that could impact or impair camco s ability to access emergency funding during a liquidity crisis 
liquid assets consist of cash and interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions  investments and mortgage backed securities 
approximately million  or  of our investment portfolio is expected to mature  prepay or be called during these maturities could provide a significant source of liquidity 
state and local political subdivision investments equaled million at december   and million at december  we may implement additional product strategies to lessen this restriction on our investment portfolio to increase our liquidity options 
additional sources of liquidity include deposits  borrowings and principal and interest repayments on loans 
while scheduled loan repayments and maturing investments are relatively predictable  deposit flows and early loan and security prepayments are more influenced by interest rates  general economic conditions  and competition and are difficult to predict 
diversified and reliable sources of wholesale funds are utilized to augment core deposit funding 
borrowings may be used to compensate for reduction in other sources of funds or to support lending activities 
the bank utilizes certain loans and fhlb stock to provide collateral to support its borrowing needs 
however  depositor or counterparty behavior could change in response to competition  economic or market situations or other unforeseen circumstances  which could have liquidity implications that may require different strategic or operational actions 
one source of wholesale funding is brokered deposits 
consistent with its risk management policy and in response to the general tightening of credit and liquidity conditions in the financial markets at large  in the past  the bank has utilized brokered deposits  however  at december   camco did not have any such deposits  exclusive of cdars deposits 
approximately million of the corporation s certificate of deposit portfolio is scheduled to mature during depositors continue a preference toward short term certificates or other issuances less than months 
this places additional liquidity pressure on the corporation as competition for deposits is very strong in ohio  kentucky and west virginia 
a material loss of these short term deposits could force us to seek funding through contingency sources  which may negatively impact earnings 
fhlb advances are another funding source 
in the past  camco has depended heavily on borrowings to fund balance sheet growth 
while significant strategic and tactical focus is currently being placed on deposit growth  borrowings and additional borrowing capacity at the fhlb are vital sources of liquidity 
we have approximately million of additional borrowing capacity available as of december  however  our total borrowing capacity at the fhlb is dependent on the level of eligible collateral assets held by the bank and the bank s credit rating with the fhlb 
our total borrowing capacity with the fhlb has decreased to million at december   from million at december  this capacity is based on the pledging of our one to four family  multi family mortgage  commercial real estate and home equity lines of credit 
we plan to continue to monitor our funding sources  but recognize that our current credit risk profile may restrict these sources 
our funds management group will monitor deposit rates in our markets to allow for competitive pricing to raise funds while also monitoring loan activity to provide for the liquidity needs of the bank 
the following table sets forth information regarding the bank s obligations and commitments to make future payments under contract as of december  payments due by period less than year years years more than years total in thousands contractual obligations operating lease obligations advances from the federal home loan bank repurchase agreements certificates of deposit subordinated debentures ohio equity funds for affordable housing deferred compensation amount of commitments per period commitments to originate loans revolving  open end lines family residential construction commercial real estate  other construction loan and land development loans commercial real estate  construction  and land development loans not secured by real estate other unused commitments stand by letters of credit total contractual obligations the subordinated debentures are redeemable at par  at camco s option  commencing september  the debentures mature on september  we anticipate that we will have sufficient funds available to meet our current loan commitments 
based upon historical deposit flow data  the bank s competitive pricing in its market and management s experience  we believe that a significant portion of our core maturing certificates of deposit in will remain with the bank  but recognize the significance of the risks discussed above 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term management process 
in the event that we should require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally  additional funds are available through the use of fhlb advances  internet deposits  and through the sales of loans and or securities 
off balance sheet arrangements we engage in off balance sheet credit related activities that could require us to make cash payments in the event that specified future events occur 
the contractual amounts of these activities represent the maximum exposure to the bank as further described in financial statement footnote note j commitments 
however  certain off balance sheet commitments are expected to expire or be only partially used  therefore  the total amount of commitments does not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
these off balance sheet activities are necessary to meet the financing needs of the bank s customers
