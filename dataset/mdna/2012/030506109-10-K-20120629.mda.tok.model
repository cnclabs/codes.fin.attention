overview american woodmark corporation manufactures and distributes kitchen cabinets and vanities for the remodeling and new home construction markets 
its products are sold on a national basis directly to home centers  major builders and home manufacturers and through a network of independent dealers and distributors 
at april   the company operated manufacturing facilities and service centers across the country 
during the company s fiscal year that ended on april  fiscal  the company experienced a continuation of difficult housing market conditions that have prevailed since the housing market peaked in  although the outlook has begun to trend more positively 
positive factors included creation of approximately million private sector jobs in the us during the company s fiscal according to the us department of labor  creation of over million new us households during calendar  compared with less than million new households during the two preceding years combined according to the us census bureau  an improvement in gross private residential fixed investment reported by the us department of commerce during the first quarter of calendar  compared with the same quarter one year ago  and increases in total housing starts and single family housing starts during the company s fiscal of and  respectively  as compared to the company s fiscal  according to the us department of commerce 
negative factors included the median price of existing homes sold in the us declined for the th consecutive year during the company s fiscal  according to data provided by the national association of realtors  consumer confidence  as reported by the university of michigan  averaged a lower level during the company s fiscal than in fiscal  and cabinet sales  as reported by members of the kitchen cabinet manufacturers association kcma  increased by less than during fiscal  inclusive of increased new construction sales and therefore indicative of lower remodeling sales 
faced with these challenging market conditions  the company s largest remodeling customers and competitors continued to utilize an elevated level of sales promotions in the company s product category during fiscal to boost sales 
these promotions consisted of free products and cash discounts to consumers based upon the amount and or type of cabinets they purchased 
the company also continued to participate in these promotional activities in order to remain competitive with competitors promotional offerings which have generally been richer than those offered by the company 
price conscious consumers generally responded to these promotional offerings  helping the company to gain market share and realize increased sales volumes in fiscal the company s remodeling sales increased at a mid single digit pace during fiscal in a remodeling market that appears to have declined from the prior year 
despite market conditions that continue to be well below normal levels  the company increased its net sales by during fiscal the company realized strong sales gains in its new construction channel during fiscal  where sales increased by more than  significantly outpacing the improvement in single family housing starts 
management believes this result  combined with the company s increased remodeling sales  indicates the company realized market share gains in both of its sales channels during fiscal during the third quarter of fiscal  the company announced several initiatives designed to reduce its manufacturing capacity and its cost base  including the permanent closure of two manufacturing plants  the decision to place a previously closed manufacturing facility for sale  and the realignment of its retirement program  including the freezing of its pension plans 
restructuring charges related to these actions have been reflected in the company s results 
gross margin for fiscal was  up from in fiscal the increase in the company s gross margin rate was driven by the beneficial impact of increased sales volume upon direct labor and manufacturing overhead costs  which more than offset the impact of rising materials  freight and sales promotional costs 
although the present housing market downturn has continued at historic low levels of market activity  the company believes that the long term fundamentals for the american housing industry continue to remain positive  based upon continued population growth  job creation and household formation 
based upon this belief  the company has continued to invest in improving its operations and its capabilities to service its customers 
the company remains focused on growing its market share and has continued to invest in developing and launching new products and expanding its marketing reach to new customers 
the company regularly assesses its long lived assets to determine if any impairment has occurred and regularly evaluates its deferred tax assets to determine whether a valuation allowance is necessary 
although the company generated an operating loss in fiscal in what may have been the bottom of the housing market  the company expects that a combination of continued market share gains and lower costs resulting from its recent restructuring actions will enable it to return to profitability commencing with fiscal as a result of its restructuring initiatives  the company recorded total pre tax restructuring costs of million during fiscal  including a pre tax impairment charge of million related to three of its manufacturing facilities that have been included in restructuring initiatives 
the company has concluded that none of the long lived assets pertaining to its other remaining manufacturing plants or any of its other long lived assets were impaired and that no valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets was necessary as of april  restructuring charges recorded in connection with the company s cost reduction initiatives aggregated million net of tax in fiscal  million net of tax in fiscal and million net of tax in fiscal exclusive of these charges  the company generated a net loss of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal results of operations fiscal years ended april in thousands vs

sales promotions generally involved the use of free products or cash reimbursements back to the company s large retail customers and were deducted from gross margin as opposed to being classified as operating expenses 
during fiscal  the company s gross profit declined as a percentage of net sales from in fiscal to in fiscal the impact of increased sales volume in fiscal created improved labor efficiencies and more favorable absorption of manufacturing overhead costs  which were more than offset by increased sales promotion costs  material costs and diesel fuel

general administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased by million  or  compared with fiscal and represented of net sales  compared with of net sales for fiscal the majority of the cost increase was related to increased pay for performance compensation 
general and administrative expenses in fiscal declined by million or  compared with fiscal and represented of net sales  as compared with of net sales for fiscal the majority of the decline was related to a reduction in incentive compensation and reduced bad debt and related costs pertaining to insolvent customers 
as of both april  and  the company had receivables from customers with a higher perceived level of risk aggregating less than million 
effective income tax rates the company generated a pre tax loss of million during fiscal  including million of restructuring charges 
the company s effective tax rate increased from in fiscal to in fiscal  driven primarily by the impact of a tax basis adjustment  changes driven by restructuring charges  and the absence of favorability that occurred in fiscal relating to a loss carryback 
outlook for fiscal the company follows several indices  including but not limited to housing starts  existing home sales  mortgage interest rates  new jobs growth  gdp growth and consumer confidence that it believes are leading indicators of overall demand for kitchen and bath cabinetry 
the company believes that while these indicators collectively suggest the long term economic outlook for housing is positive  the near term outlook for housing remains subdued 
the company expects that the us economy will continue to grow  that job creation will continue  and that the prices for existing homes will finally bottom during fiscal for fiscal  the company expects that the median price of existing homes sold will be flat with that of fiscal  and that industry wide cabinet remodeling sales will be roughly flat in fiscal after several years of declines 
the company expects that its remodeling market share will be stable in fiscal and that its remodeling unit sales will therefore approximate those of fiscal the company expects that single family housing starts will continue to grow at a mid single digit rate during fiscal the company grew its new construction market share significantly during fiscal and expects that it will be able to grow its new construction sales at a high single digit rate in fiscal in a market that seems poised to grow at a slightly lesser rate 
inclusive of the potential for modest sales mix and pricing improvements  the company expects that it will grow its sales at a mid single digit rate in fiscal the company s operating loss exclusive of restructuring charges was million in fiscal the company expects that the savings realized from its fiscal restructuring will approximate this amount  creating the ability to break even absent any sales growth 
because of the sales growth that is expected to occur  the company expects to return to profitability during fiscal  inclusive of expected adverse impacts from a continuing rise in material costs 
the company plans to increase its capital expenditures from million in fiscal to approximately million in fiscal  driven by increasing the number of sales display units deployed with customers and investing in machinery and equipment to enable production volume to increase 
the company expects that its operating cash flow may decline  driven by the elimination of income tax refunds  increased pension plan funding requirements and increased working capital usage as the company s sales grow 
additional risks and uncertainties that could affect the company s results of operations and financial condition are discussed elsewhere in this report  including under forward looking statements  elsewhere in management s discussion and analysis and also in the company s annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended april  filed with the sec  under item a  risk factors and item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk liquidity and capital resources the company s cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash totaled million at april   which represented an increase of million from april  total debt was million at april   million lower than in the prior fiscal year and long term debt  excluding current maturities  to capital was at april   up from at april  the company s main source of liquidity is its cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash generated from its operating activities 
the company maintains a million secured revolving credit facility with wells fargo bank  n 
a 
wells fargo 
pursuant to the terms of the wells fargo credit facility  at april   million of the company s cash served as security for borrowings under this facility and was classified as restricted cash 
operating activities primarily because of its non cash operating expenses that are included in net income  the company s cash provided by operating activities has historically been considerably higher than the company s net income 
during the three year period ended april   the company generated a total of million in cash from operating activities  as compared with a cumulative net loss during this period of million 
of the million difference between these two amounts  million related to non cash depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation expense 
cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was million  compared with million in fiscal the million improvement was primarily attributable to the reduction in the company s operating loss exclusive of restructuring charges of million 
this improvement was offset in part by reductions in proceeds from income tax refunds of million  from increasing funding to its pension plans of million  and from funding restructuring costs of million 
cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was million  compared with million in fiscal the million increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to the million decrease in net loss  proceeds of million collected from income tax refunds and the absence of payments made in relation to the company s cost reduction initiatives in the prior fiscal year of approximately million 
a million increase in the company s net working capital investment in inventory and customer receivables partially offset these improvements 
investing activities the company s investing activities primarily consist of capital expenditures and investments in promotional displays 
net cash used by investing activities in fiscal was million  compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal investments in property  plant and equipment for fiscal were million  compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal investments in promotional displays were million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal during fiscal  the company s increased investment in capital expenditures was driven by machinery purchases that helped enable the recent plant closures to occur 
the remainder of the increase in net cash invested during fiscal was due to the absence of million of proceeds received during fiscal from the sale of two previously closed manufacturing plants 
the company generated positive free cash flow defined as cash provided by operating activities less cash used for investing activities of million during fiscal  compared with positive million in fiscal and negative million in fiscal the reduction in fiscal was driven by increased net outflows used for investing activities that more than offset net improvements in cash provided by operating activities 
exclusive of the adverse change in tax refunds  pension contributions  cash used for restructuring activities and declines due to building sale proceeds  free cash flow generated during fiscal improved by approximately million compared with fiscal the improvement in fiscal compared with fiscal of million was primarily driven by the absence of cash paid for restructuring activities aggregating million  coupled with a reduction in net cash used for investing activities of million 
financing activities the company s financing activities have typically consisted of returning a portion of its free cash flow to its shareholders in the form of cash dividends and repayments of debt  net of any proceeds received from the exercise of stock options 
the company provided million from financing activities in fiscal  compared with using million for financing activities in fiscal the primary financing activity that generated cash in fiscal was the release of million of restricted cash previously used to secure the company s credit facility 
the company s outflows of million to service its debt and million to pay dividends served to reduce the net cash flow from financing activities to million in fiscal the company used million for financing activities in fiscal  including million to pay dividends and million to service its debt  offset in part by proceeds received from issuance of its common stock 
the company used million for financing activities in fiscal  driven by having million of its cash become restricted as security for its credit facility and paying dividends of million 
despite the company s strong liquidity and positive free cash flow  the company s assessment of the us economy and the continued difficulties in the housing market caused it to suspend its dividend and restructure its operations during fiscal as a result of these actions  the company believes that it has the capability to operate profitably  generate satisfactory levels of operating cash flow to fund increased levels of capital expenditures  and still have ample remaining manufacturing capacity to grow its sales revenue by approximately from present levels 
to the extent that the company determines that it is carrying excess cash in relation to its future operational and other needs  then the company s board of directors will consider returning some or all of the excess cash to its shareholders in the form of either stock repurchases or future dividends 
the company is authorized to repurchase its stock under an authorization approved by its board of directors in of up to million 
the company made no stock repurchases in fiscal or the company can borrow up to million under the wells fargo credit facility  however  the company must maintain cash and specified investments held in accounts pledged to wells fargo having a collateral value of at least of the company s aggregate indebtedness and other obligations to wells fargo 
at april   million of loans and million of letters of credit were outstanding under the wells fargo facility and million of the company s cash was held as security 
on may   the company and wells fargo amended the credit facility and modified related security arrangements 
effective as of april   the amount of cash and securities required to be held as security was reduced from to of the company s outstanding indebtedness and other obligations to wells fargo 
as a result  the company s restricted cash was reduced by million to million as of the fiscal year end 
the company also agreed to pledge substantially all of its assets as security for the company s indebtedness and other obligations to wells fargo 
effective as of may   the amendment to the credit facility reduced the allowable ratio of the company s total liabilities to its tangible net worth to a maximum of to at the end of each fiscal quarter  added a requirement for the company to maintain a ratio of cash flow to fixed charges of not less than to at the end of each fiscal quarter on a rolling four quarter basis and added a requirement that the company maintain an asset coverage ratio of not less than to at the end of each calendar month 
the company was in compliance with all covenants specified in the amended credit facility as of april   as follows the company s ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth at april  was to  cash flow to fixed charges for its most recent four quarters was to  and its asset coverage ratio as of april  was to the credit facility does not limit the company s ability to use unrestricted cash to pay dividends or repurchase its common stock as long as the company is in compliance with these covenants 
cash flow from operations combined with accumulated cash and cash equivalents on hand are expected to be more than sufficient to support forecasted working capital requirements  service existing debt obligations and fund capital expenditures for fiscal the timing of the company s contractual obligations as of april  is summarized in the table below fiscal years ended april in thousands total amounts and thereafter revolving credit facility economic development loans term loans capital lease obligations interest on long term debt operating lease obligations pension contributions total interest commitments under interest bearing debt consist of interest under the company s primary loan agreement  term loans and capitalized lease agreements 
amounts outstanding under the company s revolving credit facility  million at april   bears a variable interest rate determined by the london interbank offered rate libor plus 
interest under the company s term loans and capitalized lease agreements is fixed at rates between and 
interest commitments under interest bearing debt for the company s revolving credit facility are at libor plus the spread as of april   throughout the remaining term of the facility 
the estimated cost of the company s two defined benefit pension plans is determined annually based upon the discount rate and other assumptions at fiscal year end 
future pension funding contributions beyond have not been determined at this time 
market risks the company s business has historically been subjected to seasonal influences  with higher sales typically realized in the second and fourth fiscal quarters 
the costs of the company s products are subject to inflationary pressures and commodity price fluctuations 
the company has generally been able  over time  to recover the effects of inflation and commodity price fluctuations through sales price increases 
on april   the company had no material exposure to changes in interest rates for its debt agreements 
the company does not currently use commodity or interest rate derivatives or similar financial instruments to manage its commodity price or interest rate risks 
for additional discussion of risks that could affect the company and its business  see forward looking statements above and risk factors in the company s most recent annual report on form k filed with the sec 
off balance sheet arrangements as of april  and  the company had no off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies management has chosen accounting policies that are necessary to give reasonable assurance that the company s operational results and financial position are accurately and fairly reported 
the significant accounting policies of the company are disclosed in note a to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
the following discussion addresses the accounting policies that management believes have the greatest potential impact on the presentation of the financial condition and operating results of the company for the periods being reported and that require the most judgment 
management regularly reviews these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
long lived asset impairment 
the company reviews its long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
for purposes of assessing if impairment exists  assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets 
to determine whether an impairment has occurred  the company compares estimates of the future undiscounted net cash flows of groups of assets to their carrying values 
the company has not recognized impairments of long lived assets in the last three years other than the impairments related to restructuring activities 
revenue recognition 
the company utilizes signed sales agreements that provide for transfer of title to the customer upon delivery 
the company must estimate the amount of sales that have been transferred to third party carriers but not delivered to customers 
the estimate is calculated using a lag factor determined by analyzing the actual difference between shipment date and delivery date of orders over the past months 
revenue is only recognized on those shipments which the company believes have been delivered to the customer 
the company recognizes revenue based on the invoice price less allowances for sales returns  cash discounts and other deductions as required under us generally accepted accounting principles 
collection is reasonably assured as determined through an analysis of accounts receivable data  including historical product returns and the evaluation of each customer s ability to pay 
allowances for sales returns are based on the historical relationship between shipments and returns 
the company believes that its historical experience is an accurate reflection of future returns 
self insurance 
the company is self insured for certain costs related to employee medical coverage and workers compensation liability 
the company maintains stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit total exposure 
the company establishes a liability at the balance sheet date based on estimates for a variety of factors that influence the company s ultimate cost 
in the event that actual experience is substantially different from the estimates  the financial results for the period could be adversely affected 
the company believes that the methodologies used to estimate all factors related to employee medical coverage and workers compensation are an accurate reflection of the liability as of the date of the balance sheet 
pensions 
the company has two non contributory defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of the company s employees 
the company s board of directors approved the freezing of both defined benefit pension plans  effective as of april  as a result  the company re measured its pension liability  updating the pension measurement assumptions  and recorded pension curtailment charges of million during fiscal the estimated expense  benefits and pension obligation of these plans are determined using various assumptions 
the most significant assumptions are the long term expected rate of return on plan assets  the discount rate used to determine the present value of the pension obligations and the future rate of compensation level increases 
in fiscal  the company determined the discount rate by referencing the aon hewitt aa bond universe yield curve 
previously  the company referred to the hewitt above median yield curve in establishing the discount rate 
this change was caused by the merger of aon and hewitt and the corresponding elimination of the hewitt above median yield curve 
the company believes that using a yield curve approach accurately reflects changes in the present value of liabilities over time since each cash flow is discounted at the rate at which it could effectively be settled 
the long term expected rate of return on plan assets reflects the current mix of the plan assets invested in equities and bonds 
the following is a summary of the potential impact of a hypothetical change in actuarial assumptions for the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and consumer price index in millions impact of increase impact of decrease decrease increase effect on annual pension expense effect on projected pension benefit obligation pension expense for fiscal and the assumptions used in that calculation are presented in note h of the consolidated financial statements 
at april   the discount rate was compared to at april  the expected return on plan assets was at april   compared to at april  the assumed rate of increase in compensation levels was for the fiscal year ended april   unchanged from the prior fiscal year 
the projected performance of the company s pension plans is largely dependent on the assumptions used to measure the obligations of the plans and to estimate future performance of the plans invested assets 
over the past two measurement periods  the most material deviations between results based on assumptions and the actual plan performance have been as a result of the changes to the discount rate used to measure the plans benefit obligations and the actual return on plan assets 
accounting guidelines require the discount rate to be set to market at each annual measurement date 
from the fiscal to fiscal measurement dates  the discount rate decreased from to  and caused an actuarial loss of million that was recognized in fiscal from the fiscal to fiscal measurement dates  the discount rate decreased from at april  to at december  and at april   which caused an additional actuarial loss of million 
the company strives to balance expected long term returns and short term volatility of pension plan assets 
favorable and unfavorable differences between the assumed and actual returns on plan assets are generally amortized over a period no longer than the average life expectancy of the plans active participants 
the actual rates of return on plan assets realized  net of investment manager fees  were  and for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the fair value of plan assets at april  was million compared to million at april  the company s projected benefit obligation exceeded plan assets by million in fiscal and million in fiscal the million increase in the company s net under funded position during fiscal was driven by the company s million actuarial losses  plus additional service benefits accruing of million  offset in part by curtailments related to freezing the pension plans as of april   which stopped all future benefit accruals 
the company expects its pension expense to decrease from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  due to the elimination of future benefit accruals related to the freezing of the pension plans 
the company expects to contribute million to its pension plans in fiscal  which represents required funding 
the company made contributions of million to its pension plans in fiscal under the requirements of the pension protection act of  the company was not required to make contributions to its pension plans in fiscal promotional displays 
the company invests in promotional displays in retail stores to demonstrate product features  product specifications  quality specifications and serve as a training tool for designers 
the investment is carried at cost less applicable amortization 
amortization is provided by the straight line method on an individual display basis over the estimated period of economic benefit  approximately to months 
the company believes that the estimated period of economic benefit provides an accurate reflection of the value of displays as of the date of the balance sheet based on historical experience 
product warranty 
the company estimates outstanding warranty costs based on the historical relationship between warranty claims and revenues 
the warranty accrual is reviewed monthly to verify that it properly reflects the company s remaining obligation based on anticipated expenditures over the balance of the obligation period 
adjustments are made when actual warranty claim experience differs from estimates 
warranty claims are generally made within three months of the original shipment date 
stock based compensation expense 
the calculation of stock based compensation expense involves estimates that require management s judgment 
these estimates include the fair value of each stock option and restricted stock unit award granted 
stock option awards are estimated on the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model 
there are two significant inputs into the black scholes option pricing model expected volatility and expected term 
the company estimates expected volatility based on the historical volatility of the company s stock over a term equal to the expected term of the option granted 
the expected term of stock option awards granted is derived from historical exercise experience under the company s stock option plans and represents the period of time that stock option awards granted are expected to be outstanding 
for performance based restricted stock units  the company estimates the number of shares that will be granted upon satisfaction of the performance conditions  based upon actual and expected future operating results 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of significant management judgment 
as a result  if factors change or the company uses different assumptions  stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  the company is required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if the company s actual forfeiture rate is materially different from its estimate  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what the company has recorded in the current period 
see note g to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on stock based compensation 
valuation of deferred tax assets 
the company regularly considers the need for a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets 
based upon the company s analysis at april  and  the company determined in each case that a valuation allowance was not required 
the company considered all available evidence  both positive and negative  in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
as a result of the company s recent restructuring activities plus prospects for sales growth  management expects the company to return to profitability in fiscal based upon this analysis  management determined that it is more likely than not that the company s deferred tax assets will be realized through expected future income and the reversal of taxable temporary differences 
the company will continue to update this analysis on a periodic basis and changes in expectations about future income or the timing of the reversal of taxable temporary differences could cause the company to record a valuation allowance in a future period
