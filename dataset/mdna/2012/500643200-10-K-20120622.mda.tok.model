as of april   we had million of standby letters of credit issued under our facility 
critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements 
preparation of our periodic filings requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions and changes in the estimates are reported in current operations 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements and accounting for the underlying transactions and balances  we apply our accounting policies as disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we consider the policies discussed below as critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements 
table of contents because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment and estimates 
specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
senior management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition 
management is required to establish policies and procedures to ensure that revenue is recorded over the performance period for valid engagements and related costs are matched against such revenue 
we provide recruitment services on a retained basis and generally bill clients in three monthly installments commencing the month of client acceptance as this is the period over which the recruitment services are performed 
fees earned in excess of the initial contract amount are billed upon completion of the engagement  which reflect the difference between the final actual compensation of the placed executive and the estimate used for purposes of the previous billings 
since the fees are generally not contingent upon placement of a candidate  our assumptions primarily relate to establishing the period over which such service is performed 
these assumptions determine the timing of revenue recognition and profitability for the reported period 
if these assumptions do not accurately reflect the period over which revenue is earned  revenue and profit could differ 
any services that are provided on a contingent basis are recognized once the contingency is fulfilled 
futurestep provides recruitment process outsourcing services and fee revenue is recognized as services are rendered 
fee revenue from ltc is recognized as services are rendered for consulting engagements and other time based services  measured by total hours incurred to the total estimated hours at completion 
it is possible that updated estimates for the consulting engagement may vary from initial estimates 
if updated estimated total costs indicate a loss  we recognize that estimated loss in the period it is determined 
ltc revenue from licenses is recognized using a straight line method over the term of the contract generally months  which begins upon execution and is invoiced in the same month 
a portion of the revenue for ltc is derived from the sale of lominger products 
these products mainly consist of books covering a variety of topics including performance management  team effectiveness  and coaching and development 
the company recognizes revenue for their products when the product has been sold 
furthermore  a provision for doubtful accounts on recognized revenue is established with a charge to general and administrative expenses based on historical loss experience  assessment of the collectability of specific accounts  as well as expectations of future collections based upon trends and the type of work for which services are rendered 
annual performance related bonuses 
each quarter  management records its best estimate of its annual performance related compensation  which on a quarterly basis requires management to  among other things  project annual consultant employees who originate business productivity as measured by engagement fees billed and collected by executive search consultants or revenue for futurestep consultants  company performance including profitability  competitive forces and future economic conditions and their impact on our results 
at the end of each fiscal year  annual performance related bonuses take into account final individual consultant productivity  company results including profitability  the achievement of strategic objectives and the results of individual performance appraisals  as determined by management  and the current economic landscape 
activity based changes in any of the assumptions underlying the quarterly bonus accrual may significantly impact the compensation and benefits liability on our balance sheet and related compensation and benefits cost on our statement of income 
differences between the assumptions used each quarter to estimate annual performance related bonus and actual cash payments made on an annual basis could materially impact the carrying amount of the liability and our operating results 
deferred compensation 
estimating deferred compensation requires assumptions regarding the timing and probability of payments of benefits to participants and the discount rate 
changes in these assumptions would significantly impact the liability and related cost on our consolidated balance sheet and statement of income 
management engages an independent actuary to periodically review these assumptions in order to ensure that they reflect the population and economics of our deferred compensation plans in all material respects and to assist us in estimating our deferred compensation liability and the related cost 
the actuarial assumptions we use may differ from actual results due to changing market conditions or changes in the participant population 
these differences could have a significant impact on our deferred compensation liability and the related cost 
carrying values 
valuations are required under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap to determine the carrying value of various assets 
our most significant assets for which management is required 
table of contents to prepare valuations are goodwill  intangible assets  deferred income taxes and marketable securities 
management must identify whether events have occurred that may impact the carrying value of these assets and make assumptions regarding future events  such as cash flows and profitability 
differences between the assumptions used to prepare these valuations and actual results could materially impact the carrying amount of these assets and our operating results 
of the assets mentioned above  goodwill is the largest asset requiring a valuation 
fair value of goodwill for purposes of the goodwill impairment test is determined utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on forecast cash flows including estimated underlying revenue and operating income growth rates discounted using an estimated weighted average cost of capital for market participants 
a market approach  utilizing observable market data such as comparable companies in similar lines of business that are publicly traded or which are part of a public or private transaction to the extent available  is used to corroborate the discounted cash flow analysis performed at each reporting unit 
the company also reconciles the results of these analyses to its market capitalization 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  goodwill is considered potentially impaired and further tests are performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
we recorded no goodwill impairments in conjunction with our annual goodwill impairment assessment performed as of january  while historical performance and current expectations have resulted in fair values of goodwill in excess of carrying values  if our assumptions are not realized  it is possible that in the future an impairment charge may need to be recorded 
however  it is not possible at this time to determine if an impairment charge would result or if such a charge would be material 
fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors 
as a result  there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions of the future 
as of our testing date  none of the company s reporting units were considered at risk 
examples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the underlying key assumptions and ultimately impact the estimated fair value of the reporting units may include such items as follows a prolonged downturn in the business environment in which the reporting units operate especially in emea  an economic recovery that significantly differs from our assumptions in timing or degree  and volatility in equity and debt markets

the new guidance was effective for the company beginning february  the adoption of these amendments did not have an impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued amendments to the goodwill impairment testing guidance to allow an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether performing the current two step process is necessary 
under the new option  the calculation of the reporting unit s fair value is not required unless  as a result of the qualitative assessment  it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the unit s carrying amount 
this guidance was effective for the company beginning february  the company did not elect to apply this option in fiscal  but might change its election in the future 
if in the future the company elects to adopt this guidance  the adoption would not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a result of our global operating activities  we are exposed to certain market risks  including foreign currency exchange fluctuations and fluctuations in interest rates 
we manage our exposure to these risks in the normal course of our business as described below 
we have not utilized financial instruments for trading  hedging or other speculative purposes nor do we trade in derivative financial instruments 
foreign currency risk substantially all our foreign subsidiaries operations are measured in their local currencies 
assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars at the rates of exchange in effect at the end of each reporting period and revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange during the reporting period 
resulting trans 
table of contents lation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheets 
transactions denominated in a currency other than the reporting entity s functional currency may give rise to transaction gains and losses that impact our results of operations 
historically  we have not realized significant foreign currency gains or losses on such transactions 
during fiscal and  we recognized foreign currency losses  on an after tax basis  of million and million  respectively  as compared to fiscal in which we recognized foreign currency gains  on an after tax basis  of million 
our primary exposure to exchange losses or gains is based on outstanding intercompany loan balances denominated in us dollars 
if the us dollar strengthened or weakened by  and against the pound sterling  the euro  the canadian dollar  the australian dollar and the yen  our exchange gain or loss would have been million  million and million  respectively  based on outstanding balances at april  interest rate risk we primarily manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates through our regular financing activities  which generally are short term and provide for variable market rates 
as of april  and  we had no outstanding borrowings under our facility 
we had million and million of borrowings against the csv of coli contracts as of april  and  respectively  bearing interest primarily at variable rates 
the risk of fluctuations in these variable rates is minimized by the fact that we receive a corresponding adjustment to our borrowed funds crediting rate on the csv on our coli contracts
