item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is designed to provide a reader of american capital agency corp 
s consolidated financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of management 
our md a is presented in five sections executive overview financial condition results of operations liquidity and capital resources forward looking statements executive overview the size and composition of our investment portfolio depends on investment strategies implemented by our manager  the availability of investment capital and overall market conditions  including the availability of attractively priced investments and suitable financing to appropriately leverage our investment portfolio 
market conditions are influenced by  among other things  current levels of and expectations for future levels of  interest rates  mortgage prepayments  market liquidity  housing prices  unemployment rates  general economic conditions  government participation in the mortgage market  evolving regulations or legal settlements that impact servicing practices or other mortgage related activities 
trends and recent market impacts calendar year was marked by continued volatility and uncertainty 
the markets experienced the first ever us sovereign credit downgrade  the federal reserve s operation twist  enhancements to the home affordable refinance program harp  economic turmoil in europe  increasing geo political instability and numerous discussions around mass us government refinancing programs 
the effect was significant volatility in interest rates and prices of mortgage backed securities  ending with both mortgage and interest rates approaching historic low s and a still fragile housing market 
the us government in april  standard poor s revised its outlook on the long term rating of us sovereign credit to negative from stable  primarily due to very large budget deficits and rising government indebtedness as well as the uncertainty surrounding the resolution of these issues 
after lowering its outlook  standard poor s indicated that there was a chance that it could also lower its long term aaa rating of us sovereign credit unless us lawmakers addressed the budget deficits and rising government indebtedness 
on august   the us congress and the obama administration agreed to a fiscal plan that raised the nation s trillion debt ceiling and enforced only trillion in spending reductions over the next years 
in response  on august   standard poor s lowered their long term us sovereign credit rating one level to aa  stating that the downgrade reflects their opinion that the fiscal consolidation plan that the us congress and the obama administration agreed to falls short of what  in their view  would be necessary to stabilize the us government s medium term debt dynamics 
as we anticipated  the impact on agency securities was limited  with agency securities holding up reasonably well 
agency securities are first backed by a gse  then effectively by the us government and  with respect to agency mortgage backed securities  finally by largely performing mortgages 
on august   the federal open market committee issued a statement stating that market conditions warranted exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid in january  they issued a statement extending that expectation through in september  the federal reserve announced operation twist  a policy that involves the federal reserve selling billion in short term us treasury securities in exchange for buying the same amount of longer term us treasury bonds  starting in october and ending in june the policy was designed to lower yields on long term bonds  while keeping short term rates unchanged 
although largely anticipated prior to the federal reserve s announcement  the size of the program was larger than the market expected  resulting in the year us treasury rate immediately falling by basis points 
as part of operation twist  the federal reserve also announced that it will reinvest proceeds from its existing agency security positions back into agency securities 
mortgage spreads tightened temporarily by approximately basis points following the announcement 
the fhfa  fannie mae  and freddie mac subsequently announced enhancements to harp in november ll 
the reported goal of this refinance effort was to provide access to low cost refinancing for responsible homeowners suffering from falling home prices 
while the effects of the enhancements to harp remain unclear  we believe that they add significant prepayment risk to higher coupon mortgages guaranteed by the gses prior to june  which would otherwise be expected to have benign prepayments 
in advance of harp  we proactively sold our higher coupon seasoned agency securities and reduced our exposure to interest only securities as market valuations indicated a sense of complacency with respect to these risks 
importantly  our core positions of newer lower loan balance and existing harp securities remained outside of the scope of the recently announced harp changes 
it remains to be seen whether or not there will be further efforts by the us government to implement additional programs to encourage residential mortgage refinancing  but we plan to actively manage our investment portfolio so it will be well positioned against the dual challenges presented by organic and policy oriented prepayment risk 
interest rate volatility long term interest rates continued to fall during the year us treasury rate fell from as of the end of to by the end of we believe that the main drivers of the decline in long term rates to be continued weaker than expected economic data  market fears about sovereign debt in the eurozone and the federal reserve s current stance 
the following table presents one month libor  three month libor  year us treasury rate and the three year swap index as of the following dates date month libor month libor year treasury year swap index december  september  june  march  december  september  june  march  december  movements in interest rates impact the value of our securities and the amount of income we can generate from our portfolio of investments 
accordingly  one of the primary goals of our hedging activities is to protect our net asset value against significant fluctuations due to market risks  including interest rate and prepayment risk 
we utilize a variety of strategies to aid us in this objective 
the first chart below summarizes the year us treasury rate during the last three fiscal years with the corresponding prepayment environment 
by comparison  the second chart below summarizes our quarterly net asset value per share at the end of each of our quarterly fiscal periods during the last three fiscal years with the corresponding prepayment environment

prepayments market participants held different opinions regarding whether prepayments would remain benign despite historically low interest rates 
our manager believed the low level of interest rates  coupled with the significant amount of homeowners who have refinanced since  would lead to overall increases in prepayments and that the us government policy driven initiatives  such as harp  could actually cause very large prepayment differences between various types of agency securities 
consequently  throughout  we actively positioned our portfolio to better withstand prepayment risks  since we believe that lower prepayment speeds should allow us to generate greater returns on our agency mortgage backed security portfolio 
we invested in securities that have natural impediments to refinance activity  which we believe reduce our exposure to prepayments ie securities with lower loan balance collateral and securities that were already a product of harp 
as of december   of our year portfolio and of our year portfolio were backed by lower loan balance or harp securities 
the first chart below illustrates that prepayment speeds have increased significantly in for generic mortgage securities  exemplified by fannie mae  fixed rate  year tba securities 
in contrast  pools backed by lower loan balance mortgages and harp loans remained slow  exemplified by fannie mae  fixed rate  year moderate loan balance and harp securities 
similarly  prepayment speeds on our investment portfolio during remained well below those of the mortgage universe  illustrated in the second chart below

these financial statements are prepared in conformity with gaap 
in preparing the financial statements  management is required to make various judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on our financial statements 
the following is a summary of our policies most affected by management s judgments  estimates and assumptions 
interest income our recognition of interest income  in particular  involves estimates that require management to make judgments that are subjective in nature 
we accrue interest income based on the outstanding principal amount of our investment securities and their contractual terms and we amortize or accrete premiums and discounts associated with the purchase of investment securities into interest income over the projected lives of our securities  including contractual payments and estimated prepayments  using the interest method 
the weighted average cost basis of our securities as of december  was of par value  therefore  the effective yield on our agency securities is highly impacted by our estimate of future prepayments 
future prepayment rates are difficult to predict and we rely on our manager s experience and analysis of historical and current market data in order to arrive at what we believe to be reasonable estimates 
the most significant factor impacting prepayment rates on our securities is changes to long term interest rates 
prepayment rates generally increase when interest rates fall and decrease when interest rates rise 
however  there are a variety of other factors that may impact the rate of prepayments on our securities 
prepayments can also occur when borrowers sell the property and use the sale proceeds to prepay the mortgage as part of a physical relocation 
in addition  changes to the gse s underwriting standards  further modifications to existing us government sponsored programs such as harp  or the implementation of new programs can have a significant impact on the rate of prepayments 
further  gse buyouts of loans in imminent risk of default  loans that have been modified  or loans that have defaulted will generally be reflected as prepayments on agency securities and also increase the uncertainty around our estimates 
we estimate long term prepayment rates of our agency securities using a third party service and market data 
the third party service estimates prepayment rates using models that incorporate the forward yield curve  current mortgage rates  current mortgage rates of the outstanding loans  loan age  volatility and other factors 
we review the prepayment rate estimated by the third party service and compare the results to market consensus prepayment speeds  if available 
we also consider historical prepayment rates and current market conditions to validate the reasonableness of the prepayment rates estimated by the third party service and based on our manager s judgment we may make adjustments to their estimates 
actual and anticipated prepayment experience is reviewed quarterly and effective yields are recalculated when differences arise between the previously estimated future prepayments and the amounts actually received plus current anticipated future prepayments 
under different conditions  we could report materially different amounts 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in this annual report on form k includes the estimated change in our net interest income should interest rates go up or down by and basis points  assuming the yield curves of the rate shocks will be parallel to each other and the current yield curve 
fair value of investment securities we designate a security as held to maturity  available for sale or trading  depending on our ability and intent to hold such security to maturity 
securities classified as trading and available for sale are reported at fair value  while securities classified as held to maturity are reported at amortized cost 
we may  from time to time  sell any of our investment securities as part of our overall management of our investment portfolio 
accordingly  we typically designate our investment securities as available for sale 
all securities classified as available for sale are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses reported in other comprehensive income loss oci  a component of stockholders equity 
upon the sale of a security  we determine the cost of the security and the amount of unrealized gains or losses to reclassify out of accumulated oci into earnings based on the specific identification method 
we estimate the fair value of our investment securities based on a market approach using level inputs from third party pricing services and non binding dealer quotes 
the third party pricing services use pricing models that incorporate such factors as reported transactions  coupons  primary and secondary mortgage rates  prepayment speeds  spread to the treasury and interest rate swap curves  convexity  duration  periodic and life caps and credit enhancements 
the dealer quotes incorporate common market pricing methods  including observable transactions  spread measurement to the treasury or interest rate swap curve as well as underlying characteristics of the particular security including coupon  periodic and life caps  rate reset period  issuer  additional credit support and expected life of the security 
we generally obtain to quotes or prices referred to as marks per investment security 
the fair value of our investment securities as of december  is based on the median value of a weighted average of marks received per investment security 
we attempt to validate marks obtained from pricing services and broker dealers by comparing them to our recent completed transactions involving the same or similar securities on or near the reporting date 
we evaluate securities for other than temporary impairment otti on at least a quarterly basis  and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such evaluation 
the determination of whether a security is other than temporarily impaired involves judgments and assumptions based on subjective and objective factors 
when an investment security is impaired  an otti is considered to have occurred if i we intend to sell the investment security ie a decision has been made as the reporting date or ii it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the investment security before recovery of its amortized cost basis 
if we intend to sell the security or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the investment security before recovery of its amortized cost basis  the entire amount of the impairment loss  if any  is recognized in earnings as a realized loss and the cost basis of the security is adjusted to its fair value 
we did not recognize any otti charges on any of our investment securities for fiscal years  and 
derivative financial instruments hedging activity prior to the third quarter of  we entered into interest rate swap agreements typically with the intention of qualifying for hedge accounting 
however  as of september   we elected to discontinue hedge accounting for our interest rate swaps in order to increase our funding flexibility 
for our interest rate swaps to qualify as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes  their monthly reset dates were required to align with the term of an underlying repurchase agreement 
this alignment had the effect of limiting our ability to alter or extend the maturity of our repurchase agreements 
to provide greater funding flexibility  we determined that it was not beneficial to always match the pricing dates of our swaps and repurchase agreements and  thus  elected to discontinue hedge accounting 
our net asset value was not impacted by our election to discontinue hedge accounting since our net asset value is the same irrespective of whether we apply hedge accounting 
since we continue to hold repurchase agreements in excess of our interest rate swap contracts and have no indication that interest payments on the hedged repurchase agreements are in jeopardy of discontinuing  upon discontinuation of hedge accounting  the net deferred loss related to our de designated interest rate swaps remained in accumulated oci 
following hedge de designation  on september   the net deferred loss is being reclassified from accumulated oci into interest expense on a straight line basis over the remaining term of each interest rate swap 
however  although the reclassification of accumulated oci into interest expense is similar to as if the interest rate swaps had not been de designated  the actual net periodic interest costs associated with our de designated interest rates swaps may be more or less than amounts reclassified into interest expense 
the difference  as well as net periodic interest costs on interest rate swaps that were never in a hedge designation  along with subsequent changes in the fair value of our interest rates swaps  is reported in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income in gain loss on derivative instruments and other securities  net 
cash flows from interest rate swaps subsequent to our discontinuance of hedge accounting are classified in investing activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows 
we estimate the fair value of interest rate swaps based on inputs from a third party pricing model 
the third party pricing model incorporates such factors as the treasury curve  libor rates  and the pay rate on the interest rate swaps 
we also incorporate both our own and our counterparties nonperformance risk in estimating the fair value of our interest rate swap and swaption agreements 
in considering the effect of nonperformance risk  we consider the impact of netting and credit enhancements  such as collateral postings and guarantees  and have concluded that our own and our counterparty risk is not significant to the overall valuation of these agreements

as of december   the combined weighted average yield of our agency mbs portfolio was 
the actual maturities of agency mbs are generally shorter than stated contractual maturities primarily as a result of prepayments of principal of the underlying mortgages 
the stated contractual final maturity of the mortgage loans underlying our agency mbs portfolio ranges up to years  but the expected maturity is subject to change based on the actual and expected future prepayments of the underlying loans 
as of december  and  the weighted average final contractual maturity of our agency mbs portfolio was and years  respectively 
the weighted average expected maturity of our agency mbs portfolio was and years as of december  and  respectively 
in determining the estimated weighted average years to maturity of our agency mbs and the yield on our agency mbs  we have assumed a constant prepayment rate cpr over the remaining projected life of our agency mbs portfolio of as of december  we amortize or accrete premiums and discounts associated with purchases of our agency mbs into interest income over the estimated life of our securities based on actual and projected cprs  using the effective yield method

fiscal year fiscal year amount yield amount yield cash interest income premium amortization interest income actual portfolio cpr projected life cpr as of period end interest income increased to billion due to a increase in our average investment portfolio  partially offset by a basis point bps decline in our weighted average asset yield 
the decline in our weighted average asset yield was due to the decline in long term interest rates during and the result of acquiring lower yielding securities with the increase and re composition of our portfolio during the year 
although  our assets benefited from lower actual prepayments during of cpr  they were negatively impacted by a bps increase in our projected life cpr of as of december   as a result of the decline in interest rates

when adjusted for the net payable for unsettled agency securities  our leverage ratio was and times our stockholders equity as of december  and  respectively 
our actual leverage will vary from time to time based on various factors  including our manager s opinion of the level of risk of our assets and liabilities  our liquidity position  our level of unused borrowing capacity  over collateralization levels required by lenders when we pledge agency securities to secure our borrowings and the current market value of our investment portfolio 
in addition  certain of our master repurchase agreements and master swap agreements contain a restriction that prohibits our leverage as defined pursuant to each agreement from exceeding levels ranging from to times the amount of our stockholders equity 
additionally  under certain of our agreements  we could be required to settle our obligations under the agreements if we fail to maintain minimum shareholders equity thresholds or our reit status

average leverage for the quarters ended march  and june  was x and x  pro forma  when average equity is adjusted to exclude the march and june follow on equity offering that closed on march  and june   respectively 
average leverage for the period was higher than leverage as of period end because we had not fully invested net proceeds raised from follow on equity offerings occurring late in the period 
economic interest expense and cost of funds prior to the third quarter of  we entered into interest rate swap agreements typically with the intention of qualifying for hedge accounting under gaap 
however  as of september   we elected to discontinue hedge accounting for our interest rate swaps in order to increase our funding flexibility refer to note of our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k regarding our discontinuance of hedge accounting 
subsequent to our discontinuance of hedge accounting  the net deferred loss related to our de designated interest rate swaps is being reclassified from accumulated oci into interest expense on a straight line basis over the remaining term of each interest rate swap 
although the reclassification of accumulated oci into interest expense is similar to as if the interest rate swaps had not been de designated  the actual net periodic interest costs associated with our de designated interest rates swaps was greater than the amounts reclassified into interest expense for the period subsequent to discontinuation of hedge accounting through december  the difference  as well as net periodic interest costs on interest rate swaps that were never in a hedge designation  is reported in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income in gain loss on derivative instruments and other securities  net

our average interest rate swaps outstanding in the table above exclude our forward starting swaps not in effect during the periods presented 
forward starting swaps do not impact our economic interest expense and cost of funds until they commence accruing net interest settlements on their forward start dates 
we enter into forward starting interest rate swaps based on a variety of factors  including our manager s view of the forward yield curve and the timing of potential changes in short term interest rates  time to deploy new capital  amount and timing of expirations of our existing interest swap portfolio and current and anticipated swap spreads 
as of december   we had billion of forward starting swaps outstanding with forward start dates through may  gross of billion of swaps set to expire through december as of december   we had billion of forward starting swaps outstanding with forward start dates through june  gross of billion of swaps set to expire through december the increase in our economic interest expense was attributed to an increase in our average repurchase agreements outstanding driven by the increase in our investment portfolio 
the larger repurchase agreement balance was partially offset by an bps decline in our total cost of funds 
the decline was primarily due to the amortization of termination fees recognized during fiscal year on interest rate swaps terminated in a prior period  which were fully amortized prior to the weighted average interest rate on our repurchase agreements was largely unchanged year over year 
our ratio of interest rate swaps outstanding to repurchase agreements increased during the year  the impact of which was offset by a decrease in the weighted average pay rate on our interest rate swaps

the increase in the amount of agency mbs sold was due to an increase in the overall size of our investment portfolio  as well as our manager s execution of our active portfolio management strategy 
our strategy for the periods presented was largely focused on repositioning our agency mbs portfolio towards securities with attributes our manager believes reduce the level of prepayment risk in light of current and anticipated interest rates  federal government programs  general economic conditions and other factors and  in our manager s opinion  provide more attractive risk adjusted returns

our increased use of derivative instruments and other securities during is correlated to the overall increase in our investment portfolio and continued interest rate volatility experienced during for further details regarding our use of derivative instruments and related activity for fiscal years and refer to notes and of our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
management fees and general and administrative expenses we pay our manager a base management fee payable monthly in arrears in amount equal to one twelfth of of our equity 
our equity is defined as our month end stockholders equity  adjusted to exclude the effect of any unrealized gains or losses included in either retained earnings or oci  each as computed in accordance with gaap 
there is no incentive compensation payable to our manager pursuant to the management agreement 
we incurred management fees of million and million during fiscal years and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses were million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
our general and administrative expenses primarily consisted of prime broker fees  information technology costs  the allocation of overhead expenses from our manager  accounting fees  legal fees  board of director fees and insurance expenses 
our total expenses as a percentage of our average stockholders equity declined to for fiscal year compared to for fiscal year due to improved operating leverage 
dividends and income taxes for fiscal years and  we declared dividends of per share 
as a reit  we are required to distribute annually of our taxable income to maintain our status as a reit and all of our taxable income to avoid federal and state corporate income taxes 
we can treat dividends declared by september and paid by december as having been a distribution of our taxable income for our prior tax year 
income as determined under gaap differs from income as determined under tax rules because of both temporary and permanent differences in income and expense recognition 
the primary differences are i unrealized gains and losses associated with interest rate swaps and other derivatives and securities marked to market in current income for gaap purposes  but excluded from taxable income until realized or settled  ii temporary differences related to the amortization of premiums paid on investments  iii timing differences in the recognition of certain realized gains and losses and iv permanent differences for excise tax expense 
as of december   we have distributed all of our taxable income for the tax year and we have an estimated million of undistributed taxable income related to our tax year  net of our december  dividend payable of million 
we expect to distribute our remaining fiscal year taxable income during fiscal year so that we will not be subject to federal or state corporate income tax 
however  as a reit  we are still subject to a nondeductible federal excise tax of to the extent that the sum of i of our ordinary taxable income  ii of our capital gains and iii any undistributed taxable income from the prior year exceeds our distributions paid in such year 
for fiscal years and  we accrued a federal excise tax of million and million  respectively  included in our provision for income taxes on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income because our calendar year distributions were less than the total of these amounts 
further  our trs is subject to corporate federal and state income taxes 
for fiscal year  we recorded an income tax provision attributable to our trs of million  which is included in our provision for income taxes on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income 
for the fiscal year  we had no activity in our trs 
net income and comprehensive income for fiscal year  we recorded comprehensive income of billion  or per share  comprised of net income of million  or per share  and other comprehensive income of million  or per share 
our fiscal year other comprehensive income was comprised of billion of net unrealized gains on agency mbs and million of net unrealized losses on interest rate swaps 
for fiscal year  we recorded comprehensive income of million  or per share  comprised of net income of million  or per share  and other comprehensive loss of million  or per share 
our fiscal year other comprehensive loss was comprised of million net unrealized losses on agency mbs and million of net unrealized losses on interest rate swaps 
the increase in other comprehensive income was primarily due to the basis point decline in the year us treasury rate during fiscal year compared to a basis point decline during fiscal year during fiscal year  the year us treasury rate declined from to  whereas the year us treasury rate declined from to during fiscal year generic agency mbs appreciated in price during as a result of the decline in long term rates 
specified agency mbs with natural impediments to refinancing  such as investments in securities backed by loans issued through harp and lower loan balance pools  or approximately of our investment portfolio as of december   outperformed the price performance of generic agency mbs due to increased market concerns surrounding prepayments 
appreciation of our agency mbs portfolio was partially offset by losses on our interest rate swaps due to the general flattening of the yield curve and decline in interest rates 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year interest income and asset yield interest income increased to million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year this was due to a increase in our average investment portfolio  partially offset by a decline in our average asset yield from fiscal year our average asset yield declined to for fiscal year from for fiscal year as a result of acquiring lower yielding agency mbs securities due to changes in our portfolio composition 
the average coupon of our agency mbs portfolio declined to for fiscal year from for fiscal year the average amortized cost basis of our agency mbs portfolio increased to for fiscal year from for the prior year 
the effective yield or asset yield on our agency mbs is based on actual cprs realized for individual securities in our investment portfolio through the reporting date and assumes a cpr over the remaining projected life of our aggregate investment portfolio of and as of december  and  respectively 
the actual cpr realized for individual agency mbs in our investment portfolio was approximately and for fiscal years and  respectively 
interest income for fiscal years and is net of million and million  respectively  for net amortization of premiums and discounts on our agency mbs portfolio 
the unamortized premium balance  net of discounts  of our aggregate agency mbs portfolio was million including the unamortized cost basis of our interest only strips and million as of december  and  respectively

leverage as of period end was calculated by dividing the amount outstanding under our repurchase agreements and other debt by our stockholders equity at period end 
leverage as of period end  net of unsettled trades was calculated by dividing the sum of the amount outstanding under our repurchase agreements  net liabilities and receivables for unsettled agency securities and other debt by our total stockholders equity at period end 
average leverage for the period was higher than leverage as of period end because we had not fully invested net proceeds raised from follow on equity offerings occurring late in the period 
interest expense and cost of funds interest expense was million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase in interest expense was due to an increase in our average repurchase agreements and other debt outstanding  partially offset by a decline our total cost of funds as described below 
for fiscal years and  average repurchase agreements and other debt outstanding were billion and billion  respectively 
the increase in the average repurchase agreement and other debt balance over fiscal year was primarily driven by deploying new equity capital raised during the periods on a levered basis 
the average interest rate on our repurchase agreements and other debt declined to for fiscal year from for the prior year  primarily driven by the decline in the one month libor interest rate 
including the net impact of interest rate swaps  the total average cost of funds for fiscal years and declined to from  respectively or to from when excluding amortization expense associated with previously terminated interest rate swaps 
as of december  and  we had outstanding interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges under asc for a total notional amount of billion and billion  respectively 
outstanding designated interest rate swaps were and of the outstanding balance under our repurchase agreements and other debt as of december  and  respectively 
for fiscal years and  our designated interest rate swaps increased the cost of our borrowings by million and million or million and million excluding amortization expense associated with the termination of interest rate swaps  respectively  which equaled and or and excluding terminated swap amortization expense of interest bearing liabilities  respectively 
we did not terminate any interest rate swaps accounted for as hedges under asc during fiscal year during fiscal year  we terminated interest rate swaps with notional amounts of million  resulting in net settlement payments of million  equal to their fair value on the date of termination 
the net settlements were amortized into income over the remaining life of the terminated interest rate swaps through the second quarter of and included in interest expense on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income 
amortization expense for the terminated swaps was million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
gain on sale of agency securities  net the following table is a summary of our net gain on sale of agency mbs securities for the current and prior year periods in thousands fiscal year agency mbs sold  at cost proceeds from agency mbs sold net gains on sale of agency mbs gross gains on sale of agency mbs gross losses on sale of agency mbs net gains on sale of agency mbs proceeds include cash received during the period  plus receivable for agency mbs sold during the period as of period end 
the increase in the amount of agency mbs sold during fiscal year compared to fiscal year was due to an increase in the size of our investment portfolio  as well as our manager s execution of our active portfolio management strategy 
our strategy for the periods presented was largely focused on repositioning our portfolio towards securities with attributes our manager believes reduce the level of prepayment risk in light of current and anticipated interest rates  federal government programs  general economic conditions and other factors 
gain loss on derivative instruments and other securities  net the following table is a summary of our gain loss on derivative instruments and other securities  net for years ended december  and in thousands fiscal year other realized gain loss on derivative instruments and other securities tbas and forward settling agency securities interest rate payer swaptions interest rate swaps not designated as hedges us treasury securities short sales of us treasury securities hedge ineffectiveness related to missed forecasts on interest rate swaps designated as hedges put options total other realized gain loss on derivative instruments and other securities  net unrealized gain on derivative instruments and other securities tbas and forward settling agency securities interest only and principal only strips interest rate payer swaptions interest rate swaps not designated as hedges short sales of us treasury securities hedge ineffectiveness on interest rate swaps total unrealized gain on derivative instruments and other securities  net total gain loss on derivative instruments and other securities  net unrealized gain from derivatives and other securities includes reversals of prior period amounts for settled or expired derivatives and other securities 
the increase in the net gains from derivatives and other securities for fiscal year over fiscal year is due to an increase in the size our investment portfolio coupled with an increase in the use of other supplemental hedging strategies entered into to manage the potential adverse impact of short term changes in interest rates on the value of our investments and our cash flows 
net gains from derivatives and other securities for fiscal year benefited particularly during the fourth quarter of  which  given the increase in interest rates we experienced during december of  resulted in a significant amount of net gains from our use of other supplemental hedging strategies 
further details regarding our derivatives and related hedging activity for the years ended december  and are discussed in notes and to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
management fees and general and administrative expenses we incurred management fees of million and million during fiscal years and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses were million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
our general and administrative expenses primarily consisted of prime broker fees  information technology costs  the allocation of overhead expenses from our manager  accounting fees  legal fees  board of director fees and insurance expenses 
our total expenses as a percentage of our average stockholders equity declined to for fiscal year compared to for fiscal year due to improved operating leverage 
income taxes as a reit  we are subject to a nondeductible federal excise tax of to the extent that the sum of i of our ordinary taxable income  ii of our capital gains and iii any undistributed taxable income from the prior year exceeds our distributions paid in such year 
for fiscal years and  we accrued a federal excise tax of million and million  respectively  because our calendar year distributions were less than the total of these amounts 
however  we did distribute all of our taxable income for fiscal year and expect to distribute all our remaining taxable income for fiscal year to our stockholders as required for a reit so that we would not be subject to any federal income tax 
net income and net return on equity net income was million  or per basic and diluted share  and million  or per basic and diluted share  for fiscal years and  respectively 
for fiscal year  the net return on average equity was  or excluding other income  net and excise tax compared to net return on average equity of  or excluding other income  net and excise tax for fiscal year dividends for fiscal years and  we declared dividends of per share and per share  respectively 
as of december   we have distributed all of our taxable income for the tax year and we had million of undistributed taxable income related to our tax year  net of the december  dividend payable of million 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of funds are borrowings under master repurchase agreements  equity offerings  asset sales and monthly principal and interest payments on our investment portfolio 
because the level of our borrowings can be adjusted on a daily basis  the level of cash and cash equivalents carried on the balance sheet is significantly less important than the potential liquidity available under our borrowing arrangements 
we currently believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources available for the acquisition of additional investments  repayments on borrowings  maintenance of any margin requirements and the payment of cash dividends as required for our continued qualification as a reit 
to qualify as a reit  we must distribute annually at least of our taxable income 
to the extent that we annually distribute all of our taxable income in a timely manner  we will generally not be subject to federal and state income taxes 
we currently expect to distribute all of our taxable income in a timely manner so that we are not subject to federal and state income taxes 
this distribution requirement limits our ability to retain earnings and thereby replenish or increase capital from operations 
equity capital raising activities to the extent we raise additional equity capital through follow on equity offerings  through our at the market offering program or under our dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan  we currently anticipate using cash proceeds from such transactions to purchase additional investment securities  to make scheduled payments of principal and interest on our repurchase agreements and for other general corporate purposes 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be able to raise additional equity capital at any particular time or on any particular terms 
equity offerings during fiscal year december   we completed four follow on public offerings of shares of our common stock summarized in the table below in thousands  except per share amounts public offering price received per share shares net proceeds january march june november total price received per share is gross of underwriters discount  if applicable 
net proceeds are net of the underwriters discount  if applicable  and other offering costs 
shares of our common stock were sold to underwriters  who sold the shares in one or more transactions on the nasdaq global select market  in the over the counter market  through negotiated transactions or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale 
at the market offering program during fiscal years and  we entered into sales agreements with underwriters to publicly offer and sell shares of our common stock in privately negotiated and or at the market transactions from time to time 
during fiscal year  we sold million shares of our common stock under a sales agreement at an average offering price of per share for proceeds  net of the underwriter s discount and other program costs  of million 
during fiscal year  we sold million shares of our common stock under a sales agreement at an average offering price of per share for proceeds  net of the underwriter s discount and other program costs  of million 
as of december   million shares of our common stock remain available for issuance under the sales agreements 
dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan we sponsor a dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan through which stockholders may purchase additional shares of our common stock by reinvesting some or all of the cash dividends received on shares of our common stock 
stockholders may also make optional cash purchases of shares of our common stock subject to certain limitations detailed in the plan prospectus 
during fiscal years and  we issued million and million shares under the plan for net cash proceeds of million and million  respectively 
we did not issue any shares under the plan for the fiscal year as of december   million shares of our common stock remain available for issuance under the plan 
debt capital as part of our investment strategy  we borrow against our investment portfolio pursuant to master repurchase agreements 
we expect that our borrowings under such master repurchase agreements will generally have maturities ranging up to one year 
our leverage may vary periodically depending on market conditions and our manager s assessment of risk and returns 
we generally would expect our leverage to be within six to eleven times the amount of our stockholders equity 
however  under certain market conditions  we may operate at leverage levels outside of this range for extended periods of time 
our leverage ratio was times the amount of our stockholders equity as of december   including our total borrowings and net payables receivables for agency securities not yet settled 
our cost of borrowings under master repurchase agreements generally corresponds to libor plus or minus a margin 
as of september   we elected to discontinue accounting for our interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges under gaap in order to allow us greater flexibility in setting the maturity of our repurchase agreements and  thereby  enabling us to opportunistically extend the terms of our repurchase agreements and reduce the roll risk associated with maturing repurchase agreements 
please refer to notes and to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k for further details regarding our discontinuation of hedge accounting 
to limit our exposure to counterparty credit risk  we diversify our funding across multiple counterparties and by counterparty region 
as of december   we had master repurchase agreements with financial institutions  subject to certain conditions  located throughout north america  europe and asia 
as of december   less than of our stockholders equity was at risk with any one repo counterparty  with the top five repo counterparties representing less than of our stockholders equity 
the table below includes a summary of our repurchase agreement funding by number of repo counterparties and counterparty region as of december  for further details regarding our borrowings under repurchase agreements and other debt as of december   please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
as of december  counter party region number of counter parties percent of repurchase agreement funding north america europe asia table above excludes two repurchase agreement counterparties located in north america and europe with whom we did not have outstanding repurchase agreement borrowings with as of december  amounts available to be borrowed under our repurchase agreements are dependent upon lender collateral requirements and the lender s determination of the fair value of the securities pledged as collateral  which fluctuates with changes in interest rates  credit quality and liquidity conditions within the investment banking  mortgage finance and real estate industries 
in addition  our counterparties apply a haircut to our pledged collateral  which means our collateral is valued at slightly less than market value 
this haircut reflects the underlying risk of the specific collateral and protects our counterparty against a change in its value  but conversely subjects us to counterparty risk and limits the amount we can borrow against our investment securities 
our master repurchase agreements do not specify the haircut  rather haircuts are determined on an individual repurchase transaction basis 
throughout fiscal year  haircuts on our pledged collateral remained stable and as of december   our weighted average haircut was less than of the value of our collateral 
under our repurchase agreements  we may be required to pledge additional assets to the repurchase agreement counterparties in the event the estimated fair value of the existing pledged collateral under such agreements declines and such counterparties demand additional collateral a margin call  which may take the form of additional securities or cash 
similarly  if the estimated fair value of investment securities increases due to changes in the market interest rates  counterparties may release collateral back to us 
specifically  margin calls would result from a decline in the value of our agency securities securing our repurchase agreements and prepayments on the mortgages securing such agency securities 
our counterparties monitor the estimated value of our collateral based on recognized pricing sources and recent transactions involving similar collateral 
as of december   we have met all of our margin requirements 
we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of billion and unpledged agency securities of billion  after deducting the net payable for unsettled agency securities  available to meet margin calls on our repurchase agreements and derivative instruments as of december  although we believe we will have adequate sources of liquidity available to us through repurchase agreement financing to execute our business strategy  there can be no assurances that repurchase agreement financing will be available to us upon the maturity of our current repurchase agreements to allow us to renew or replace our repurchase agreement financing on favorable terms or at all 
if our repurchase agreement lenders default on their obligations to resell the underlying agency securities back to us at the end of the term  we could incur a loss equal to the difference between the value of the agency securities and the cash we originally received 
we maintain an interest rate risk management strategy under which we use derivative financial instruments to manage the adverse impact of interest rate changes on the value of our investment portfolio as well as our cash flows 
in particular  we attempt to mitigate the risk of the cost of our short term variable rate liabilities increasing at a faster rate than the earnings of our long term assets during a period of rising interest rates 
the principal derivative instruments that we use are interest rate swaps  supplemented with the use of interest rate swaptions  tba securities  options  futures and other instruments 
we use interest rate swap agreements to effectively lock in fixed rates on a portion of our short term borrowings because longer term committed borrowings are not available at attractive terms 
as of december   we had no interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes 
please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k for further details regarding our outstanding interest rate swaps as of december  and related activity for fiscal year off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not maintain any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance  or special purpose or variable interest entities  established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
further  as of december   we had not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities or entered into any commitment or intent to provide funding to any such entities

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes market factors such as in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the primary market risks that we are exposed to are interest rate risk  prepayment risk  spread risk  liquidity risk  extension risk and inflation risk 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control 
changes in the general level of interest rates can affect our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred in connection with our interest bearing liabilities  by affecting the spread between our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
changes in the general level of interest rates can also affect our periodic settlements of interest rate swaps and the value of our interest rate swaps which impact our net income 
changes in the level of interest rates can also affect the rate of prepayments of our securities and the value of the agency securities that constitute our investment portfolio  which affects our net income and ability to realize gains from the sale of these assets and impacts our ability and the amount that we can borrow against these securities 
we may utilize a variety of financial instruments in order to limit the effects of changes in interest rates on our operations  including interest rate swap agreements  interest rate swaptions  interest rate cap or floor contracts and futures or forward contracts 
we may also purchase or short tba securities  us treasury securities and us treasury futures contracts  purchase or write put or call options on tba securities or we may invest in other types of mortgage derivative securities  such as interest only securities  and synthetic total return swaps  such as the markit ios index 
when we use these types of derivatives to hedge the risk of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities  we may be subject to certain risks  including the risk that losses on a hedge position will reduce the funds available for payments to holders of our common stock and that the losses may exceed the amount we invested in the instruments 
our profitability and the value of our investment portfolio including derivatives used for economic hedging purposes may be adversely affected during any period as a result of changing interest rates including changes in the forward yield curve 
the following table quantifies the estimated changes in net interest income including periodic interest costs on our interest rate swaps and the fair value of our investment portfolio value including derivatives used for economic hedging purposes should interest rates go up or down by and basis points  assuming the yield curves of the rate shocks will be parallel to each other and the current yield curve 
these estimates were compiled using a combination of third party services  market data and internal models 
all changes in income and value are measured as percentage changes from the projected net interest income and investment portfolio value at the base interest rate scenario 
the base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates as of december  given the low level of interest rates  we also apply a floor of for all anticipated interest rates included in our assumptions  such that any hypothetical interest rate decrease would have a limited positive impact on our funding costs beyond a certain level 
however  because estimated prepayment speeds are impacted to a lessor degree by this floor  it is expected that an increase in our prepayment speeds as a result of a hypothetical interest rate decrease would result in an acceleration of our premium amortization and could result in reinvestment of such prepaid principal into lower yielding assets 
actual results could differ materially from estimates  especially in the current market environment 
the accuracy of the projected agency securities prices relies on assumptions that define specific agency securities spreads and varying prepayment assumptions at projected interest rate levels 
to the extent that these estimates or other assumptions do not hold true  which is likely in a period of high price volatility  actual results will likely differ materially from projections and could be larger or smaller than the estimates in the table below 
moreover  if different models were employed in the analysis  materially different projections could result 
in addition  the table below also does not include the impact of leverage  which generally has the effect of increasing the impact of the percentage change in projected portfolio value on stockholders equity by a factor of leverage plus one 
lastly  while the tables below reflect the estimated impact of interest rate increases and decreases on a static portfolio  we may from time to time sell any of our agency securities as a part of our overall management of our investment portfolio 
change in interest rate percentage change in projected net interest income percentage change in projected portfolio value  with effect of derivatives basis points basis points basis points basis points includes the effect of periodic interest costs on our interest rate swaps 
prepayment risk premiums and discounts associated with the purchase of agency mbs are amortized or accreted into interest income over the projected lives of the securities  including contractual payments and estimated prepayments using the interest method 
changes to the gse s underwriting standards  further modifications to existing us government sponsored programs such as harp  or the implementation of new programs could materially impact prepayment speeds 
in addition  gse buyouts of loans in imminent risk of default  loans that have been modified  or loans that have defaulted will generally be reflected as prepayments on agency securities and also increase the uncertainty around these estimates 
our policy for estimating prepayment speeds for calculating the effective yield is to evaluate published prepayment data for similar agency securities  market consensus and current market conditions 
if the actual prepayment experienced differs from our estimate of prepayments  we will be required to make an adjustment to the amortization or accretion of premiums and discounts that would have an impact on future income 
spread risk our available for sale securities are reflected at their estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in oci 
as of december   the fair value of these securities was billion 
when the market spread between the yield on our agency securities and us treasury securities or swap rates widens  the value of our agency securities and or our net book value could decline  creating what we refer to as spread risk 
the spread risk associated with our agency securities and the resulting fluctuations in fair value of these securities can occur independent of interest rates and may relate to other factors impacting the mortgage and fixed income markets such as liquidity or changes in required rates of return on different assets 
liquidity risk the primary liquidity risk for us arises from financing long term assets with shorter term borrowings through repurchase agreements 
our assets that are pledged to secure repurchase agreements are agency securities and cash 
as of december   we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of billion and unpledged agency securities of billion available to meet margin calls on our repurchase agreements  derivative instruments and for other corporate purposes 
however  should the value of our agency securities pledged as collateral suddenly decrease  margin calls relating to our repurchase agreements could increase  causing an adverse change in our liquidity position 
as such  there is no assurance that we will always be able to renew or roll our repurchase agreements 
in addition  our counterparties have the option to increase our haircuts margin requirements on the assets we pledge against repurchase agreements  thereby reducing the amount that can be borrowed against an asset even if they agree to renew or roll the repurchase agreement 
significantly higher haircuts can reduce our ability to leverage our portfolio or even force us to sell assets  especially if correlated with asset price declines or faster prepayment rates on our assets 
extension risk the projected weighted average life and the duration or interest rate sensitivity of our investments is based on our manager s assumptions regarding the rate at which the borrowers will prepay the underlying mortgage loans 
in general  we use interest rate swaps and swaptions to help manage our funding cost on our investments in the event that interest rates rise 
these swaps or swaptions allow us to reduce our funding exposure on the notional amount of the swap for a specified period of time by establishing a fixed rate to pay in exchange for receiving a floating rate that generally tracks our financing costs under our repurchase agreements 
however  if prepayment rates decrease in a rising interest rate environment  the average life or duration of our fixed rate assets or the fixed rate portion of the arms or other assets generally extends 
this could have a negative impact on our results from operations  as our interest rate swap maturities are fixed and will  therefore  cover a smaller percentage of our funding exposure on our mortgage assets to the extent that their average lives increase due to slower prepayments 
this situation may also cause the market value of our agency securities collateralized by fixed rate mortgages or hybrid arms to decline by more than otherwise would be the case while most of our hedging instruments with the exception of short tba mortgage positions  interest only securities  markit ios index total return swaps and certain other supplemental hedging instruments would not receive any incremental offsetting gains 
in extreme situations  we may be forced to sell assets to maintain adequate liquidity  which could cause us to incur realized losses 
inflation risk virtually all of our assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive in nature 
as a result  interest rates and other factors influence our performance more so than does inflation 
changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates 
further  our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap and our distributions are determined by our board of directors based primarily by our net income as calculated for income tax purposes 
in each case  our activities and balance sheet are measured with reference to historical cost and or fair market value without considering inflation
