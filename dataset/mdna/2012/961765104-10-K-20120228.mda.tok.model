risk factors 
general we manage investment assets and provide services for our clients through two subsidiaries  westwood management corp 
westwood management and westwood trust 
westwood management provides investment advisory services to corporate retirement plans  public retirement plans  endowments and foundations  a family of mutual funds called the westwood funds tm  other mutual funds  individuals and clients of westwood trust 
we changed the name of our mutual fund family in early from the whg funds to the westwood funds tm as part of an effort to consolidate our branding strategies under the westwood name  which has significant meaning to our firm and we believe will better resonate with our clients 
westwood trust provides trust and custodial services and participation in self sponsored common trust funds to institutions and high net worth individuals 
our revenues are generally derived from fees based on a percentage of assets under management and westwood management and westwood trust collectively managed assets valued at approximately billion at december  we have been providing investment advisory services since and  according to recognized industry sources such as morningstar  performance of our principal investment strategies rank at or above median within their peer groups when measured over multi year periods of ten years and longer 
the core of our business is dependent on client relationships 
we believe that  in addition to investment performance  client service is paramount in the asset management business 
accordingly  a major focus of our business strategy is to build strong relationships with clients to enhance our ability to anticipate their needs and satisfy their investment objectives 
our team approach is designed to deliver efficient  responsive service to our clients 
our success is dependent to a significant degree on investment performance and our ability to provide attentive client service 
we were incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware on december  we are an independent public company and our common stock is listed on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol whg 
we are a holding company whose principal assets consist of the capital stock of westwood management and westwood trust 
one of several priorities on which we have focused since is the building of a foundation in terms of personnel and infrastructure to support a much larger business 
we have also developed products that we expect to be desirable within our target institutional  private wealth and mutual fund markets 
the costs of developing new products and building the organization can result in incurring expenses before significant offsetting revenues are realized 
we believe that the business foundation and a range of appropriate products are now in place and we have been taking these products in recent years to our served markets where they have been received with a high level of interest which generate new revenue streams

westwood management general westwood management provides investment advisory services to large institutions  including corporate retirement plans  public retirement plans  endowments and foundations 
institutional separate account minimums depend on the strategy offered but generally range from million to million 
westwood management also provides advisory services to individuals and the westwood funds tm and subadvisory services to other mutual funds 
our overall investment philosophy was developed by our founder and chairman  susan m 
byrne  and is implemented by a team of investment professionals under the leadership of our chief investment officer  mark freeman 
with respect to the bulk of assets under management we utilize a value investment style focused on achieving a superior long term  risk adjusted return by investing in companies with high levels of free cash flow  improving returns on equity  strengthening balance sheets and well positioned for growth but whose value is not fully recognized in the marketplace 
this investment approach is designed to preserve capital during unfavorable periods and provide superior real returns over the long term 
our investment team members average investment experience of fifteen years and one third of the team has worked together at westwood for more than ten years 
team continuity plus years of experience are among the critical elements required for successfully managing investments 
investment strategies we offer a broad range of investment strategies allowing us to serve various client types and investment objectives 
over of our assets under management are invested in our largecap value strategy 
the principal investment strategies currently managed by westwood management follow largecap value investments in equity securities of approximately well seasoned companies with market capitalizations generally over billion 
this portfolio is invested in companies where we expect that future profitability  driven by operational improvements  will exceed expectations reflected in current share prices 
dividend growth investments in equity securities of approximately high quality companies with market capitalizations generally over billion 
this portfolio is invested in companies of which at least are paying dividends and whose prospects for dividend growth are strong 
this strategy combines quantitative and fundamental research to create a diversified portfolio of companies we believe can create value for shareholders 
midcap value investments in equity securities of approximately companies with market capitalizations between billion and billion 
similar to the largecap value strategy  we look for mid sized firms with earnings growth driven by operational improvements that can be purchased inexpensively 
smidcap plus investments in equity securities of approximately companies with market capitalizations between billion and billion 
similar to our other value oriented investment strategies  we seek to discover operational improvements driving earnings growth within small to mid sized companies that can be purchased inexpensively 
smidcap value investments in equity securities of approximately companies with market capitalizations between million and billion 
similar to our other value oriented investment strategies  we seek to discover operational improvements driving earnings growth within small to mid size companies that can be purchased inexpensively 
this strategy reached its asset capacity in and is now closed to new investors 

table of contents smallcap value investments in equity securities of approximately companies with market capitalizations between million and billion 
similar to our other value oriented investment strategies  we seek to invest in high quality companies whose earnings growth is driven by operational improvements not yet fully recognized by the market 
allcap value investments in equity securities of approximately well seasoned companies 
the portfolio generally comprises our investment professionals best ideas among companies with market capitalizations above million 
similar to our other value oriented investment strategies  we seek to invest in companies across a broad range of market capitalizations where we expect that future profitability  driven by operational improvements  will be higher than expectations currently reflected in share prices 
balanced investments in a combination of equity and fixed income securities  designed to provide both growth opportunities and income  while also emphasizing asset preservation in down markets 
westwood management applies its expertise in dynamic asset allocation and security selection decisions in carrying out this balanced strategy approach 
income opportunity investments in dividend paying common stocks  preferred stocks  convertible securities  master limited partnerships  royalty trusts  reits and selected debt instruments 
this portfolio s strategy focuses on companies with strong and improving cash flow sufficient to support a sustainable or rising income stream for investors 
this strategy is targeted towards investors seeking current income  a competitive total return and low volatility through dividend paying or interest bearing securities 
master limited partnerships mlps investments include mlps including limited partnerships and general partnerships  securities of tanker and other marine shipping companies and other securities 
within these types of securities  the portfolio focuses on companies that exhibit higher dividend yields  stable and predictable cash flows  low correlations to other asset classes  and growth potential 
investment grade fixed income investments in high grade  intermediate term corporate and government bonds 
we seek to add value to client portfolios through yield curve positioning and investing in debt instruments with improving credit quality potential 
each investment strategy consists of a portfolio of equity or fixed income securities selected by westwood s portfolio teams and chosen to optimize long term returns consistent with westwood s investment philosophy 
our portfolio teams make decisions for westwood management investment strategies in accordance with the investment objectives and policies of such strategies  including determining when and which securities to purchase and sell 
we employ a value oriented approach for our equity investment strategies 
the common thread that permeates these strategies is our disciplined approach to controlling risk and preserving client assets whenever possible 
our investment teams seek to invest in companies with high levels of free cash flow  improving returns on equity  and strengthening balance sheets that are well positioned for growth but whose value is not fully recognized in the marketplace 
through investments in companies that exhibit these characteristics  we seek to demonstrate consistently superior performance relative to our industry peers and relevant benchmark indices 
over of our assets under management are invested in equity securities of companies with large market capitalizations 
when measured over multi year periods of ten years and longer  westwood s principal investment strategies have consistently ranked above peer group median performance rankings according to recognized industry sources  including morningstar  inc our ability to grow assets under management is primarily dependent on our competitive long term performance record  our success in building strong relationships with investment consulting firms and other financial intermediaries as well as our ability to develop new client relationships 
we continually seek to expand assets under management by growing our existing investment strategies as well as developing new ones 
we primarily intend to grow our investment strategies internally but may consider acquiring new investment strategies from third parties  as discussed under growth strategy below 
our growth strategy provides clients with more investment opportunities and diversifies assets under management  thereby reducing risk in any one area of investment and increasing our competitive ability to attract new clients 

table of contents advisory and subadvisory service agreements westwood management manages client accounts under investment advisory and subadvisory agreements 
typical of the asset management industry  such agreements are usually terminable upon short notice and provide for compensation based on the market value of client assets under management 
westwood s advisory fees are paid quarterly in advance based on assets under management on the last day of the preceding quarter  quarterly in arrears based on assets under management on the last day of the previous quarter  or are based on a daily or monthly analysis of assets under management for the stated period 
a few clients have contractual performance based fee arrangements  which generate additional revenues if we outperform a specified index over a specific period of time 
revenue for performance based fees is recorded at the end of the measurement period 
revenue from advance payments is deferred and recognized over the period that services are performed 
pursuant to these agreements  westwood provides overall investment management services  including directing investments in conformity with client established investment objectives and restrictions 
unless otherwise directed in writing by clients  westwood management has the authority to vote all proxies with respect to client assets 
westwood management is a party to subadvisory agreements with other investment advisors under which it performs substantially the same services as it does under its advisory agreements 
our subadvisory fees are generally computed based upon the average daily assets under management and are payable on a monthly basis 
as with our advisory agreements  these agreements are terminable upon short notice 
under our subadvisory agreement with teton advisors  inc  westwood management provides investment advisory services to the gamco westwood funds family of mutual funds 
westwood management owns shares of class a common stock representing a economic interest in teton advisors  inc  an affiliate of gamco investors  inc 
based on sec filings  we believe that gamco investors  inc owned of our common stock as of december  westwood management received subadvisory payments from teton advisors  inc totaling   and  for the twelve months ended december   and  respectively 
while westwood management provides subadvisory services with respect to the gamco westwood funds family of mutual funds  westwood management provides investment advisory services directly to the westwood funds tm family of mutual funds  which includes the westwood income opportunity fund  the westwood smidcap fund  the westwood largecap value fund  the westwood balanced fund  the westwood smallcap value fund  the westwood dividend growth fund  the westwood smidcap plus fund and the westwood short duration high yield fund 
the westwood short duration high yield fund is subadvised by sky harbor capital management  llc  a registered investment adviser based in greenwich  connecticut 
as of december   the westwood funds tm had assets under management of billion 
our four largest clients accounted for approximately of our fee revenues for the year ended december  the loss of some or all of these large clients could have a material adverse affect on our business and our results of operations 
westwood trust general westwood trust provides trust and custodial services and participation in common trust funds that it sponsors to institutions and high net worth individuals and families generally having at least million in assets under management

westwood trust is chartered and regulated by the texas department of banking 

table of contents westwood trust primarily provides services for employee benefit trusts and personal trusts 
employee benefit trusts include retirement plans of businesses to benefit their employees  including defined contribution plans  pensions and profit sharing plans 
westwood trust may also be appointed as a trustee and may provide administrative support for these plans  as well as investment advisory and custodial services 
personal trusts are developed to achieve a number of different objectives and westwood trust acts as trustee to such trusts and assists them in developing tax efficient trust portfolios 
fees charged by westwood trust are separately negotiated with each client and are typically based on assets under management 
services westwood trust undertakes a fiduciary responsibility toward the management of each client s assets and utilizes a consultative asset allocation approach 
this approach involves our examining the client s financial situation  including the client s current portfolio of investments  and advising the client on ways to enhance investment returns and strengthen its financial position 
westwood trust also provides custodial services  safekeeping and accounting services 
common trust funds westwood trust sponsors a number of common trust funds in which client assets are commingled to achieve economies of scale 
westwood trust s common trust funds fall within two basic categories personal trusts and employee benefit trusts 
westwood trust sponsors common trust funds for most of the investment strategies managed by westwood management 
westwood trust also engages third party subadvisors for some common trust funds  such as our growth equity  international equity and high yield bond common trust funds 
enhanced balanced portfolios westwood trust is a strong proponent of asset class diversification and offers its clients the ability to diversify among many different asset classes 
westwood trust enhanced balanced portfolios combine these asset classes into a customizable portfolio for clients seeking to maximize return for a given level of risk 
periodic adjustments are made to asset class weightings in enhanced balanced portfolios based on historical returns  risk and correlation data and our current capital markets outlook 
distribution channels we market our services through several distribution channels to expand the reach of our investment advisory services 
these channels enable us to leverage the distribution infrastructures and capabilities of other financial services firms and intermediaries while focusing on our core competency of developing and managing investment strategies 
institutional investment consultants investment management consulting firms serve as gatekeepers to the majority of corporate retirement plans  public retirement plans  endowments and foundations  which represent westwood s primary institutional target markets 
consultants provide guidance to their clients in setting asset allocation strategy  as well as creating investment policies 
consultants also make recommendations for investment firms they believe can best meet their client s investment objectives 
we have established strong relationships with many national and regional investment consulting firms  which have contributed to our being considered and hired by their clients 
continuing to enhance existing consulting firm relationships  as well as forging new relationships  serves to increase the awareness of our services in both the consultant community and their served institutional client base 
subadvisory relationships our subadvisory relationships allow us to extend the reach of our investment advisory services to clients of other investment companies with broad  established distribution capabilities 
in subadvisory arrangements  our client is typically the investment company through which our services are offered to investors  typically via mutual fund offerings 
the investment company that sponsors the mutual fund is responsible for relevant marketing  distribution  operational and accounting activities 

table of contents managed accounts managed accounts are similar in some respects to subadvisory relationships in that a third party financial institution  such as a brokerage firm or turnkey asset management program provider  handles distribution to the end client 
the end client in a managed account is typically a high net worth individual or small institution 
in these arrangements  the third party financial institution is responsible to the end client for client service  operations and accounting 
growth strategy we believe that we have established a strong platform to support future growth  deriving our strength in large part from the experience and capabilities of our management team and skilled investment professionals 
we believe that this focused  stable team has contributed significantly to our solid investment performance  superior client service and a growing array of investment strategies 
we believe that opportunities for future growth may come from our ability to generate growth from new and existing clients and consultant relationships attract and retain key employees grow assets in our existing investment strategies foster continued growth of the westwood trust platform foster expanded distribution via mutual funds pursue strategic corporate development opportunities continue to strengthen our brand name 
generate growth from new and existing clients and consultant relationships 
as our primary business objective  we intend to maintain and enhance existing relationships with clients and investment consultants by continuing to provide solid investment performance and attentive client service 
we also intend to pursue growth through targeted sales and marketing efforts that emphasize our investment performance and superior client service 
new institutional client accounts are generally derived through investment consultants and we have developed productive long term relationships with many national and regional investment consultants 
we believe that the in depth knowledge of our firm  our people and our processes embedded in our consultant and client relationships is a key factor when being considered for new client investment mandates 
attract and retain key employees 
in order to achieve our investment performance and client relationship objectives  we must be able to retain and attract talented investment professionals 
we believe that we have created a workplace environment in which motivated  performance driven  and client oriented individuals thrive 
as a public company  we are able to offer our employees a compensation program that includes strong equity incentives such that their success will be closely aligned with the success of our clients and stockholders 
we believe that these factors are critical ingredients in maintaining a stable  client focused environment that can support significant future growth 
grow assets in our existing investment strategies 
largecap value is our largest investment strategy in terms of assets under management and we believe it has significant capacity for additional assets 
we have also developed other investment strategies in response to client needs and marketplace opportunities 
we continue to look for opportunities to expand our range of investment strategies and will consider internally developed strategies as well as those that may be acquired externally 
we believe these additional strategies will enable us to grow assets under management 
for instance  we have achieved such significant growth in assets in our smidcap value strategy since we began marketing it to institutions in that it was closed to new investors in the westwood smidcap mutual fund only remains open to existing shareholders 
in july we launched the smidcap plus strategy  managed by the same team responsible for the smidcap strategy 
we believe smidcap plus is an attractive investment alternative for clients looking to invest in small to mid size companies and it exceeded million in assets under management by the end of last year 
assets in our income opportunity strategy grew substantially in  exceeding million at the end of  as the strategy continued to receive strong interest from our private wealth and mutual fund channels as well as from additional institutional mandates 
based upon increased interest in our allcap value strategy in  we believe that the allcap approach is now accepted as a viable strategy in the institutional marketplace 
we have the team in place to support these investment strategies in our target institutional  private wealth and mutual fund markets 
if we continue to deliver strong investment performance  we believe that demand for these strategies can provide meaningful growth in assets under management 

table of contents foster continued growth of the westwood trust platform 
westwood trust has experienced solid growth in serving small to medium sized institutions as well as high net worth individuals and families 
we anticipate continued interest from clients and prospects in our diversified  highly attentive service model 
a significant percentage of new asset growth at westwood trust stems from referrals and gathering additional assets from existing clients 
we believe that our enhanced balanced strategy  which offers diversified exposure to multiple asset classes in a tax efficient  comprehensive solution for clients  provides opportunities for growth 
our acquisition of mccarthy group advisors  llc in omaha  nebraska  enabled us to introduce westwood trust to a new served market with attractive growth opportunities for our products and services 
foster expanded distribution via mutual funds 
we started the westwood funds tm family of mutual funds in with the launch of westwood smidcap whgmx and westwood income opportunity whgix 
subsequently we have launched six additional funds westwood largecap value whglx  westwood balanced whgbx  westwood smallcap value whgsx  westwood dividend growth whgdx  westwood smidcap plus whgpx and westwood short duration high yield whghx 
we believe that providing investors access to our investment strategies via mutual funds is a key component to achieving asset growth in the defined contribution and retirement marketplaces and in the registered investment advisor distribution channel 
with the exception of westwood short duration high yield  which is subadvised by sky harbor capital management  llc  the westwood funds tm mirror our institutional strategies 
the funds offer capped expense ratios and are available in an institutional share class for all funds 
we have also launched a shares for westwood largecap value and westwood income opportunity in order to target no transaction fee ntf mutual fund supermarket platforms and the broker dealer marketplace 
pursue strategic corporate development opportunities 
we carefully evaluate strategic corporate development opportunities in order to augment organic growth 
we may pursue various transactions  including acquisition of asset management firms  mutual funds or private wealth firms as well as hiring investment professionals or teams 
we consider opportunities to enhance our existing operations  expand our range of investment strategies and services or further develop our distribution capabilities 
by acquiring investment firms or by hiring investment professionals or teams that successfully manage investment strategies beyond our current expertise  we can attract new clients and provide existing clients with an even more diversified range of investment strategies 
we may also consider forging alliances with other financial services firms to leverage our core competency of developing superior investment strategies in combination with alliance partners who could provide enhanced distribution capabilities or additional service offerings 
continue to strengthen our brand name 
we believe that the strength of our brand name has been a key component to our long term success in the investment industry and will be instrumental to our future success 
we have developed our strong brand name largely through excellent performance coupled with high profile coverage in investment publications and electronic media 
several of our investment professionals  including susan byrne  mark freeman  david spika and ragen stienke  have been visible in print and electronic media and we will continue to look for creative ways to strengthen our brand name and reputation in our target markets 
competition we are subject to substantial and growing competition in all aspects of our business 
barriers to entry to the asset management business are relatively low and we expect to face a growing number of competitors 
although no one company dominates the asset management industry  many companies are larger  better known and have greater resources than we do 
further  we compete with other asset management firms on the basis of investment strategies offered  the investment performance of those strategies both in absolute terms and relative to peer groups  quality of service  fees charged  the level and type of compensation offered to key employees  and the manner in which investment strategies are marketed 
many of our competitors offer more investment strategies and services than we do and have substantially greater assets under management 

table of contents we compete against numerous investment dealers  banks  insurance companies and others that sell equity funds  taxable income funds  tax free investments and other investment products 
in addition  the allocation of assets by many investors from active equity investment to index funds  fixed income or similar asset classes has enhanced the ability of firms offering non equity asset classes and passive equity management to compete with us effectively 
in summary  our competitive landscape is intense and dynamic and we may not be able to compete effectively in the future as an independent company 
additionally  most prospective clients perform a thorough review of an investment manager s background  investment policies and performance before committing assets to that manager 
in many cases  prospective clients invite a number of competing firms to make presentations 
the process of obtaining a new client typically takes twelve to eighteen months from the time of the initial contact 
while we have achieved a high degree of success in competing successfully for new clients  it is a process to which we must dedicate significant resources over an extended period  with no certainty of success

these laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investment advisory clients and stockholders of registered investment advisers

we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the requirements of the regulations under the investment advisers act  the investment company act and the usa patriot act 
westwood trust westwood trust operates in a highly regulated environment and is subject to extensive supervision and examination 
as a texas chartered trust company  westwood trust is subject to the texas finance code the finance code  the rules and regulations promulgated under the finance code and supervision by the texas department of banking 
these laws are intended primarily for the protection of westwood trust s clients and creditors rather than for the benefit of investors 
the finance code provides for and regulates a variety of matters  such as minimum capital maintenance requirements restrictions on dividends restrictions on investments of restricted capital

table of contents item a 
risk factors we believe these represent the material risks currently facing our business 
our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by these risks 
the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision 
you should also refer to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report  including our financial statements and related notes 
poor investment performance of assets managed by us could adversely affect our results of operations 
because we compete with many asset management firms on the basis of the investment strategies we offer  our success is dependent to a significant extent on the investment performance of the assets that we manage 
because our revenue is primarily generated from fees derived as a percentage of assets under management  poor performance tends to result in the loss or reduction of client accounts  which correspondingly decreases revenues 
underperformance relative to peer groups for our various investment strategies could adversely affect our results of operations  especially if such underperformance continues for a lengthy period of time 
some key employees are considered critical to our success  and our inability to attract and retain key employees could compromise our future success 
we believe that our future success will depend to a significant extent upon the services of our certain key employees  particularly brian o 
casey  president and chief executive officer  mark freeman  chief investment officer  and ragen stienke  senior portfolio manager 
as with other asset management businesses  our future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of these and other key officers  investment professionals  as well as marketing  client service and management personnel 
there is substantial competition for skilled personnel and the loss of key employees or our failure to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel  could negatively impact our business  financial condition  results of operations and future prospects 
our revenues are dependent upon the performance of the securities markets and negative performance of the securities markets could reduce our revenues 
our results of operations are affected by many economic factors  including the performance of the securities markets 
negative performance within the securities markets or short term volatility within the securities markets could result in investors withdrawing assets  decreasing their rates of investment or shifting assets to cash or other asset classes or strategies that we do not manage  all of which could reduce our revenues 
because most of our revenues are based on the value of assets under management  a decline in the value of those assets would also adversely affect our revenues 
in addition  in periods of slowing growth or declining revenues  profits and profit margins are adversely affected because certain expenses remain relatively fixed 
in particular  a significant portion of our assets under management is invested in equity securities of companies with large market capitalizations 
as a consequence  we are particularly susceptible to the volatility associated with changes in the market for large capitalization stocks 
due to this concentration  any change or reduction in such markets  including a shift of our clients and potential clients preference from investments in equity securities of large capitalization stocks to other equity or fixed income securities could have a significant negative impact on our revenues and results of operations 
this negative impact could occur due to the depreciation in value of our assets under management  the election by clients to select other firms to manage their assets or the election by clients to allocate assets away from asset classes that we manage 
any of these events would result in decreased assets under management and therefore reduced revenues and a decline in results of operations 

table of contents if we are unable to realize benefits from the costs we have incurred and are continuing to incur to develop new investment strategies and otherwise broaden our capabilities  our growth opportunities may be adversely affected 
we have incurred significant costs to develop new investment strategies  including smallcap value  allcap value  income opportunity  midcap value  largecap enhanced  global strategic diversification  an mlp portfolio and smidcap plus  to launch new mutual funds under the westwood funds tm name and to upgrade our business infrastructure and we expect to continue to incur significant costs to develop and launch new investment strategies 
some costs associated with these improvements and new investment strategies will continue to be incurred in future periods and are relatively fixed 
we may not realize the benefits of these investments and  if unable to do so  our results of operations and growth opportunities may be adversely affected 
due to the substantial cost and time required to introduce new investment strategies in our industry  we may not be able to successfully introduce new investment strategies in a timely manner  or at all 
the development of new investment strategies  whether through acquisition or internal development  requires a substantial amount of time and significant financial resources  including expenses related to compensation  sales and marketing  information technology  legal counsel and other professional services 
our ability to market and sell a new investment strategy depends on our financial resources  the investment performance of the specific strategy  the timing of the offering and our marketing strategies 
once an investment strategy is developed  we must effectively market the strategy to existing and prospective clients 
our ability to sell new investment strategies to existing and prospective clients depends on our ability to meet or exceed the performance of our competitors who offer the same or similar strategy 
we may not be able to manage the assets within a given investment strategy profitably 
moreover  it may take years before we are able to produce the level of results that will enable us to attract clients 
if we are unable to realize the benefits of the costs and expenses incurred in developing new investment strategies  we may experience losses as a result of our management of these investment strategies  and our ability to introduce further new investment strategies and compete in our industry may be hampered 
our business is dependent on investment advisory  subadvisory and trust agreements that are subject to termination or non renewal 
as a result  we could lose any of our clients on very short notice 
substantially all of our revenues are derived pursuant to investment advisory  subadvisory and trust agreements with our clients 
in general  either party may terminate these agreements upon days notice 
any termination of  or failure to renew  a material number of these agreements could have a material adverse impact on us  particularly because many of our costs are relatively fixed 
a small number of clients account for a substantial portion of our business 
as such  the reduction or loss of business with any of these clients could have a significantly adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our four largest clients accounted for approximately of fee revenues for the year ended december  we are dependent to a significant degree on our ability to maintain existing relationships with these clients 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining these existing client relationships  securing additional clients or achieving the superior investment performance necessary to earn performance based advisory fees 
any failure by us to retain one or more of these large clients or establish profitable relationships with additional clients could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
competitive fee pressures could reduce revenues and profit margins 
the investment management business is highly competitive and has relatively low barriers to entry 
to the extent we have to compete on the basis of price  we may not be able to maintain our current fee structure 
although our investment management fees vary from product to product  we have competed primarily on the performance of our products and client service rather than on the level of our investment management fees relative to our competitors 
in recent years there has been a trend toward lower fees in the investment management industry 
in order to maintain our fee structure in a competitive environment  we must be able to continue to provide clients with investment returns and service that make investors willing to pay our fees 
we cannot be assured that we will succeed in providing investment returns and service that will allow us to maintain our current fee structure 
fee reductions on existing or future new business could have an adverse effect on our profit margins and results of operations 

table of contents performance fees could have a significant effect on our revenues and results of operations 
we have performance fee agreements with a few clients  which pay us a fee if we outperform a specified index over predetermined periods of time 
we may not be able to outperform such indexes and the failure to do so would cause us to earn none or only part of those potential revenues  which would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 
our revenues from performance based fees could fluctuate significantly from one measurement period to the next  depending on how we perform relative to the indexes specified in these agreements 
for example  we earned a performance fee in  but did not earn performance fees in or any event that negatively affects the asset management industry in general could have a material adverse effect on us 
any event affecting the asset management industry that results in a general decrease in assets under management or a significant general decline in the number of advisory clients or accounts could negatively impact our revenues 
our future growth and success depends in part upon the growth of the asset management industry 
our business is subject to extensive regulation with attendant costs of compliance and serious consequences for violations 
virtually all aspects of our business are subject to various laws and regulations including the investment advisers act  the investment company act  and anti money laundering laws 
these laws and regulations generally grant regulatory agencies broad administrative powers  including the power to limit or restrict us from operating our business as well as the powers to place us under conservatorship or closure in the event we fail to comply with such laws and regulations 
violations of such laws or regulations could subject us or our employees to disciplinary proceedings and civil or criminal liability  including revocation of licenses  censures  fines or temporary suspensions  permanent barring from the conduct of business  conservatorship  or closure 
any such proceeding or liability could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition  results of operations and business prospects 
due to the extensive regulations and laws to which we are subject  our management is required to devote substantial time and effort to legal and regulatory compliance issues 
in addition  the regulatory environment in which we operate is subject to change 
we may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations 
see item business regulation 
misuse of assets and information in the possession of our investment professionals and employees could result in costly litigation and liability for us and our clients 
our investment professionals handle significant amounts of assets along with financial and personal information for our clients 
we have implemented a system of controls to minimize the risk of a fraudulent taking or misuse of assets and information  however our controls may not be sufficiently adequate to prevent such fraudulent actions by our portfolio managers or employees 
if our controls are ineffective  we could be subject to costly litigation  which could consume financial resources  distract management and result in regulatory sanctions 
such fraudulent actions could also adversely affect clients  causing them to seek redress 
acquisitions involve inherent risks that could compromise the success of the combined business and dilute the holdings of current stockholders 
as part of our long term business strategy  we may pursue corporate development transactions including the acquisition of asset management firms  mutual funds  private wealth firms  investment professionals or teams 
see item business growth strategy 
if we are incorrect when assessing the value  strengths  weaknesses  liabilities and potential profitability of such transactions  or if we fail to integrate the acquired businesses or individuals  the success of the combined business could be compromised 
any business acquisitions are subject to the risks commonly associated with such transactions including  among others  potential exposure to unknown liabilities of acquired companies and to acquisition costs and expenses  the difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies  potential disruptions to the business of the combined company and potential diversion of management s time 
table of contents and attention  the impairment of relationships with and the possible loss of key employees and clients as a result of changes in management  potential litigation or other legal risks  potential write downs related to goodwill impairment in connection with acquisitions  and dilution to the stockholders of the combined company if the acquisition is made for stock of the combined company 
in addition  investment strategies  technologies or businesses of acquired companies may not be effectively assimilated into our business or may have a negative effect on the combined company s revenues or earnings 
the combined company may also incur significant expense to complete acquisitions and support acquired investment strategies and businesses 
further  any such acquisitions may be funded with cash  debt or equity  which could have the effect of diluting the holdings or limiting the rights of stockholders 
finally  we may not be successful in identifying attractive acquisition candidates or completing acquisitions on favorable terms 
our acquisitions were forecasted to add revenues  expenses and earnings to our business 
the failure to realize these revenues and earnings could adversely impact our results of operations 
we have made two business acquisitions in the last three years 
these acquisitions may not yield the benefits that we forecasted due to a variety of factors  including our failure to retain the clients of the businesses we acquired 
if these acquisitions do not yield expected benefits  our revenues and results of operations could be negatively impacted and we could be required to record an impairment against earnings for the intangible assets and goodwill acquired in these transactions 
our business involves risks of being engaged in litigation and liability that could increase our expenses and reduce our results of operations many aspects of our business involve substantial risks of liability 
we could be named as defendants or co defendants in lawsuits or could be involved in disputes that involve the threat of lawsuits seeking substantial damages 
as an sec registered adviser  mutual fund adviser and publicly traded entity  we are subject to governmental and self regulatory organization examinations  investigations and proceedings 
similarly  the investment strategies that we manage could be subject to actual and threatened lawsuits and governmental and self regulatory organization investigations and proceedings  any of which could harm the investment returns or reputation of the applicable fund or result in our being liable for any resulting damages 
there has been an increased incidence of litigation and regulatory investigations in the asset management industry in recent years  including customer claims as well as class action suits seeking substantial damages 
various factors may hinder the declaration and payment of dividends 
we have historically paid a quarterly dividend 
however  payment of future dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors  and various factors may prevent us from paying dividends 
such factors include our financial position  capital requirements and liquidity  the existence of a stock repurchase program  state corporate and banking law restrictions  results of operations and such other factors as our board of directors may consider relevant 
in addition  as a holding company  our ability to pay dividends is dependent on the dividends and income we receive from our subsidiaries 
currently  our primary source of cash consists of dividends from westwood management or westwood trust 
the payment of dividends by westwood management or westwood trust is subject to the discretion of their boards of directors and compliance with applicable laws  including  in particular  the provisions of the texas finance code applicable to westwood trust 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our business is vulnerable to systems failures that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
any delays or inaccuracies in securities pricing information or information processing could give rise to claims against us  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are highly dependent on communications and information systems and on third party vendors for securities pricing information and updates from certain software 
we may suffer a systems failure or interruption  whether caused by an earthquake  fire  other natural disaster  power or telecommunications failure  unauthorized access  act of god  act of war or otherwise  and our back up procedures and capabilities may be inadequate to eliminate the risk of extended interruptions in operations 

table of contents we may not be able to fund future capital requirements on favorable terms  if at all 
we cannot be certain that financing to fund our working capital or other cash requirements  if needed  will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
our capital requirements may vary greatly from quarter to quarter depending on  among other things  capital expenditures  fluctuations in our operating results and financing activities 
if future financing becomes necessary  we may or may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms  if at all 
further  any future equity financings could dilute the relative percentage ownership of then existing common stockholders and any future debt financings could involve restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take certain actions 
failure to maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price 
effective internal controls are necessary to provide reliable financial reports 
if we cannot provide reliable financial reports  our brand and operating results could be harmed 
all internal control systems  no matter how well designed  have inherent limitations and even systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation 
we cannot be certain that the measures we take to evaluate and improve our internal controls will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting 
any failure to implement required new or improved controls  or difficulties encountered in their implementation  could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations 
if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls  as such standards are modified  supplemented or amended from time to time  we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 
our organizational documents contain provisions that may prevent or deter another group from paying a premium over the market price to our stockholders to acquire our stock 
our organizational documents contain provisions that require a vote of two thirds of the shares of stock entitled to vote to remove directors for cause  establish that stockholders cannot act by written consent  and that authorize our board of directors to issue  without shareholder approval  blank check preferred stock 
in addition  as a delaware corporation  we are subject to section of the delaware general corporation law relating to business combinations 
these provisions could delay  deter or prevent a merger  consolidation  tender offer or other business combination or change of control involving us that could include a premium over the market price of our common stock that some or a majority of our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests 
we are a holding company and are dependent on the operations and funds of our subsidiaries 
we are a holding company  with no revenue generating operations and no assets other than our ownership interests in westwood management and westwood trust 
accordingly  we are dependent on the cash flow generated by these operating subsidiaries and must rely on dividends or other intercompany transfers from our operating subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet our obligations

we have been providing investment advisory services since and  according to recognized industry sources including morningstar  inc  our principal investment strategies have consistently ranked above median performance within their peer groups when measured over multi year periods 

table of contents with respect to the bulk of our client assets under management  we utilize a value investment style focused on achieving superior long term  risk adjusted returns by investing in companies with high levels of free cash flow  improving returns on equity  strengthening balance sheets and well positioned for growth but whose value is not fully recognized in the marketplace

revenues we derive revenues from investment advisory fees  trust fees  and other revenues 
our advisory fees are generated by westwood management  which manages client accounts under investment advisory and subadvisory agreements 
advisory fees are calculated based on a percentage of assets under management and are paid in accordance with the terms of the agreements 
westwood management s advisory fees are paid quarterly in advance based on assets under management on the last day of the preceding quarter  quarterly in arrears based on assets under management on the last day of the previous quarter  or are based on a daily or monthly analysis of assets under management for the stated period 
westwood management recognizes revenues as services are rendered 
a limited number of our clients have agreed to contractual performance based fees  which generate additional revenues if we 
table of contents outperform a specified index over a specific period of time 
we record revenue for performance based fees at the end of the measurement periods 
since most of our advance paying clients billing periods coincide with the calendar quarter to which payment relates  revenue related to those clients is fully recognized within the quarter 
consequently  there is not a significant amount of deferred revenue contained in our financial statements 
our trust fees are generated by westwood trust pursuant to trust or custodial agreements 
trust fees are separately negotiated with each client and are generally based on a percentage of assets under management 
westwood trust also provides trust services to a small number of clients on a fixed fee basis 
most trust fees are paid quarterly in advance and are recognized as services are rendered 
since billing periods for the majority of westwood trust s advance paying clients coincide with the calendar quarter to which payment relates  revenue is fully recognized within the quarter and consequently there is not a significant amount of deferred revenue contained in our financial statements 
our other revenues generally consist of interest and investment income

supplemental financial information as supplemental information  we are providing non generally accepted accounting principles non gaap performance measures that we refer to as economic earnings and economic expenses 
we provide these measures in addition to  but not as a substitute for  net income and total expenses  which are reported on a us generally accepted accounting principles gaap basis 
management and the board of directors review economic earnings and economic expenses to evaluate ongoing performance  allocate resources and review dividend policy 
we believe that these non gaap performance measures  while not substitutes for gaap net income and total expenses  are useful for both management and investors to evaluate our underlying operating and financial performance and our available resources 
we do not advocate that investors consider these non gaap measures without considering financial information prepared in accordance with gaap 
in calculating economic earnings  we add to net income the non cash expense associated with equity based compensation awards of restricted stock and stock options  amortization of intangible assets and the deferred taxes related to the tax basis amortization of goodwill 
we define economic expenses as total expenses less non cash equity based compensation expense and amortization of intangible assets 
although depreciation on property and equipment is a non cash expense  we do not add it back when calculating economic earnings or deduct it when calculating economic expenses because depreciation charges represent a decline in the value of the related assets that will ultimately require replacement

net income add restricted stock expense add intangible amortization add tax benefit from goodwill amortization economic earnings total expenses less restricted stock expense less intangible amortization economic expenses liquidity and capital resources as of december in thousands balance sheet data assets cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable total liquid assets investments for the years ended december cash flow data operating cash flows investing cash flows financing cash flows historically we have funded our operations and cash requirements with cash generated from operating activities 
as of december   we had no long term debt 
the changes in net cash provided by operating activities generally reflect the changes in earnings plus the effect of non cash items and changes in working capital 
changes in working capital  especially accounts receivable and accounts payable  are generally the result of timing differences between collection of fees billed and payment of operating expenses 
during  cash flow provided by operating activities  principally our investment advisory business  was million compared to cash provided by operations of million during and million during the increase of  was primarily due to increased net income and an increase in accounts and compensation payables  partially offset by increased net purchases of us treasury bills 
the increase of million from to was primarily due to increased net income  reduced net purchases of us treasury bills and an increase in accounts and compensation payables  partially offset by higher accounts receivable 

table of contents cash flow used in investing activities during of million primarily reflected the purchase of property and equipment and cash paid to acquire businesses 
cash flow used in investing activities during was million and was primarily related to cash paid to acquire businesses 
cash flow used in investing activities during of million was primarily related to net sales of available for sale investments and cash paid to acquire a business 
cash used in financing activities of million  million and million during  and  respectively  primarily related to payment of cash dividends and purchase of treasury stock  partially offset by excess tax benefits related to vested restricted shares and proceeds from the issuance of stock upon option exercises 
we held cash and investments of million and million at december  and december   respectively 
at december  and  working capital aggregated million and million respectively 
as required by the texas finance code  westwood trust maintains current assets in an amount equal to the required minimum restricted capital of million  which is included in investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
we had no liabilities for borrowed money at december  or december   and our accounts payable were paid in the ordinary course of business for each of the periods then ended 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including our results of operations  the timing and magnitude of capital expenditures or strategic initiatives  our dividend policy and other business and risk factors described in this form k 
we believe that current cash and short term investment balances and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet the operating and capital requirements of our ordinary business operations through at least the next twelve months 
however  there can be no assurance that we will not require additional financing within this time frame 
a failure to raise needed capital on attractive terms  if at all  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands 
payments due in contractual obligations total less than year years years after years operating lease obligations accounting developments in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new guidance regarding the presentation of comprehensive income 
under this new guidance  an entity must present the components of net income and comprehensive income in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the new guidance eliminates the option to present other comprehensive income in the statement of shareholders equity 
the new guidance becomes effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  we have adopted this guidance early in the financial statements presented in this form k however it did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued new guidance regarding testing of goodwill for impairment  which allows entities to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value in order to determine if quantitative testing is required 
this optional qualitative assessment is intended to reduce the cost and complexity of annual goodwill impairment tests 
the new guidance is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  and early adoption is allowed provided the entity has not yet performed its impairment test or issued its financial statements 
this guidance will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent losses and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
in applying accounting principles  we often must make individual estimates and assumptions regarding expected outcomes or uncertainties 
our estimates  judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience 
because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following are areas where the degree of judgment and complexity in determining amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements make accounting policies critical 
historically  actual results have not differed materially from estimates 
goodwill during the third quarters of  and  we completed our annual impairment assessment as required by asc goodwill and other intangible assets 
no impairment losses were required 
we perform our annual impairment assessment as of july and would reassess if circumstances indicated a potential impairment between our annual assessment dates 
we assess the fair value of our business units with goodwill using a market multiple approach 
we reevaluated our assessment at the end of and determined that no events occurred in the last half of that would indicate that these assets should be retested for impairment 
intangible assets our intangible assets represent the acquisition date fair value of the intangible assets acquired and are reflected net of amortization 
the values of these assets are comprised mostly of customer lists but also include valuations of trade names and non compete agreements 
in valuing these assets  we made significant estimates regarding the useful life  growth rates and potential attrition of the assets acquired 
we periodically review our intangible assets for events or circumstances that would indicate impairment and we would record an impairment to remove the excess if their carrying value exceeded fair value 
restricted stock we have granted restricted stock to employees and non employee directors 
we calculate compensation cost for restricted stock grants by using the fair market value of our common stock at the date of grant  the number of shares issued and an estimate of shares that will not vest due to forfeitures 
this compensation cost is amortized on a straight line basis over the applicable vesting period 
the estimate of shares that will not vest due to forfeitures is based on our historical forfeiture rate and our expectation of potential forfeitures  which is dependent upon our judgment 
if actual experience differs significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected 
if forfeitures of restricted stock do not occur or are significantly less than our estimation  we would record as much as  of additional compensation costs over the next two years 
accounting for income taxes our provision for income taxes reflects the statutory tax obligations of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment and complex calculations are used when determining our tax liability and in evaluating our tax positions 
we adjust our income tax provision in the period in which we determine that actual outcomes will likely be different from our estimates 
changes in tax laws may result in changes to our tax position and effective tax rates 
we classify any interest or penalties related to income taxes as a component of income tax expense 
deferred income taxes reflect the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of our assets and liabilities as measured at enacted income tax rates 
our deferred taxes relate principally to stock based compensation expense  which is deductible for tax purposes at the time restricted stock vests and stock options are exercised 

table of contents revenue recognition investment advisory and trust fees are recognized in the period the services are provided 
these fees are determined in accordance with contracts between our subsidiaries and their clients and are generally based on a percentage of assets under management 
performance based fees are due if we outperform a specified index over a specific period of time 
we record revenue for performance based fees at the end of the measurement period when the fees have been fully earned 
accounting for investments we have designated our investments  other than shares of teton advisors  inc teton shares  as trading securities  which are recorded at market value with related unrealized gains and losses reflected in other revenues in our consolidated statements of income 
our trading securities  primarily us government and government agency obligations  money market holdings and mutual fund and common trust fund shares  are valued based upon quoted market prices and  with respect to funds  reported net asset values of shares held 
we have designated our investments in the teton shares as available for sale 
the teton shares are carried at quoted market value with a discount for lack of marketability 
unrealized gains and losses on the teton shares are recorded through other comprehensive income 
dividends and interest on all of our investments are accrued as earned 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our corporate capital in various financial instruments such as united states treasury bills  equity mutual funds and united states government agency obligations  which entail certain inherent market risks 
we do not currently participate in any hedging activities  nor do we currently utilize any derivative financial instruments 
the following information describes the key aspects of certain financial instruments that involve market risks 
interest rates and securities markets our cash equivalents and other investment instruments are exposed to financial market risk due to fluctuations in interest rates  which may affect interest income 
we do not expect interest income to be significantly affected by sudden changes in market interest rates 
the value of assets under management is affected by changes in interest rates and fluctuations in securities markets 
since we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from investment advisory and trust fees based on the value of assets under management  our revenues may be adversely affected by changing interest rates or a decline in the prices of securities generally
