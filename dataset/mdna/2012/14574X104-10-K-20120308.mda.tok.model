the following is an overview of the key financial measures discussed in our results of operations restaurant sales consist of food and beverage sales  net of discounts  at our company owned and operated restaurants 
restaurant sales are influenced by changes in comparable restaurant sales  menu price increases  new restaurant openings and closures of restaurants 
restaurants are included in comparable restaurant sales after they have been open for months for our burger king restaurants and months for our pollo tropical and taco cabana restaurants 
for comparative purposes  the calculation of the changes in comparable restaurant sales is based on a week year 
for purposes of calculating the changes in comparable restaurant sales for  a week year  we have excluded restaurant sales for the extra week of cost of sales consists of food  paper and beverage costs including packaging costs  less purchase discounts 
cost of sales is generally influenced by changes in commodity costs  the sales mix of items sold and the effectiveness of our restaurant level controls to manage food and paper costs 
key commodities for our pollo tropical and taco cabana restaurants  including chicken and beef  are generally purchased under contracts for future periods up to one year 
restaurant wages and related expenses include all restaurant management and hourly productive labor costs  employer payroll taxes  restaurant level bonuses and related benefits 
payroll and related benefits are subject to inflation  including minimum wage increases and increased costs for health insurance  workers compensation insurance and state unemployment insurance

general and administrative expenses are comprised primarily of salaries and expenses associated with corporate and administrative functions that support the development and operations of our restaurants  legal  auditing and other professional fees  including costs in connection with the spin off of fiesta restaurant group  and stock based compensation expense

depreciation and amortization primarily includes the depreciation of fixed assets  including equipment  owned buildings and leasehold improvements utilized in our restaurants  depreciation of assets under lease financing obligations and the amortization of burger king franchise rights and franchise fees 
impairment and other lease charges are determined through our assessment of the recoverability of property and equipment and intangible assets by determining whether the carrying value of these assets can be recovered over their respective remaining lives through undiscounted future operating cash flows 
a potential impairment charge is evaluated whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable

recent and future events affecting our results of operations spin off of fiesta restaurant group  inc on february  we announced our intention to split our business into two separate  publicly traded companies through the tax free spin off of the common stock of fiesta restaurant group to our stockholders in the form of a pro rata dividend 
upon the consummation of the spin off  fiesta restaurant group would continue to own and operate our pollo tropical and taco cabana businesses and we would continue to own and operate our franchised burger king restaurants through our subsidiaries carrols and carrols llc 
we believe that the proposed spin off will enable each company to better focus on its respective opportunities as well as to pursue its own distinct operating plan and growth strategy including potential acquisition opportunities in the burger king system 
the completion of the spin off remains conditioned on  among other things  final approval of our board of directors  receipt of a favorable private letter tax ruling from the irs  which has been received  the effectiveness of fiesta restaurant group s registration statement on form filed with the sec with respect to the registration of its common stock under the exchange act and final

refinancing of outstanding indebtedness on august   we completed a refinancing of our existing indebtedness 
carrols llc and fiesta restaurant group each entered into new and independent financing arrangements

total interest expense in increased by million as a result of these transactions 
future restaurant closures we evaluate the performance of our burger king restaurants on an ongoing basis including an assessment of the current and future operating results of the restaurant  and in relation to burger king franchise agreement renewals  the cost of required capital improvements 
we may elect to close restaurants based on such evaluation 
in  we closed eight burger king restaurants  not including restaurants relocated within the same market area 
we currently anticipate that we will close an additional three burger king restaurants in  excluding any burger king restaurants which we may close and relocate 
we also closed two underperforming pollo tropical restaurants and one underperforming taco cabana restaurant in we currently anticipate the closing of two to four pollo tropical and taco cabana restaurants in we do not believe that the future impact on our consolidated results of operations from such restaurant closures will be material  although there can be no assurance in this regard 
our determination of whether to close restaurants in the future is subject to further evaluation and may change

off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements other than our operating leases  which are primarily for our restaurant properties and not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
inflation the inflationary factors that have historically affected our results of operations include increases in food and paper costs  labor and other operating expenses and energy costs 
wages paid in our restaurants are impacted by changes in the federal and state hourly minimum wage rates 
accordingly  changes in the federal and state hourly minimum wage rates directly affect our labor costs 
we typically attempt to offset the effect of inflation  at least in part  through periodic menu price increases and various cost reduction programs 
however  no assurance can be given that we will be able to offset such inflationary cost increases in the future 
application of critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparing consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by the application of our accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are described in the significant accounting policies footnote in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting estimates are those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
sales recognition at our company owned and operated restaurants is straightforward as customers pay for products at the time of sale and inventory turns over very quickly 
payments to vendors for products sold in the restaurants are generally settled within days 
the earnings reporting process is covered by our system of internal controls and generally does not require significant management estimates and judgments 
however  critical accounting estimates and judgments  as noted below  are inherent in the assessment and recording of accrued occupancy costs  insurance liabilities  income taxes  the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets for impairment  assessing impairment of long lived assets and lease accounting matters 
while we apply our judgment based on assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  actual results could vary from these assumptions 
it is possible that materially different amounts would be reported using different assumptions 
accrued occupancy costs 
we make estimates of accrued occupancy costs pertaining to closed restaurant locations on an ongoing basis 
these estimates require assessment and continuous evaluation of a number of factors such as the remaining contractual period under our lease obligations  the amount of sublease income we are able to realize on a particular property and estimates of other costs such as property taxes 
differences between actual future events and prior estimates could result in adjustments to these accrued costs 
total accrued occupancy costs pertaining to closed restaurant locations was million at december  insurance liabilities 
we are insured for workers compensation  general liability and medical insurance claims under policies where we pay all claims  subject to annual stop loss limitations both for individual claims and claims in the aggregate 
at december   we had million accrued for these insurance claims 
we record insurance liabilities based on historical and industry trends  which are continually monitored  and adjust 
table of contents accruals as warranted by changing circumstances 
since there are estimates and assumptions inherent in recording these insurance liabilities  including the ability to estimate the future development of incurred claims based on historical trends or the severity of the claims  differences between actual future events and prior estimates and assumptions could result in adjustments to these liabilities 
evaluation of goodwill 
we must evaluate our recorded goodwill for impairment on an ongoing basis 
we have elected to conduct our annual impairment review of goodwill assets at december our review at december  indicated there was no impairment as of that date 
in reviewing goodwill for impairment  we compare the net book values of our reporting units to their estimated fair values 
in determining the estimated fair values of the reporting units  we employ a combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and a market based approach 
assumptions include our anticipated growth rates and the weighted average cost of capital 
the results of these analyses are corroborated with other value indicators where available  such as comparable company earnings multiples 
this annual evaluation of goodwill requires us to make estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of our reporting units including projections regarding future operating results and market values 
we had three reporting units with goodwill balances as of our most recent measurement date 
the fair value exceeded the carrying value of our respective reporting units by almost for our pollo tropical restaurants  more than for our taco cabana restaurants and more than for our burger king restaurants 
these estimates may differ from actual future events and if these estimates or related projections change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
impairment of long lived assets 
we assess the potential impairment of long lived assets  principally property and equipment  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we determine if there is impairment at the restaurant level by comparing undiscounted future cash flows from the related long lived assets to their respective carrying values 
in determining future cash flows  significant estimates are made by us with respect to future operating results of each restaurant over its remaining lease term  including sales trends  labor rates  commodity costs and other operating cost assumptions 
if assets are determined to be impaired  the impairment charge is measured by calculating the amount by which the asset carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
this process of assessing fair values requires the use of estimates and assumptions  including our ability to sell the related assets and market conditions  which are subject to a high degree of judgment 
if these assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
impairment of burger king franchise rights 
we assess the potential impairment of burger king franchise rights whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we determine if there is impairment by comparing the aggregate undiscounted future cash flows from those acquired restaurants with the respective carrying value of franchise rights for each burger king acquisition 
in determining future cash flows  significant estimates are made by us with respect to future operating results of the acquired restaurants including sales trends  labor rates  commodity costs and other operating cost assumptions over their remaining franchise life 
if acquired franchise rights are determined to be impaired  the impairment charge is measured by calculating the amount by which the franchise rights carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
this process requires the use of estimates and assumptions  which are subject to a high degree of judgment 
if these assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
lease accounting 
judgments made by management for our lease obligations include the length of the lease term  which includes the determination of renewal options that are reasonably assured 
the lease term can affect the classification of a lease as capital or operating for accounting purposes  the term over which related leasehold improvements for each restaurant are amortized  and any rent holidays and or changes in rental amounts for recognizing rent expense over the term of the lease 
these judgments may produce materially different amounts of depreciation  amortization and rent expense than would be reported if different assumed lease terms were used 
we also must evaluate sales of our restaurants which occur in sale leaseback transactions to determine the proper accounting for the proceeds of such sales either as a sale or a financing 
this evaluation requires certain 
table of contents judgments in determining whether or not clauses in the lease or any related agreements constitute continuing involvement 
for those sale leasebacks that are accounted for as financing transactions  we must estimate our incremental borrowing rate  or another rate in cases where the incremental borrowing rate is not appropriate to utilize  for purposes of determining interest expense and the resulting amortization of the lease financing obligation 
changes in the determination of the incremental borrowing rates or other rates utilized in connection with the accounting for lease financing transactions could have a significant effect on the interest expense and underlying balance of the lease financing obligations 
effects of new accounting standards in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance on testing goodwill for impairment 
the guidance provides entities an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary 
this guidance is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted  provided that the entity has not yet performed its annual impairment test or issued its financial statements 
we are evaluating the impact of this guidance on our annual testing for goodwill impairment in in september  the fasb issued guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income 
this guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity 
the guidance allows two presentation alternatives to present items of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement  or in two separate  but consecutive  statements of net income and other comprehensive income 
this guidance is effective as of the beginning of a fiscal year that begins after december  early adoption is permitted  but full retrospective application is required 
we are evaluating which alternative we will choose upon adoption 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk associated with fluctuations in interest rates  primarily limited to the carrols llc and fiesta restaurant group senior secured credit facilities 
at january   there were million of outstanding term loan borrowings and million of outstanding revolving credit borrowings under the carrols llc senior secured credit facility 
borrowings under the carrols llc senior secured credit facility bear interest at a per annum rate  at our option  of the alternate base rate plus the applicable margin of to based on carrols llc s adjusted leverage ratio with an initial applicable margin set at until the delivery of financial statements for the fourth fiscal quarter of to the agent and lenders under the carrols llc senior secured credit facility  or the libor rate plus the applicable margin of to based on carrols llc s adjusted leverage ratio with an initial applicable margin set at until the delivery of financial statements for the fourth fiscal quarter of to the agent and lenders under the carrols llc senior secured credit facility 
carrols llc interest rate swap agreement 
as required by the carrols llc senior secured credit facility  in november of carrols llc entered into an interest rate swap agreement with its lenders to mitigate the risk of increases in the variable interest rate related to term loan borrowings under the carrols llc senior secured credit facility 
the interest rate swap has been designated as a cash flow hedge 
the interest rate swap fixes the interest rate on of the outstanding term loan borrowings under the carrols llc senior secured credit facility at plus the credit margin on the debt 
the agreement matures on november  and has a notional amount of  at december  the differences between the variable libor rate and the interest rate swap rate of are settled monthly 
a change in interest rates would have resulted in an increase or decrease in interest expense of approximately million for the year ended december  
table of contents commodity price risk we purchase certain products which are affected by commodity prices and are  therefore  subject to price volatility caused by weather  market conditions and other factors which are not considered predictable or within our control 
although many of the products purchased are subject to changes in commodity prices  certain purchasing contracts or pricing arrangements have been negotiated in advance to minimize price volatility 
where possible  we use these types of purchasing techniques to control costs as an alternative to using financial instruments to hedge commodity prices 
in many cases  we believe we will be able to address commodity cost increases that are significant and appear to be long term in nature by adjusting our menu pricing 
however  long term increases in commodity prices may result in lower restaurant level operating margins
