overview cytori therapeutics  inc is developing cell therapies based on autologous adipose derived stem and regenerative cells adrcs to treat cardiovascular disease and repair soft tissue defects 
our scientific data suggest adrcs improve blood flow  moderate the immune response and keep tissue at risk of dying alive 
as a result  we believe these cells can be applied across multiple ischemic conditions 
these therapies are made available by our proprietary device  the celution system  which automates the extraction and preparation of clinical grade adrcs at the point of care 
our goal is to build shareholder value by focusing on novel  high value cell based therapeutics to market in core geographies europe  asia  and the americas 
celution is a platform technology that we believe could potentially address multiple diseases and conditions 
to take advantage of our limited resources  we are committing our internal resources to cardiovascular disease and soft tissue defect repair  offering the technology to customers and or partners to identify and explore additional potential indications  and are seeking partners to accelerate core or non core opportunities 
pipeline the primary therapeutic area within our clinical development pipeline is cardiovascular disease 
we have completed and reported results from three clinical trials  moved from apollo to advance in europe for heart attacks  have been approved to initiate a feasibility trial in the us for chronic myocardial ischemia  and are seeking approval in europe for chronic myocardial ischemia 
in the us  we received approval to begin our athena feasibility trial in chronic myocardial ischemia  which will be a prospective  double blind  placebo controlled  multi center trial in up to patients 
enrollment is expected to begin in the second quarter of and be completed within to months 
in our advance trial  we are amending our european clinical protocol to conform to the evolving country specific regulatory policies for good manufacturing practices for the control of the cell output from our technology 
in aggregate  these protocol amendments should help harmonize the current country to country requirements for cell processing and accelerate country approvals  which has been the rate limiting step in site initiation 
in the meantime  we have already qualified sites with an emphasis on sites in the european g we have been in discussions with the leading eu competent authorities and we expect to have a revised timeline for the trial by the end of the second quarter of 
table of contents our ce mark application for the celution system in no option chronic myocardial ischemia patients is currently under review by our notified body 
barring delays or requests for further data  we anticipate a decision in the first half of should we receive approval  we would target select hospital customers in the g countries and likely implement a patient registry 
this registry will allow us to collect further data to support reimbursement and government payors  and help expand market access 
commercial business the goals for our commercial business are twofold 
the first is to expand market access so that we can grow product revenue significantly over time and the second is to achieve a positive contribution margin in the near term 
today  our sales activities remain largely opportunistic and focused on obtaining and maintaining successful early clinical adopters of our products 
looking forward  we intend to target larger market segments and grow therapeutically oriented consumable revenue 
to accomplish this goal  we are focusing on driving essential market access elements such as published clinical and health economics data  physician education and indication specific therapeutic claims  while maintaining a critical eye on expenses 
in late  cytori reduced its sales and marketing headcount 
the impact of this reduction along with other sales and marketing costs will result in reduced overall spend in  while maintaining our ability to achieve growth objectives 
our most advanced therapeutic indication is breast reconstruction 
in europe  the nhs national innovation centre in the uk indicated that our technology may be cost effective for lumpectomy breast reconstruction 
furthermore  the use of adrcs was acknowledged by the british association of plastic  reconstructive aesthetic surgeons bpras in their latest breast surgery guidelines  demonstrating progress in developing market access 
in  we intend to seek a technology assessment in the uk specific to our celution system for the restore procedure as a way to both improve healthcare and lower the overall costs for women with breast cancer  which will help support our reimbursement efforts in the uk 
in a similar fashion to the uk  we are working with other key competent authorities in europe to expand coverage 
in japan  we are working with the pharmaceuticals and medical devices agency pmda  to leverage our global clinical data for japanese approval of our technology for breast reconstruction 
in other geographic markets  we intend to grow product sales where we are approved to sell 
corporate our corporate priorities are to expand global regulatory approvals  complete strategic development and commercialization partnerships  strengthen the balance sheet and efficiently manage expenses 
one of our top priorities is to establish a strategic partnership  which could accelerate core or non core opportunities and potentially bring in significant minimally or non dilutive capital 
completing one or more substantive partnerships is achievable this year 
due to the platform nature of our technology and products  we are able to simultaneously pursue transactions for multiple indications in core areas like cardiovascular disease and other non core areas such as liver disease for which astellas pharma has negotiation rights 
we have been actively streamlining our operations and reducing costs wherever possible  focusing the company and minimizing cash operating costs 
our budget calls for a reduction of approximately million in combined sales marketing and general and administrative expenses for as compared to this will support an estimated million anticipated increase in r d expenses for  principally to fund our cardiac cell therapy clinical trials 
regulatory processes are well underway in the us  canada  the eu  australia  japan  russia and other countries 
we expect progress in many of these markets during that could expand our commercial opportunities 
in the us  receiving the ide approval was a key development for the company that signals a positive and clearer pathway with the fda 
we also feel that the multiple opportunities we have in other countries increase the possibility that one or more meaningful markets could open up for cytori 
two countries of note where we have made recent progress include australia and india 
we will provide greater detail on these markets as these opportunities mature and grow 

table of contents olympus partnership on november   we entered into a strategic development and manufacturing joint venture agreement and other related agreements with olympus 
as part of the terms of these agreements  we formed a joint venture  olympus cytori  inc joint venture  to develop and manufacture future generation devices based on our celution system platform 
under the joint venture agreements olympus paid  for its interest in the joint venture 
moreover  olympus simultaneously entered into a license joint development agreement with the joint venture and us to develop a second generation commercial system and manufacturing capabilities 
we licensed our device technology  including the celution system platform and certain related intellectual property  to the joint venture for use in future generation devices 
these devices will process and purify adult stem and regenerative cells residing in adipose fat tissue for various therapeutic clinical applications 
in exchange for this license  we received a interest in the joint venture  as well as an initial  payment from the joint venture  the source of this payment was the  contributed to the joint venture by olympus 
moreover  upon receipt of a ce mark for the first generation celution system platform in january  we received an additional  development milestone payment from the joint venture 
the joint venture currently has exclusive access to our celution system device technology for the development  manufacture  and supply of such systems to us 
once a second generation celution system is developed and approved by regulatory agencies  the joint venture will exclusively supply us with these systems at a formula based transfer price 
we have retained all marketing rights subject to our various distribution agreements and regulatory rights to sell the celution system devices for all therapeutic applications of adipose stem and regenerative cells 
we have worked closely with olympus team of scientists and engineers to design the future generations of the celution system so that it will contain certain product enhancements and that can be manufactured in a streamlined manner 
in august  we entered into a license and royalty agreement with the joint venture which provides us the ability to commercially launch the celution system platform earlier than we could have otherwise done so under the terms of the joint venture agreements 
subsequently  in november  we amended the license commercial agreement to substantially incorporate the terms of the royalty agreement effective on the expiration of the royalty agreement to continue to allow us to manufacture the cytori developed celution system platform  including the celution crs  until such time as the joint venture s products are commercially available for the same market served by the cytori platform  subject to a reasonable royalty that will be payable to the joint venture for all such sales 
other related party transactions on february   we agreed to sell  shares of unregistered common stock to green hospital supply  inc for  cash  or per share  in a private stock placement 
on february   we closed the first half of the private placement with green hospital supply  inc and received  we closed the second half of the private placement on april  and received the second payment of in august  we received an additional  from olympus in a private placement of  unregistered shares of our common stock and a warrant to purchase an additional  shares of our common stock at an original exercise price of per share 
the purchase price was per unit with each unit consisting of one share and warrant coverage 
the warrant is exercisable anytime after february  and will expire on august  
table of contents results of operations product revenues product revenues consisted of revenues primarily from our celution and puregraft systems and stemsource cell banks 
the following table summarizes the components for the years ended december    and years ended related party third party total product revenues attributable to olympus attributable to green hospital supply beginning in march of  we began sales and shipments of our celution crs system to the european and asia pacific reconstructive surgery markets and during we began sales of our puregraft system in the united states and europe 
assuming all other applicable revenue recognition criteria have been met  revenue for these product sales is recognized upon delivery to the customer  as all risks and rewards of ownership have been substantively transferred to the customer at that point 
for product sales to customers who arrange for and manage all aspects of the shipping process  we recognize revenue upon shipment from our facilities 
beginning in  for product sales that include a combination of equipment  services  or other multiple deliverables that will be provided in the future  we defer an estimate based on relative selling price method for those future deliverables from product revenue until such deliverables have been provided or earned 
shipping and handling costs that are billed to our customers are classified as revenue 
our product sales in the current year were significantly impacted by the major earthquake  tsunami and the aftermath that occurred in japan in march 
a significant portion of our customer base is located in japan and thus the natural disaster affected our sales during the year ended december  the future we expect to continue to generate product revenues from a mix of celution and stemsource system and consumables sales as well as puregraft orders 
we will sell the products to a diverse group of customers in europe  asia and the us  who may apply the products towards reconstructive surgery  soft tissue repair  research  aesthetics  and cell and tissue banking 
it is anticipated sales in japan will improve as the country continues to recover from the natural disaster in march cost of product revenues cost of product revenues relate primarily to celution system products and stemsource cell banks and includes material  manufacturing labor  and overhead costs 
the following table summarizes the components of our cost of revenues for the years ended december   and years ended cost of product revenues share based compensation total cost of product revenues total cost of product revenues as of product revenues 
table of contents cost of product revenues as a percentage of product revenues was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
fluctuation in this percentage is to be expected due to the product mix as well as mix of distributor and direct sales comprising the revenue for the period 
the future 
we expect to continue to see variation in our gross profit margin as the product mix comprising revenues fluctuates 
development revenues the following table summarizes the components of our development revenues for the years ended december   and years ended milestone revenue olympus research grant nih grant revenue regenerative cell storage services other total development revenues we recognize deferred revenues  related party  as development revenue when certain performance obligations are met ie  using a proportional performance approach 
during the year ended december   we recognized  of revenue associated with our arrangements with olympus as a result of achieving a product development and a regulatory milestone related to the preproduction development of the next generation celution one system 
during the year ended december   we recognized  of revenue associated with our arrangements with olympus as a result of achieving two milestones  one in product development  and one clinical milestone related to the assessment of trial outcomes at months in one of our cardiac trials 
during the year ended december   we recognized  of revenue associated with our arrangement with olympus as a result of achieving three clinical milestones during the year  which reflected the achievement of the primary goals of safety and feasibility  the completion of the enrollment process for both of our clinical cardiac trials  and completion of a monitoring end point for one cardiac trial 
the research grant revenue related to our agreement with the national institutes of health nih 
under this arrangement  the nih reimbursed us for qualifying expenditures related to research on adipose tissue derived cells for vascular cell therapy 
to receive funds under the grant arrangement  we were required to i demonstrate that we incurred qualifying expenses  as defined in the grant agreement between the nih and us  ii maintain a system of controls  whereby we can accurately track and report all expenditures related solely to research on adipose tissue derived cells for vascular cell therapy  and iii file appropriate forms and follow appropriate protocols established by the nih 
during the year ended december   we incurred  in qualified expenditures 
we recognized a total of  in revenues for the year ended december   which included allowable grant fees as well as cost reimbursements 
there were no comparable revenues and expenditures for the year ended december  and during the year ended december   we received a  federal grant from the internal revenue service as part of the qualifying therapeutic discovery program qtdp 
the qtdp  administered by the department of health and human services and the department of the treasury  was enacted to encourage biomedical research for projects that show the greatest potential to create and sustain high quality  high paying us jobs and to advance us competitiveness in life  biological and medical sciences 
through this program  eligible companies can elect to receive either a cash grant or a tax credit 
we elected to receive a cash grant and the funds were received during late the future we may recognize additional development revenues during  as the anticipated completion for the next milestone of our joint venture and other olympus performance obligations is in the exact timing of whether additional development revenue will be recognized and when amounts will be reported in revenue will depend on internal factors for instance  our ability to complete certain contributions and obligations that we have agreed to perform as well as external considerations  including obtaining certain regulatory clearances and or approvals related to the celution system 
however  the cash for these contributions and obligations was received by us when the joint venture agreement was signed and no further related cash payments will be made to us even if we recognize additional development revenue related to olympus 
to date under the contract  of the  originally deferred  we have recognized a total of  through december  
table of contents we will continue to recognize revenue from the thin film development work we are performing on behalf of senko  based on the relative fair value of the milestones completed as compared to the total efforts expected to be necessary to obtain regulatory clearance from the mhlw 
we are still awaiting regulatory clearance from the mhlw in order for initial commercialization to occur 
accordingly  we expect to recognize approximately  consisting of  in deferred revenues plus a non refundable payment of  to be received upon commercialization in revenues associated with this milestone arrangement if and when regulatory approval is achieved 
moreover  we expect to recognize  per year associated with deferred senko license fees over a three year period following commercialization  if achieved  as the refund rights associated with the license payment expire 
there can be no assurance given of whether  or when  this regulatory approval might be received to allow us to proceed with commercialization 
research and development expenses research and development expenses include costs associated with the design  development  testing and enhancement of our products  regulatory fees  the purchase of laboratory supplies  pre clinical studies and clinical studies 
the following table summarizes the components of our research and development expenses for the years ended december   and years ended research and development development milestone joint venture research grants nih stock based compensation total research and development expenses research and development expenses relate to the development of a technology platform that involves using adipose tissue as a source of autologous regenerative cells for therapeutic applications 
these expenses  in conjunction with continued development efforts related to our celution system  result primarily from the broad expansion of our research and development efforts enabled by the funding we received from olympus in and and from other investors during the last few years 
the increase in research and development expenses for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in is primarily due to the increase in salary and related benefits expense excluding share based compensation of  due to increase in headcount in our research and development departments 
the decrease in research and development expenses for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in is primarily due to the decrease in clinical and preclinical study expense of  and decrease in supplies related expense of  primarily due to the decreased research and development experiment supplies usage as well as supplies purchased for prototype work prior to the related product commercialization 
expenditures related to the joint venture with olympus  which are included in the variation analysis above  include costs that are necessary to support the commercialization of future generation devices  including the next generation celution system 
these development activities  which began in november  include performing pre clinical and clinical studies  seeking regulatory approval  and performing product development related to therapeutic applications for adipose stem and regenerative cells for multiple large markets 
the costs associated with the development of the device were comprised of labor and related benefits  consulting and other professional services  supplies and other miscellaneous expenses 
the future we expect research and development expenditures to increase in as we are scheduled to continue enrollment in the advance cardiac trial  start enrollment in our us trial athena and seek additional regulatory clearances and potentially seek to initiate additional trials or patient registries during

the future 
we expect sales and marketing expenditures to decrease in based on targeted reductions in staff and external costs made prior to year end in and subsequent reductions made in early general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses include costs for administrative personnel  legal and other professional expenses  and general corporate expenses 
the following table summarizes the general and administrative expenses for the years ended december   and years ended general and administrative stock based compensation total general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in  the increase in general and administrative expenses excluding share based compensation occurred primarily due to an increase in professional services expense of  related mostly to legal costs incurred in connection with european patent validations and maintenance of the worldwide patent estate 
for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in  the increase in general and administrative expenses excluding share based compensation occurred primarily due to an increase in salary and related benefits expense of  and an increase in professional services expense of  primarily related to corporate strategic consulting

additionally  throughout  we issued to our new hires and to employees being promoted options to purchase an aggregate of up to  shares of our common stock with four year vesting for our officers and employees and two year vesting for our directors 
we granted  performance based restricted stock awards under the equity incentive plan in february the awards provide certain employees until january  to achieve certain performance goals established by the compensation committee 
the performance goals are weighted based on the following achievements obtaining certain fda clearance or approval  achieving a targeted revenue increase for the fiscal year ended december   and entering into a major collaboration for development and or commercialization of the company s products 
to the extent that any of the performance goals are partially achieved  the compensation committee maintains the discretion to continue the vesting of all or a portion of the awards following january  once earned  the awards will remain unvested until january  termination of employment prior to vesting will result in the forfeiture of any earned as well as unearned awards 
effective january  the outstanding awards ceased vesting based upon decision of compensation committee that performance criteria has not been met as of january  no compensation expense was recognized related to these awards during the year ended december  the following table summarizes activity with respect to such awards during the year ended december  options weighted average grant date fair value outstanding at january  granted vested cancelled forfeited outstanding at december  vested at december

change in fair value of warrant liability the following is a table summarizing the change in fair value of warrant liability for the years ended december   and years ended december  change in fair value of warrant liability effective january   we changed our method of accounting for certain common stock purchase warrants with exercise price reset features due to the adoption of a new accounting standard 
these warrants were issued in connection with our august private placement of  unregistered shares of common stock and  common stock warrants 
the warrants had an original exercise price of and expire in august under the new standard  these warrants previously recognized in stockholders equity deficit are now accounted for as fair value liabilities  with changes in fair value included in net earnings loss 
the cumulative effect of the adoption is to present these warrants as liabilities on the date of the adoption as if they had been accounted for as liabilities since the warrants were issued 
as a result on january   we recognized a million long term warrant liability  a million decrease in accumulated deficit and a corresponding decrease in additional paid in capital of million 
the fair value of these warrants increased to million as of december   as a result of a million loss from the change in fair value of warrants for the year then ended 
the fair value of these warrants decreased to million as of december   as a result of a million gain from the change in fair value of warrants for the year then ended 
the fair value of these warrants decreased to million as of december   as a result of a million gain from the change in fair value of warrants for the year then ended 

table of contents since these warrants do not qualify for hedge accounting  all future changes in the fair value of the warrants will be recognized currently in earnings until such time as the warrants are exercised or expire 
these warrants are not traded in an active securities market  and as such  we estimated the fair value of these warrants using option pricing model using the following assumptions as of december  as of december  expected term years years common stock market price risk free interest rate expected volatility resulting fair value per warrant expected volatility is based primarily on historical volatility 
historical volatility was computed using daily pricing observations for recent periods that correspond to the expected term of the warrants 
we believe this method produces an estimate that is representative of our expectations of future volatility over the expected term of these warrants 
we currently have no reason to believe future volatility over the expected remaining life of these warrants is likely to differ materially from historical volatility 
the expected life is based on the remaining term of the warrants 
the risk free interest rate is the interest rate for treasury constant maturity instruments published by the federal reserve board that is closest to the expected term of the warrants 
the fair value of these warrants also incorporates our assumptions about future equity issuances and their impact to the down round protection feature 
the future 
future changes in the fair value of the warrant liability will be recognized currently in earnings until such time as the warrants are exercised or expire 
change in fair value of option liability the following is a table summarizing the change in fair value of option liability for the years ended december   and years ended change in fair value of option liability in reference to the joint venture  the shareholders agreement between cytori and olympus provides that in certain specified circumstances of insolvency or if we experience a change in control  olympus will have the right to i repurchase our interests in the joint venture at the fair value of such interests or ii sell its own interests in the joint venture to us at the higher of a  or b the put s fair value 
the put has been classified as a liability 
the valuations of the put were completed using an option pricing theory based simulation analysis ie  a monte carlo simulation 
the valuations are based on assumptions as of the valuation date with regard to the market value of cytori and the estimated fair value of the joint venture  the expected correlation between the values of cytori and the joint venture  the expected volatility of cytori and the joint venture  the bankruptcy recovery rate for cytori  the bankruptcy threshold for cytori  the probability of a change of control event for cytori  and the risk free interest rate

financing items the following table summarizes interest income  interest expense  and other income and expenses for the years ended december   and years ended interest income interest expense other income expense  net total interest income remained comparable for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in interest income decreased for the year december  as compared to the same period in and primarily due to a decrease in interest rates 
interest expense increased for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in due to cash interest and non cash amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discount for our million term loan 
in september  we entered into a second amendment to the amended and restated loan and security agreement  pursuant to which the lenders funded an additional principal increasing the total principal balance to million 
interest expense increased in as compared to due to cash interest and non cash amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discount for the million term loan 
during the second quarter of  we entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement  pursuant to which the lenders funded a term loan in the amount of million on june   and which refinanced the remaining balance of the term loan from the changes in other income expense in  and resulted primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the future 
interest income earned in will be dependent on our levels of funds available for investment as well as general economic conditions 
subject to our future financing activities  we expect interest expense in to increase as we continue to pay interest on the million term loan that funded in september equity loss from investment in joint venture the following table summarizes equity loss from investment in joint venture for the years ended december   and years ended equity loss from investment in joint venture the losses relate entirely to our equity interest in the joint venture  which we account for using the equity method of accounting 
the future 
we do not expect to recognize significant losses from the activities of the joint venture in the foreseeable future 
over the next one to two years  the joint venture is expected to incur labor costs related to the development of our second generation commercial system as well as general and administrative expenses  offset by royalty and product revenue expected to be generated by our current celution crs and future generation devices 
though we have no obligation to do so  we plan to contribute funding to the joint venture to cover any costs should the joint venture deplete its cash balance 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources short term and long term liquidity the following is a summary of our key liquidity measures at december  and as of december  cash and cash equivalents current assets current liabilities working capital we incurred net losses of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we have an accumulated deficit of  as of december  additionally  we have used net cash of   and  to fund our operating activities for years ended december   and  respectively 
to date these operating losses have been funded primarily from outside sources of invested capital 
management recognizes the need to generate positive cash flows in future periods and or to obtain additional capital from various sources 
in the continued absence of positive cash flows from operations  no assurance can be given that we can generate sufficient revenue to cover operating costs or that additional financing will be available to us and  if available  on terms acceptable to us in the future 
during and  we expanded our commercialization activities while simultaneously pursuing available financing sources to support operations and growth 
we have had  and will likely continue to have  an ongoing need to raise additional cash from outside sources to fund our operations for and beyond 
if we cannot do so when required  we would need to reduce our research  development  and administrative operations  including reductions of our employee base  in order to offset lack of available funding 
we continue to evaluate available strategic and financing opportunities as part of our normal course of business 
from january  to december   we have financed our operations primarily by receiving approximately  in gross proceeds from sale to institutional investors of a total of  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase up to a total of  additional shares of our common stock with an exercise price of per share in march  receiving approximately  in gross proceeds from a private placement of  unregistered shares of common stock and  common stock warrants with an exercise price of per share to a syndicate of investors in may  in june  we entered into a common stock purchase agreement with seaside  lp relating to the offering and sale of a total of up to  shares of our common stock

while our estimates are based on assumptions we consider reasonable at the time they were made  our actual results may differ from our estimates  perhaps significantly 
if results differ materially from our estimates  we will make adjustments to our financial statements prospectively as we become aware of the necessity for an adjustment 

table of contents we believe it is important for you to understand our most critical accounting policies 
these are our policies that require us to make our most significant judgments and  as a result  could have the greatest impact on our future financial results 
warrant liability effective january   we changed our method of accounting for certain common stock purchase warrants with exercise price reset features due to the adoption of a new accounting standard 
these warrants were issued in connection with our august private placement of  unregistered shares of common stock and  common stock warrants 
the warrants had an original exercise price of and expire in august under the new standard  these warrants previously recognized in stockholders equity deficit are now accounted for as fair value liabilities  with changes in fair value included in net earnings loss 
the fair value of these warrants decreased to million as of december   as a result of a million gain from the change in fair value of warrants for the year then ended 
the fair value of these warrants decreased to million as of december   as a result of a million gain from the change in fair value of warrants for the year then ended 
since these warrants do not qualify for hedge accounting  all future changes in the fair value of the warrants will be recognized currently in earnings until such time as the warrants are exercised or expire 
these warrants are not traded in an active securities market  and as such  we estimated the fair value of these warrants using an option pricing model 
the significant drivers of the increase decrease are related to changes in stock price and potential future stock issuances 
expected volatility is based primarily on historical volatility 
historical volatility was computed using daily pricing observations for recent periods that correspond to the expected term of the warrants 
we believe this method produces an estimate that is representative of our expectations of future volatility over the expected term of these warrants 
we currently have no reason to believe future volatility over the expected remaining life of these warrants is likely to differ materially from historical volatility 
the expected life is based on the remaining term of the warrants 
the risk free interest rate is the interest rate for treasury constant maturity instruments published by the federal reserve board that is closest to the expected term of the warrants 
the fair value of these warrants also incorporates our assumptions about future equity issuances and their impact to the down round protection feature 
revenue recognition product sales we recognize revenue from product sales when the following fundamental criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the price to the customer is fixed or determinable and iv collection of the resulting accounts receivable is reasonably assured 
for all sales  we use a binding purchase order or a signed agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
revenue for these product sales is recognized upon delivery to the customer  as all risks and rewards of ownership have been substantively transferred to the customer at that point 
for sales to customers who arrange for and manage the shipping process  we recognize revenue upon shipment from our facilities 
shipping and handling costs that are billed to our customers are classified as revenue 
the customer s obligation to pay and the payment terms are set at the time of delivery and are not dependent on the subsequent use or resale of our products 
beginning in  for sales that include multiple deliverables  such as sales of our stemsource cell bank cell bank  we account for products or services deliverables separately rather than as a combined unit 
stem cell banks typically consist of a complex array of equipment and proprietary knowledge  and services  including one or more stemsource devices  a cryogenic freezer  measuring and monitoring equipment  and a database patient tracking system 
in addition  we typically provide consulting services  installation and training services concurrent with the installation of the cell bank 
web hosting and technical and maintenance services are generally provided for a period of up to one year subsequent to the date of sale 
the fasb guidance of the codification establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable  which is based on a vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  b third party evidence tpe  or c management estimates 
this guidance also eliminates the residual method of allocation and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
for our cell bank sales  we establish relative selling prices for all deliverables based on vendor specific quotes for comparable services when available 
in the absence of vsoe  we use competitor s products or services considered largely interchangeable with our own or management best estimate 
a substantial amount of consulting services are provided to customers before the equipment installation and training has been completed  and therefore we treat this as a separate unit of accounting 
the equipment with installation and initial training activities are treated as separate units of accounting 
also of standalone value to customers is the transfer of the proprietary knowledge  most notably in the form of standard operating procedures  and any license or exclusivity rights associated with the agreements 
revenue for the various deliverables is calculated and recognized based on the relative selling prices of each deliverable 
future services such as web hosting and ongoing maintenance are deferred and recognized into income during the year following the installation 
there would have been no material impact to our financial statements in had we applied this guidance retrospectively 

table of contents concentration of significant customers for the year ended december   our sales were concentrated with respect to one direct customer  which comprised of our product revenue recognized for the year ended december  our asia pacific and north america region sales accounted for of our product revenue recognized for the year ended december  additionally  two direct customers accounted for of total outstanding accounts receivable as of december  our asia pacific and north america region sales accounted for of our product revenue recognized for the year ended december  additionally  two customers accounted for of total outstanding accounts receivable as of december  research and development we received funds from olympus and olympus cytori  inc during and we recorded upfront fees totaling  as deferred revenues  related party 
in exchange for these proceeds  we agreed to a provide olympus cytori  inc an exclusive and perpetual license to our celution system device technology and certain related intellectual property  and b provide future development contributions related to commercializing the celution system platform 
the license and development services are not separable and as a result the recognition of this deferred amount requires achievement of service related milestones  under a proportional performance methodology 
if and as such revenues are recognized  deferred revenue will be decreased 
proportional performance methodology was elected due to the nature of our development obligations and efforts in support of the joint venture jv  including product development activities and regulatory efforts to support the commercialization of the jv products 
the application of this methodology uses the achievement of r d milestones as outputs of value to the jv 
we received up front  non refundable payments in connection with these development obligations  which we have broken down into specific r d milestones that are definable and substantive in nature  and which will result in value to the jv when achieved 
as our research and development efforts progress  we periodically evaluate  and modify if necessary  the milestone points in our proportional performance model to ensure that revenue recognition accurately reflects our best estimate of substantive value deliverable to the jv 
revenue will be recognized as the above mentioned r d milestones are completed 
of the amounts received and deferred  we recognized development revenues of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
all related development costs are expensed as incurred and are included in research and development expense on our statements of operations 
to date under the contract  of the  originally deferred  we have recognized a total of  through december  see notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein for disclosure and a discussion of critical accounting policies and significant estimates 
recent accounting pronouncements see notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein for disclosure and discussion of new accounting standards 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in interest rates and in foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate exposure we are not subject to market risk due to fluctuations in interest rates on our long term obligations as they bear a fixed rate of interest 
our exposure relates primarily to short term investments  including funds classified as cash equivalents 
as of december   all excess funds were invested in money market funds and other highly liquid investments  therefore our interest rate exposure is not considered to be material 

table of contents foreign currency exchange rate exposure our exposure to market risk due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our activities in europe and japan 
transaction gains or losses resulting from cash balances and revenues have not been significant in the past and we are not engaged in any hedging activity in the euro  the yen or other currencies 
based on our cash balances and revenues derived from markets other than the united states for the year ended december   a hypothetical adverse change in the euro or yen against the us dollar would not result in a material foreign currency exchange loss 
consequently  we do not expect that reductions in the value of such sales denominated in foreign currencies resulting from even a sudden or significant fluctuation in foreign exchange rates would have a direct material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
notwithstanding the foregoing  the indirect effect of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for example  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may affect international demand for our products 
in addition  interest rate fluctuations may affect our customers buying patterns 
furthermore  interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations may broadly influence the united states and foreign economies resulting in a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
under our japanese thin film agreement with senko  we would receive payments in the nature of royalties based on senko s net sales  which would be yen denominated
