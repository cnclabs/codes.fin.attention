item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
our investment balances at each of the last three fiscal year ends are as follows november  november  november  fortress alternative asset fund at other marketable securities licensee store real estate ihfc zenith recorded in other long term assets the alternative asset fund the fund was organized under the delaware revised uniform limited partnership act and commenced operations on july  the objective of the fund was to achieve consistent positive returns  while attempting to reduce risk and volatility  by placing our capital with a variety of hedge funds and experienced portfolio managers 
such hedge funds and portfolio managers employed a variety of trading styles or strategies  including  but not limited to  convertible arbitrage  merger or risk arbitrage  distressed debt  long short equity  multi strategy and other market neutral strategies 
in  we requested that our general partner begin to liquidate all of our investments in the fund 
during fiscal and  we received and  respectively  for liquidations associated with various investments in the fund 
as of november   the fund held only a investment in fortress formerly the db zwirn special opportunities fund  lp  along with some remaining cash which was distributed in early due to the level of the remaining assets in the fund  the company and private advisors  llc dissolved the partnership effective december  and the fund s remaining investment interest in fortress was transferred to the company 
our marketable securities portfolio consists of bond mutual funds and fixed income securities with maturities that range from one to twenty years 
historically  our marketable securities have been held by two different money managers and consisted of a combination of equity and fixed income securities  including money market funds 
during the second quarter of  we liquidated our equity holdings with one of the managers and reinvested the proceeds in various money market funds  individual bonds and bond funds 
during the first quarter of  we liquidated the equity holdings with the other manager and reinvested those funds in money market accounts 
as part of our retail strategy  we invest in retail store property that is either used by our company owned stores or leased to our licensees 
licensee store real estate is presented as an other long term asset in our consolidated balance sheet 
these real estate holdings are typically in urban  high traffic retail locations 
trademarks and patents our trademarks  including bassett and the names of our marketing divisions  products and collections  are significant to the conduct of our business 
this is important due to consumer recognition of the names and identification with our broad range of products 
certain of our trademarks are licensed to independent retailers for use in full store and store gallery presentations of our products 
we also own copyrights that are important in the conduct of our business 
research and development the furniture industry is considered to be a fashion industry subject to constant fluctuations to meet changing consumer preferences and tastes 
as such  we are continuously involved in the development of new designs and products 
due to the nature of these efforts and the close relationship to the manufacturing operations  these costs are considered normal operating costs and are not segregated 
we are not otherwise involved in traditional research and development activities nor do we sponsor the research and development activities of any of our customers 
government regulations we believe that we have materially complied with all federal  state and local standards in the areas of safety  health and pollution and environmental controls 
we are involved in environmental matters at certain of our plant facilities  which arise in the normal course of business 
although the final outcome of these environmental matters cannot be determined  based on the present facts  we do not believe that the final resolution of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or future results of operations 
we may also be affected by laws and regulations of countries from which we source goods 
labor  environmental  and other laws and regulations change over time  especially in the developing countries from which we source 
changes in these areas of regulation could negatively impact the cost and availability of sourced goods 
the timing and extent to which these regulations could have an adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations is difficult to predict 
based on the present facts  we do not believe that they will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or future results of operations 
people we employed  people as of november   of which were employed in our retail segment and were employed in our wholesale segment 
none of our employees are subject to collective bargaining arrangements and we have not experienced any recent work stoppages 
we consider our relationship with our employees to be good 
foreign and domestic operations and export sales we have no foreign manufacturing or retail operations 
we define export sales as sales to any country or territory other than the united states or its territories or possessions 
our export sales were approximately   and  in   and  respectively 
at november   we had  of our finished goods inventory physically warehoused in vietnam and china

item a 
risk factors the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward looking information contained in this annual report on form k 
the risk factors below represent what we believe are the known material risk factors with respect to us and our business 
any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business  operations  industry  financial position or future financial results 
we face a difficult current retail environment and changing economic conditions that may further adversely affect consumer demand and spending 
many industry analysts believe the current home furnishings environment is as difficult as the industry has ever experienced 
historically  the home furnishings industry has been subject to cyclical variations in the general economy and to uncertainty regarding future economic prospects 
this historical uncertainty  combined with general economic uncertainty due to lagging consumer confidence and rising unemployment  may continue to cause inconsistent and unpredictable consumer spending habits 
should consumer demand for home furnishings further deteriorate  it could adversely affect our business through its impact on the performance of our company owned stores as well as our licensees and the ability of a number of them to meet their obligations to us 
competition from domestic and overseas manufacturers continues to increase and may adversely affect our business  operating results or financial condition 
our wholesale business segment is involved in the development of our brand  which encompasses the design  manufacture  sourcing  sales and distribution of our home furnishings products  and competes with other us and foreign manufacturers and other wholesalers 
industry globalization and the development of manufacturing capabilities in other countries  particularly within asia  has led to increased competitive pressures brought about by the increasing volume of imported finished goods and components  particularly for case good products 
the increase in overseas production capacity in recent years has created over capacity for many foreign and us manufacturers  including us  which has led to industry wide plant consolidation in the us in addition  because many foreign manufacturers are able to maintain substantially lower production costs  including the cost of labor and overhead  imported product is capable of being sold at a lower price to consumers  which  in turn  has led to additional industry wide price deflation 
our use of foreign sources of production for a substantial portion of our products exposes us to certain additional risks associated with international operations 
our use of foreign sources for the supply of many of our products exposes us to risks associated with overseas sourcing 
these risks are related to government regulation  delays in shipments  and extended lead time in ordering 
governments in the foreign countries where we source our products may change their laws  regulations and policies  including those related to tariffs and trade barriers  investments  taxation and exchange controls which could make it more difficult to service our customers resulting in an adverse effect on our earnings 
shipping delays and extended order lead times may adversely affect our ability to respond to sudden changes in demand  resulting in the purchase of excess inventory in the face of declining demand  or lost sales due to insufficient inventory in the face of increasing demand  either of which would also have an adverse effect on our earnings or liquidity 
our company owned stores may not achieve the anticipated growth and profitability 
our company owned stores currently operate at a loss 
our goal is to operate these stores at a level of modest profitability to enhance operating margins generated by our wholesale operation 
to be successful  we need to increase our sales per store while decreasing the support costs as a percentage of sales 
as part of our strategy  we must hire  train and retain a qualified staff of design consultants to improve the customer experience 
competition with other furniture retailers for qualified design consultants also continues to increase 
we also compete with other retailers for management personnel and appropriate retail locations 
failures and delays in implementing our retail strategies or failure to realize the benefits of these strategies could adversely impact our business and operating results 
our licensee owned stores may not be able to meet their obligations to us 
we have a significant amount of accounts receivable from our network of licensee owned stores 
we also own some of the real estate that is leased to our licensees and guarantee some of the leases of some of our licensees 
if these stores do not generate the necessary level of sales and profits  they may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us resulting in additional bad debt expenses and real estate related losses 
unsuccessful implementation of our new store design  or failure to realize the intended benefits of the new design  may be detrimental to future operating results and financial condition 
in  we unveiled a new store prototype that we believe is critical to our retail success 
utilizing the basic tenants of our new prototype as a guideline  we are in the midst of a visual standardization program that will ultimately permeate our entire fleet of stores 
implementation will occur in stages over the next few years  depending on the availability of capital 
failure to successfully implement the new store design and or the visual standardization program  or to realize the intended benefits thereof  could prove costly and could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition 
failure to successfully anticipate or respond to changes in consumer tastes and trends in a timely manner could adversely impact our business  operating results and financial condition 
sales of our furniture are dependent upon consumer acceptance of our designs  styles  quality and price 
as with all retailers  our business is susceptible to changes in consumer tastes and trends 
we attempt to monitor changes in consumer tastes and home design trends through attendance at international industry events and fashion shows  internal marketing research  and communication with our retailers and design consultants who provide valuable input on consumer tendencies 
however  such tastes and trends can change rapidly and any delay or failure to anticipate or respond to changing consumer tastes and trends in a timely manner could adversely impact our business  operating results and financial condition 
our success depends upon our brand  marketing and advertising efforts and pricing strategies  and if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand  or if we are not successful in these efforts and strategies  our business and operating results could be adversely affected 
maintaining and enhancing our brand is critical to our ability to expand our base of customers and drive increased traffic at both company owned and licensee owned stores 
our advertising and marketing campaign utilizes television  direct mail  catalogs  newspapers  magazines  radio and the internet in an effort to maintain and enhance our existing brand equity 
we cannot provide assurance that our marketing  advertising and other efforts to promote and maintain awareness of our brand will not require us to incur substantial costs 
if these efforts are unsuccessful or we incur substantial costs in connection with these efforts  our business  operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
manufacturing realignments could result in a decrease in our near term earnings 
we regularly review and evaluate our domestic manufacturing operations and offshore import sourcing capabilities 
as a result  we sometimes realign those operations and capabilities and institute cost savings programs 
these programs can include the consolidation and integration of facilities  functions  systems and procedures 
we also may shift certain products from domestic manufacturing to offshore sourcing 
these realignments and cost savings programs generally involve some initial cost and can result in decreases in our near term earnings until we achieve the expected cost reductions 
failure to accomplish these actions as quickly as planned  or failure to fully achieve the expected cost reductions  could adversely impact our operating results and financial conditions 
fluctuations in the price  availability and quality of raw materials could result in increased costs or cause production delays which might result in a decline in sales  either of which could adversely impact our earnings 
we use various types of wood  foam  fibers  fabrics  leathers  and other raw materials in manufacturing our furniture 
certain of our raw materials  including fabrics  are purchased both abroad and domestically 
fluctuations in the price  availability and quality of raw materials could result in increased costs or a delay in manufacturing our products  which in turn could result in a delay in delivering products to our customers 
for example  lumber prices fluctuate over time based on factors such as weather and demand  which in turn impact availability 
production delays or upward trends in raw material prices could result in lower sales or margins  thereby adversely impacting our earnings 
in addition  certain suppliers may require extensive advance notice of our requirements in order to produce products in the quantities we desire 
this long lead time may require us to place orders far in advance of the time when certain products will be offered for sale  thereby exposing us to risks relating to shifts in consumer demand and trends  and any further downturn in the us economy

our products are sold primarily through a network of licensee and company owned branded stores under the bassett home furnishings bhf name  with additional distribution through other wholesale channels including multi line furniture stores  many of which feature bassett galleries or design centers  specialty stores and mass merchants 
we were founded in and incorporated under the laws of virginia in our rich year history has instilled the principles of quality  value  and integrity in everything that we do  while simultaneously providing us with the expertise to respond to ever changing consumer tastes and to meet the demands of a global economy 
with bhf stores at november   we have leveraged our strong brand name in furniture into a network of licensed and corporate stores that focus on providing consumers with a friendly environment for buying furniture and accessories 
we created our store program in to provide a single source home furnishings retail store that provides a unique combination of stylish  quality furniture and accessories with a high level of customer service 
the store features custom order furniture ready for delivery in less than days  more than upholstery fabrics  free in home design visits  and coordinated decorating accessories 
we believe that our capabilities in custom furniture have become unmatched in recent years 
our manufacturing team takes great pride in the breadth of its options  the precision of its craftsmanship  and the speed of its delivery 
the selling philosophy in the stores is based on building strong long term relationships with each customer 
sales people are referred to as design consultants and are each trained to evaluate customer needs and provide comprehensive solutions for their home decor 
we continue to strengthen the sales and design talent within our company owned retail stores 
during  our design consultants completed extensive design certification training coursework 
this coursework has strengthened their skills related to our house call and design business  and is intended to increase business with our most valuable customers 
in order to reach markets that cannot be effectively served by our retail store network  we also distribute our products through other wholesale channels including multi line furniture stores  many of which feature bassett galleries or design centers  specialty stores and mass merchants 
we believe this blended strategy provides us the greatest ability to effectively distribute our products throughout the united states and ultimately gain market share 
in september of  we announced the formation of a strategic partnership with hgtv television  a division of scripps networks  llc 
this strategic alliance will combine our year heritage in the furniture industry with the penetration of million households in the united states that hgtv enjoys today 
in  we will begin to market a line of hgtv branded custom upholstery and accent furniture in our bhf network and will also launch a new product range of hgtv furniture collection products that will be sold to key independent retailers across the united states 
our store network included company owned and operated stores and licensee owned stores at november  during  we acquired a total of nine licensee stores and closed seven underperforming company owned stores resulting in charges of and  for asset impairment and lease exit costs  respectively 
we also recorded an additional  in lease exit charges for several previously closed stores due to changes in circumstances affecting our expected ability to partially recover our future lease obligations in those locations 
all of these lease exit costs were incurred prior to our fiscal third quarter of during our second fiscal quarter of  we incurred a charge of  for a cash payment made for the modification of an existing lease of one of our company owned store locations 
in addition to the changes in our company owned stores during  we terminated the bassett license agreement for certain licensees resulting in the closure of six stores 
as a result of these licensee terminations  we incurred loan guarantee charges of during other store closures are possible during that could result in lease exit charges or increases in our lease and loan guarantee reserves 
the following table summarizes the changes in store count during fiscal november  openings closed transfers november  licensee owned stores company owned stores total on december   we opened a new leased store in torrance  california marking our first store opening since april of other than relocating our store in manchester  missouri in the fourth quarter of and increasing our total company owned and operated store count to in february of  we plan to close our store in glen allen  virginia and relocate it to a more desirable location adjacent to the short pump town center mall northwest of richmond  virginia 
we have also signed lease agreements for store space in paramus  new jersey and dallas  texas and expect to open stores in those locations by the end of before signing leases for other new store locations  we currently plan to evaluate the performance of these stores to ensure that investment returns warrant further capital investment in new stores 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we gained significant liquidity as a result of the sale of our investment in ihfc see sale of ihfc below 
this liquidity event has enabled us to become more opportunistic in managing our relationships with our licensees and therefore accelerate certain licensees ability to rebuild their businesses after several years of extremely difficult industry conditions 
as such  we cancelled certain debts of what we consider to be key licensees in select markets 
while the debts cancelled were considered to be collectible over time  we believe that  rather than requiring repayment of these obligations  we will realize a greater long term benefit by the cancellation of these debts 
in exchange for relieving the debts of these licensees and thus strengthening their respective financial positions  we believe these licensees will be in a much better position to reinvest in all aspects of their store operations new product offerings  personnel  advertising  building appeal  etc  which will ultimately lead to increased sales and profitability of the bassett brand 
as a result of this debt cancellation  we incurred a charge in the second quarter of  our wholesale operations include an upholstery plant in newton  north carolina that produces a wide range of upholstered furniture 
we believe that we are an industry leader with our quick ship custom upholstery offerings 
we also operate a custom dining manufacturing facility in martinsville  va 
most of our wood furniture and certain of our upholstery offerings are sourced through several foreign plants  primarily in china and vietnam 
we define imported product as fully finished product that is sourced internationally 
for fiscal  approximately of our wholesale sales were of imported product compared to for fiscal overall conditions for our industry and our company have been difficult over the past several years although we have seen some slight improvement during the last year 
nevertheless  we have continued to face significant economic pressures as new housing starts remain down and consumers continue to be faced with general economic uncertainty fueled by continuing high unemployment  high fuel prices  and financial market volatility 
these conditions have significantly limited the resumption of growth for big ticket consumer purchases such as furniture 
consequently  this has put pressure on certain of our dealers ability to generate adequate profits to fully pay us for the furniture we have sold to them 
as a result  we incurred significant bad debt and notes receivable valuation charges during the past three fiscal years 
for fiscal  and  we recorded   and  respectively  in bad debt and notes receivable valuation charges 
during the second half of  this trend improved significantly as we only incurred bad debt charges of for the six months ended november   reflecting improved credit positions with our current fleet of licensees 
although management will continue to work closely with our licensees to ensure the success of both the licensee and bassett  further store closures are possible 
analysis of operations our fiscal year ends on the saturday closest to november  which periodically results in a week year 
fiscal  and each contained weeks 
net sales  gross profit  selling  general and administrative sg a expense  and operating loss were as follows for the years ended november   november  and november  net sales gross profit sg a bad debt and notes receivable valuation charges unusual charges gains  net loss from operations sales for fiscal were  as compared to  for and  for  representing increases decreases of and  respectively 
this trend primarily reflects the increase in the number of stores owned and operated by us 
our consolidated net sales by segment were as follows wholesale retail inter company elimination consolidated net sales gross margins for fiscal   and were   and  respectively 
the margin increases result primarily from a greater mix of sales being through the retail segment as well as improved margins in both the wholesale and retail segments 
selling  general and administrative expenses  excluding bad debt and notes receivable valuation charges  increased  in as compared to and increased  in as compared to primarily due to the increase in the number of company owned retail stores 
bad debt and notes receivable valuation charges increased  in from levels 
this increase reflects the continued deterioration of certain of our licensees during as a result  we acquired nine stores from four licensees and closed six stores with three other licensees during fiscal bad debt and notes receivable valuation charges decreased by  in from levels as many of the distressed licensee owned stores for which significant bad debt and notes receivable valuation charges were required in were acquired by us the following year 
our operating loss in is primarily due to continued elevated bad debt charges in our wholesale segment  operating losses incurred by our retail segment and various restructuring and unusual charges net of unusual gains 
these retail operating losses reflect the continuing weakness in the home furnishings retail environment  the shortfall between the amount of sales required to breakeven on an average per store basis and the amount of sales that were actually written and delivered  and costs associated with the acquisition and stabilization of distressed licensee stores 
however  in the last half of we did see a significant reduction in the amount of bad debt charges taken at the wholesale level  and we have begun to see slight improvement in the retail environment 
we continue to take actions to improve per store sales performance including adding new value oriented product offerings  strengthening our design and sales talent  and incorporating elements of the new store prototype into more of our stores 
in the recently acquired stores  it has generally taken six to twelve months of operations by corporate retail management to either implement the changes necessary to improve performance in these stores or to make a final determination regarding their on going viability 
certain items affecting comparability between periods are noted below in investment and real estate segment and other items affecting net loss 
our operating results were negatively or positively impacted by certain restructuring and non recurring items as detailed below income from continued dumping subsidy offset act restructuring  impaired asset charges and unusual gains  net impairment of goodwill impairment of leasehold improvements asset impairment charge associated with closed plants supply contract termination costs associated with fiberboard plant closure severance other restructuring lease exit costs licensee debt cancellation charges fiscal income from the continued dumping subsidy offset act income from the continued dumping subsidy offset act cdsoa in continued to be at reduced levels from years prior to due to legislation enacted in that ends cdsoa distributions for monies collected after september  distributions of monies collected prior to that date have continued during  and a final distribution of the cdsoa funds  may be made in  although the unpredictable outcome of the legal proceedings in this matter will determine what our share will be  if any 
restructuring and asset impairment charges during fiscal  we recorded asset impairment charges of  these charges included costs of for the demolition of a previously closed facility in bassett  virginia  and associated with the relocation of our retail store in manchester  missouri 
we also incurred non cash charges which included for the additional write down of a previously closed manufacturing facility in mt 
airy  north carolina  and for the additional write down of a previously closed manufacturing facility in bassett  virginia for the write off of leasehold improvements and other assets due to the closure of six company owned retail locations in albuquerque  new mexico  bear  delaware  bel air  maryland  carol stream  illinois  frederick  maryland  and spanish fort  alabama  and for the write off of leasehold improvements and other assets associated with the relocation of our store in manchester  missouri 
total non cash impairment charges described above for the year ended november  were  lease exit costs during fiscal  we recorded charges of  in connection with our company owned retail stores for lease exit costs and lease modifications which included a non cash charge of for lease exit costs related to the closure of a retail store in albuquerque  new mexico  non cash charges of  to reflect reduced estimates of recoverable lease costs at four previously closed retail locations  non cash charges of for lease exit costs associated with the closure of the bel air and frederick  maryland stores as well as a previously closed location in lewisville  texas  and a charge of  for a cash payment made for the modification of an existing lease at one of our retail store locations 
licensee debt cancellation charges during fiscal  we gained significant liquidity as a result of the sale of our investment in ihfc 
this liquidity event enabled us to become more opportunistic in managing our relationships with our licensees and therefore accelerate certain licensees ability to rebuild their businesses after several years of extremely difficult industry conditions 
as such  during the second fiscal quarter of  we cancelled certain debts of what we consider to be key licensees in select markets 
while the debts cancelled were considered to be collectible over time  we believe that  rather than requiring repayment of these obligations  we will realize a greater long term benefit by the cancellation of these debts 
in exchange for relieving the debts of these licensees and thus strengthening their respective financial positions  we believe these licensees will be in a much better position to reinvest in all aspects of their store operations new product offerings  personnel  advertising  building appeal  etc 
which will ultimately lead to increased sales and profitability of the bassett brand 
as a result of this debt cancellation  we incurred a charge for the year ended november  of  fiscal other than income of from the cdsoa  no restructuring charges or other significant non recurring items were included in our loss from operations 
fiscal in  we recorded non cash asset impairment charges of  for the write off of the remaining leasehold improvements for our arlington  texas and alpharetta  georgia retail stores as well as the closure of our retail office in greensboro  north carolina 
also included in that amount was a non cash charge to write down the carrying value of our long lived assets associated with an underperforming retail location 
we recorded non cash charges of  for lease exit costs related to the closure of the leased facilities noted above see also note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
we recorded a non cash charge of for the write off of goodwill associated with store acquisitions in see also note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
we recorded a non cash charge to write down the value of the property and equipment as a result of the fiberboard plant closure in the fourth quarter of in addition  we recorded a charge associated with the termination of a power supply contract for the fiberboard plant 
lastly  we recorded severance charges of associated with a reduction in workforce announced in march and associated with the fiberboard plant closure

excluding sales of fiberboard product  the production of which was discontinued in late  wholesale shipments increased by over this increase in shipments was indicative of slightly improving market conditions  particularly in the latter part of in addition  shipments during the first half of were adversely affected by delays in receiving imported product from certain of our overseas suppliers 
in an effort to mitigate the stock outages caused by these delays and improve service levels to our customers  we began to increase inventory levels during the second and third quarters of as a result  we were able to substantially eliminate the excess backlog of delayed shipments during the final quarter of the year 
approximately and of wholesale shipments during and  respectively  were imported products 
gross margins for the wholesale segment were for as compared to for this increase is due to improved margins on the imported wood and upholstery products as well as the closure of the fiberboard plant during the fourth quarter of which essentially operated at a breakeven gross profit during  partially offset by the introduction of a lower cost upholstery line that has a slightly lower margin  and higher freight costs on imported product during the fourth quarter of wholesale sg a expense  excluding bad debt and notes receivable valuation charges  declined  or  for as compared to  due primarily to lower spending due to continued cost cutting measures 
we recorded  of bad debt and notes receivable valuation charges in as compared to  for this significant decrease in charges is primarily due to our efforts to work diligently with the licensees to control increases in accounts and notes receivable exposure 
in addition  many of the distressed licensee owned stores for which significant bad debt and notes receivable valuation charges were required in have since been acquired by us and are now run as company owned stores

retail backlog the dollar value of our retail backlog  representing orders received but not yet delivered to customers as of november   november   and november   was as follows year end retail backlog retail backlog per open store investment and real estate segment and other items affecting net income loss our investments and real estate segment consists of our investments in marketable securities  our investment in the fortress value recovery fund i  llc fortress  equity investments in ihfc sold during the second quarter of and zenith  and retail real estate related to licensee stores 
although this segment does not have operating earnings  income or loss from the segment is included in other income in our consolidated statements of operations 
our equity investment in ihfc was not included in the identifiable assets of this segment at november  since it had a negative book value and was therefore included in the long term liabilities section of our consolidated balance sheet 
as more fully discussed under liquidity and capital resources below  our entire investment in ihfc was sold during the second quarter of resulting in a gain of  we own of zenith freight lines  llc  zenith which provides domestic transportation and warehousing services primarily to furniture manufacturers and distributors and also provides home delivery services to furniture retailers 
we have contracted with zenith to provide for substantially all of our domestic freight  transportation and warehousing needs for the wholesale business 
in addition  zenith provides home delivery services for several of our company owned retail stores 
we believe our partnership with zenith allows us to focus on our core competencies of manufacturing and marketing home furnishings 
zenith focuses on offering bassett customers best of class service and handling 
we consider the expertise that zenith exhibits in logistics to be a significant competitive advantage for us 
in addition  we believe that zenith is well positioned to take advantage of current growth opportunities for providing logistical services to the furniture industry 
our investment in zenith was  at november  during the second quarter of  we made an additional cash investment of  which represented our share of a total  equity contribution to zenith to partially fund their acquisition of a warehouse facility 
investment and real estate income loss and other items affecting net income loss for fiscal  and are as follows gain on sale of ihfc loss from alternative asset fund gain on sale of equity securities other than temporary impairment of investments income from unconsolidated affiliated companies  net interest expense retail real estate impairment charges lease exit costs loan and lease guarantee expense gain on mortgage settlements other total income loss the alternative asset fund recorded a loss of  for fiscal in fiscal  we requested our general partner in the alternative asset fund  private advisors  llc  to attempt to liquidate all of our investments in the fund 
during fiscal we received  for liquidations associated with various investments in the alternative asset fund 
as of november   the alternative asset fund held only a investment in fortress  along with some remaining cash that was distributed in early due to the level of the remaining assets in the alternative asset fund  the company and private advisors  llc dissolved the partnership effective december  and the alternative asset fund s remaining investment interest in fortress was transferred to the company 
historically  our marketable securities have been held by two different money managers and consisted of a combination of equity and fixed income securities  including money market funds 
during the second quarter of  we liquidated our equity holdings with one of the managers and reinvested the proceeds in various money market funds  individual bonds and bond funds 
during the first quarter of  we liquidated the equity holdings with the other manager and reinvested those funds in money market accounts 
we review our marketable securities to determine whether a decline in fair value of a security below the cost basis is other than temporary 
should the decline be considered other than temporary  we write down the cost basis of the security and include the loss in current earnings as opposed to recording an unrealized holding loss 
due to the decline in the financial markets during fiscal and into the first quarter of fiscal  many of our holdings sustained significant losses 
consequently  we recorded  in other than temporary losses in our consolidated statement of operations in fiscal income from unconsolidated affiliated companies  net includes income from our investment in ihfc up to the time of the sale of our investment in the second quarter of as well as income from our equity method investment in zenith 
we recognized income from ihfc and zenith as follows ihfc zenith loan and lease guarantee expense consists of adjustments to our reserves for the net amount of our estimated losses on loan and lease guarantees that we have entered into on behalf of our licensees 
we recognized expense of   and  for fiscal  and  respectively  to reflect the changes in our estimates of the additional risk that we may have to assume the underlying obligations with respect to our guarantees 
retail real estate impairment charges for include non cash asset impairment charges of  to write down idle retail locations in henderson  nevada and chesterfield  virginia to appraised value  and  to write off certain tenant improvements deemed to be unrecoverable 
lease exit costs of for consist of non cash charges related to lease termination costs at three idle retail locations 
during  we entered into discounted payoff agreements dpos with the lenders on three mortgages which were then paid off 
under the terms of these dpos  the remaining balance owed was reduced  resulting in a  gain on the settlement of these mortgages 
provision for income taxes we recorded an income tax provision benefit of  and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
for  our effective tax rate of approximately differs from the blended statutory rate of primarily due to the reversal of a substantial portion of the valuation allowance on existing deferred tax assets resulting from our utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and credits to significantly offset the taxable gain on the sale of an equity investment see sale of ihfc below 
the benefit recognized in fiscal arose primarily as a result of the lapse of the statute of limitations on unrecognized state tax benefits  partially offset by the accrual of income taxes to be paid in certain states and penalties associated with certain unrecognized tax benefits 
the benefit recognized in fiscal resulted from our utilization of additional net operating loss carrybacks as provided by the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of which extended the general carryback period for nols from two years to up to five 
our effective income tax rates for and were and  respectively 
the effective rate for those years was favorably impacted by exclusions for dividends received from our investment in ihfc and unfavorably impacted in fiscal by the write off of goodwill 
see also note  income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements for a full reconciliation of the effective income tax rate for fiscal  and  as well as additional information regarding our available nols and other deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we continue to have  of deferred tax assets as of november   substantially offset by a valuation allowance of  this allowance will remain until such time that our historical operating results and expected future income are sufficient to indicate that it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized 
should we conclude in the future that there is adequate evidence to reverse the remaining valuation allowance  we will recognize a tax benefit in the period in which such a determination is made 
liquidity and capital resources we are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet in order to weather the current difficult industry conditions  to allow us to take advantage of opportunities as market conditions improve  and to execute our long term retail strategies 
because new housing starts are down and consumers continue to be faced with general economic uncertainty fueled by continuing high unemployment  high fuel costs  and renewed volatility in the financial markets  consumer spending has decreased  resulting in significant financial losses for us and damaging the ability of certain of our licensees to generate sufficient cash flow in their businesses 
during fiscal  we implemented measures to reduce operating expenses and improve working capital to enhance our cash flow  and have continued to carefully manage our cost structure and working capital throughout fiscal and sale of ihfc on may   we completed the sale of our investment in ihfc  receiving cash proceeds of  and recording a gain of  we have retired certain debt and other long term obligations  settled various closed stores and idle facilities obligations  resumed paying a quarterly dividend  began buying back stock and paid a special dividend of per share 
we will continue to evaluate appropriate uses of available cash which may include more of such items previously listed along with future working capital needs and modest investments in new or repositioned company owned stores 
in addition to the  of cash received upon or following the closing of the ihfc sale  we expect to receive additional cash proceeds from the sale of ihfc as follows tax escrow receivable indemnification escrow receivable total remaining cash consideration receivable from ihfc sale included in other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at november   included in other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at november   with the remainder included in other assets 
the tax escrow receivable represents the portion of escrowed sales proceeds expected to be released to us after the settlement of certain outstanding ihfc tax obligations 
in addition   of proceeds was placed in escrow to indemnify the purchaser with respect to various contingencies 
any unused portions of these escrowed funds will be released to us over a three year period 
currently  we have no reason to believe that any obligations will arise out of such contingencies and therefore expect that the escrowed funds  along with earnings thereon  will be released to us in their entirety as scheduled 
cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by used in operating activities was   and  for fiscal  and respectively 
cash used in operations during was  as compared with cash provided by operations of  for  a decline in operating cash flow of  this decrease is primarily attributable to settlement of accounts payable during the first quarter of related to the build up of inventory during the second half of we also made estimated federal and state tax payments of  resulting from the taxable income generated by the gain on the sale of ihfc 
also  a cash payment of  to obtain a lease modification for one of our company owned store locations was funded out of operating cash flow in the second quarter of our overall cash position increased for by  primarily due to the  of cash proceeds received from the sale of our interest in ihfc as discussed above  as well as a final dividend paid to us by ihfc prior to the sale in the amount of  in addition  cash provided by investing activities includes  from the release of collateral restrictions on cash equivalents 
these cash flows were partially offset by cash used for other investing activities which included  in fixed asset additions  largely for improvement to certain of our company owned retail stores and leasehold improvements associated with repositioning our manchester  missouri store  and an equity capital contribution to zenith of  which represented our share of a total  equity contribution to zenith to partially fund their acquisition of a warehouse facility 
cash used in financing activities for consisted primarily of payments on our mortgages and other notes payable of  as well as cash dividends paid of and stock repurchases in the amount of  in addition to the  of cash on hand  we have marketable securities available for sale consisting of  in bond funds and individual debt securities 
with the current level of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand  we believe we have sufficient liquidity to fund operations for the foreseeable future 
receivables and inventory cash collections on our accounts and notes receivable have a significant impact on our overall liquidity 
while our cash flow from operations during fiscal was adversely affected by an increase in accounts receivable before reserves due to the continued difficult environment at retail resulting in lower cash collections  this trend eased somewhat during however  cash collections during the third quarter of were adversely affected by delayed shipments due to stock outages 
shipments improved significantly during the fourth quarter of  and we had begun to see the expected resulting improvement in collections from our customers by the end of and through as previously discussed  we gained significant liquidity as a result of the sale of our investment in ihfc see sale of ihfc above 
this liquidity event has enabled us to become more opportunistic in managing our relationships with our licensees and therefore accelerate certain licensees ability to rebuild their businesses after several years of extremely difficult industry conditions 
as such  during the second quarter of  we cancelled certain debts of what we consider to be key licensees in select markets 
while the debts cancelled were considered to be collectible over time  we believe that  rather than requiring repayment of these obligations  we will realize a greater long term benefit by the cancellation of these debts 
in exchange for relieving the debts of these licensees and thus strengthening their respective financial positions  we believe these licensees will be in a much better position to reinvest in all aspects of their store operations new product offerings  personnel  advertising  building appeal  etc 
which will ultimately lead to increased sales and profitability of the bassett brand 
as a result of this debt cancellation  we incurred a charge during the second quarter of in the amount of  our percentage of accounts receivable that are over days past due has decreased from approximately at november  to less than at november  we recorded  of bad debt and notes receivable valuation charges during as compared to  during this increase reflects the continued deterioration of certain of our licensees during the following table reflects our accounts receivable and notes receivable and related bad debt reserves november  november  gross accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts net accounts receivable gross notes receivable allowance for doubtful accounts and discounts on notes receivable net notes receivable our accounts and notes receivable reserve and notes discount activity for fiscal are as follows accounts notes receivable receivable total balance at november  bad debt and note valuation charges write offs discount amortization balance at november  our licensee review committee lrc consists of our ceo  cao  senior vp of retail  vp of licensed retail  general counsel  and corporate director of credit 
the lrc meets frequently to review licensee performance  typically reviewing a wide range of licensee related issues  including licensee capitalization  projected operating performance  the viability of the market in which the licensee operates and the licensee s operating history  including our cash receipts from the licensee and its sales 
should a licensee have substantial past due amounts due to us  but is otherwise considered viable and likely to continue as a going concern  the lrc has  in the past  decided to move all or a portion of the licensee s past due accounts receivable to a note receivable 
we believed that the note receivable allowed the licensee to focus on keeping current and future amounts current  while continuing to meet its financial obligations to us 
we no longer believe this to be a prudent strategy and do not plan to convert additional past due receivables into long term interest bearing notes in the foreseeable future 
our accounts and notes receivable are secured by the filing of security statements in accordance with the uniform commercial code and or real estate owned by the note holder and in some cases  personal guarantees by our licensees 
our practice has generally been to work with the store owner to run a going out of business sale and use any proceeds to fund the remaining receivable 
our success with these events has varied 
however  typically the amounts recovered have not been materially different from the carrying amount of the receivable 
consequently  we generally have not been required to record significant bad debt expenses upon the conclusion of the event 
our investment in inventory affects our liquidity in several different ways 
first  cash paid for raw materials  labor  and factory overhead for the manufacture or assembly of our domestic inventories is typically paid out well in advance of receiving cash from the sale of these inventories 
payments for our imported inventories are funded much further in advance of receiving cash from the sale of these inventories as compared to our domestically manufactured or assembled inventories 
the length of our import supply chain necessitates complex forecasting of future demand levels and is highly judgmental 
in economic downturns  the speed at which we can respond to decreasing demand is slowed  as we typically have imported inventory in shipment or being manufactured at any given time 
in addition  we may also have inventory commitments under purchase orders that have not begun the manufacturing process 
consequently  as inventories build temporarily during downturns or as we near new product roll outs  our liquidity is reduced as we have more cash invested in our products 
second  the availability under our revolving credit facility is impacted by changes in our inventory balances 
lastly  if we fail to respond to changes in consumer tastes quickly enough  inventories may build and decrease our liquidity 
our inventories consist of the following november  november  wholesale finished goods work in process raw materials and supplies retail merchandise total inventories on first in  first out method lifo adjustment reserve for excess and obsolete inventory we estimate an inventory reserve for excess quantities and obsolete items based on specific identification and historical write offs  taking into account future demand  market conditions and the respective valuations at lifo 
the need for these reserves is primarily driven by the normal product life cycle 
as products mature and sales volumes decline  we rationalize our product offerings to respond to consumer tastes and keep our product lines fresh 
if actual demand or market conditions in the future are less favorable than those estimated  additional inventory write downs may be required 
in determining reserves  we calculate separate reserves on our wholesale and retail inventories 
our wholesale inventories tend to carry the majority of the reserves for excess quantities and obsolete inventory due to the nature of our distribution model 
these wholesale reserves primarily represent design and or style obsolescence 
typically  product is not shipped to our retail warehouses until a consumer has ordered and paid a deposit for the product 
we do not typically hold retail inventory for stock purposes 
consequently  floor sample inventory and inventory for delivery to customers account for the majority of our inventory at retail 
retail reserves are based on accessory and clearance floor sample inventory in our stores and any inventory that is not associated with a specific customer order in our retail warehouses 
activity in the reserves for excess quantities and obsolete inventory by segment is as follows wholesale segment retail segment total balance at november  additions charged to expense write offs balance at november  additions charged to expense write offs balance at november  our estimates and assumptions have been reasonably accurate in the past 
we did not make any significant changes to our methodology for determining inventory reserves in and do not anticipate that our methodology is reasonably likely to change in the future 
a plus or minus change in our inventory reserves would not have been material to our financial statements for the periods presented 
debt and other obligations with our current level of liquidity  we have substantially reduced the size of our line of credit with our bank 
on july   we entered into a temporary renewal agreement with our bank for a  revolving line of credit that matured september  on september   we received a commitment letter from our bank offering a  line of credit which will be used primarily to back our outstanding letters of credit 
this new credit facility  which became effective on december   contains covenants requiring us to maintain certain key financial ratios  however there will be no requirement to pledge assets as collateral 
at november   we had  outstanding under standby letters of credit 
we have two mortgages totaling  as of november  we expect to satisfy the remaining mortgage obligations from cash flow from operations or our available cash on hand 
we lease land and buildings that are used in the operation of our company owned retail stores as well as in the operation of licensee owned stores 
we had obligations of  at november  for future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating leases having remaining terms in excess of one year 
we also have guaranteed certain lease obligations of licensee operators 
lease guarantees range from one to ten years 
we were contingently liable under licensee lease obligation guarantees in the amount of  at november  we have also guaranteed loans of certain of our licensees to finance initial inventory packages for those stores 
the total contingent liabilities with respect to these loan guarantees were at november  dividends and share repurchases in early  in response to the pressures placed upon our cash flows brought on by the severity of the economic recession  we suspended our practice of paying regular dividends 
due to the substantial improvement in our liquidity resulting from the sale of our interest in ihfc  we resumed the payment of dividends and began repurchasing shares in the open market late in the second quarter of fiscal during fiscal  two quarterly dividends totaling were paid to shareholders  with a third quarterly dividend of and a special dividend of  being distributed to shareholders in december of during fiscal  we also repurchased  shares of our stock for  the weighted average effect of these share repurchases was to increase our basic and diluted earnings per share in by and  respectively 
capital expenditures we currently anticipate that total capital expenditures for fiscal will be between  and  which will be used primarily for the build out of new stores and remodeling of existing company owned stores 
our capital expenditure and working capital requirements in the foreseeable future may change depending on many factors  including but not limited to the overall performance of the new prototype stores  our rate of growth  our operating results and any adjustments in our operating plan needed in response to industry conditions  competition or unexpected events 
we believe that our existing cash and marketable securities portfolio  together with cash from operations  will be sufficient to meet our capital expenditure and working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
fair value measurements we account for items measured at fair value in accordance with asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures 
asc s valuation techniques are based on observable and unobservable inputs 
observable inputs reflect readily obtainable data from independent sources  while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions 
asc classifies these inputs into the following hierarchy level inputs quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets 
level inputs quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active  and model derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable 
level inputs instruments with primarily unobservable value drivers 
areas which involve significant fair value estimates in determining the amounts recognized in our financial statements and the level of inputs utilized are as follows note references refer to our consolidated financial statements included under item in this annual report hierarchy level of utilized inputs financial statement note reference marketable securities level note investment in fortress level note acquisitions goodwill level note loan lease guarantees level note all other fair value estimates which are made for disclosure purposes only utilize level inputs see note to our consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations and commitments we enter into contractual obligations and commercial commitments in the ordinary course of business see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of these obligations 
the following table summarizes our contractual payment obligations and other commercial commitments and the fiscal year in which they are expected to be paid 
thereafter total post employment benefit obligations real estate notes payable other obligations commitments interest payable letters of credit operating leases lease guarantees loan guarantees purchase obligations total does not reflect a reduction for the impact of any company owned life insurance proceeds to be received 
currently  we have life insurance policies with net death benefits of  to provide funding for these obligations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
does not reflect a reduction for the impact of sublease income to be received 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
the company is not a party to any long term supply contracts with respect to the purchase of raw materials or finished goods 
at the end of fiscal year  we had approximately  in open purchase orders  primarily for imported inventories  which are in the ordinary course of business 
lease and loan guarantees relate to payments we would only be required to make in the event of default on the part of the guaranteed parties 
off balance sheet arrangements we utilize stand by letters of credit in the procurement of certain goods in the normal course of business 
we lease land and buildings that are primarily used in the operation of bhf stores 
we have guaranteed certain lease obligations of licensee operators as part of our retail strategy 
we also have guaranteed loans of certain of our licensees to finance initial inventory packages for these stores 
see contractual obligations and commitments table above and note to the consolidated financial statements  included in item of this annual report on form k  for further discussion of operating leases  lease guarantees and loan guarantees  including descriptions of the terms of such commitments and methods used to mitigate risks associated with these arrangements 
contingencies we are involved in various claims and litigation as well as environmental matters  which arise in the normal course of business 
although the final outcome of these legal and environmental matters cannot be determined  based on the facts presently known  it is our opinion that the final resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or future results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap which requires that certain estimates and assumptions be made that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in those financial statements and the related accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
we use our best judgment in valuing these estimates and may  as warranted  solicit external advice 
estimates are based on current facts and circumstances  prior experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable 
the following critical accounting policies  some of which are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates  affect our consolidated financial statements 
consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of bassett furniture industries  incorporated and its majority owned subsidiaries for whom we have operating control 
we also consolidate variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when the risks and rewards of ownership and title to the product have transferred to the buyer 
this generally occurs upon the shipment of goods to independent dealers or  in the case of company owned retail stores  upon delivery to the customer 
our payment terms generally vary from to days 
an estimate for returns and allowances has been provided in recorded sales 
the contracts with our licensee store owners do not provide for any royalty or license fee to be paid to us 
staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab outlines the four basic criteria for recognizing revenue as follows persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
sab further asserts that if collectibility of all or a portion of the revenue is not reasonably assured  revenue recognition should be deferred until payment is received 
during fiscal  and  there were four  seven and thirteen dealers  respectively  for which these criteria were not met and therefore revenue was being recognized on a cost recovery basis 
as of november  and november   zero and two dealers  respectively  remained on the cost recovery basis 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
our accounts receivable reserves were  and  at november  and november   respectively  representing and of our gross accounts receivable balances at those dates  respectively 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on a review of specifically identified customer accounts in addition to an overall aging analysis 
we evaluate the collectibility of our receivables from our licensees and other customers on a quarterly basis based on factors such as their financial condition  our collateral position  potential future plans with licensees and other similar factors 
our allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate of potential losses on our accounts and notes receivable and is adjusted accordingly based on historical experience  current developments and present economic conditions and trends 
in the current economic environment  our historical experience with customers carries less weight than in previous years 
the timeliness of a licensee s or customer s ability to pay us can deteriorate at a much faster pace than in previous years 
as such  despite our best efforts  the ultimate precision with respect to our allowance for doubtful accounts is likely to be less when compared to previous periods 
although actual losses have not differed materially from our previous estimates  future losses could differ from our current estimates 
unforeseen events such as a licensee or customer bankruptcy filing could have a material impact on our results of operations 
long term notes receivable previously  when in the ordinary course of business a licensee had substantial past due amounts due to the company  but was otherwise considered viable and likely to continue as a going concern  we may have decided to move all or a portion of a licensee s past due accounts receivable to a long term interest bearing note receivable 
we believed that the note receivable allowed the licensee to focus on keeping current and future amounts current  while continuing to meet its financial obligations to us 
we no longer believe this to be a prudent strategy and do not plan to convert additional past due receivables into long term interest bearing notes in the foreseeable future 
some of these notes are collateralized by real estate 
at the inception of the note receivable  we determine whether the note bears a market rate of interest 
in estimating a market rate of interest  we first consider factors such as licensee capitalization  projected operating performance  the viability of the market in which the licensee operates and the licensee s operating history  including our cash receipts from the licensee  licensee sales and any underlying collateral 
for those licensees where there is a concern of collectibility  our estimated market rate of interest is based on certain published high yield bond indices 
for those where collectibility is less of a concern  the estimated market rate of interest is generally based on the prime rate 
a discount on the note is recorded if we determine that the note bears an interest rate below the market rate and a premium is recorded if we determine that the note bears an interest rate above the market rate 
we amortize the related note discount or premium over the contractual term of the note and cease amortizing the discount to interest income when the present value of expected future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the note 
interest income associated with the discount amortization is immaterial and is recorded in other loss  net  in our consolidated statement of operations 
on a quarterly basis we examine these notes for evidence of impairment  considering factors such as licensee capitalization  projected operating performance  the viability of the market in which the licensee operates and the licensee s operating history  including our cash receipts from the licensee  licensee sales and any underlying collateral 
after considering these factors  should we believe that all or a portion of the note receivable cannot or will not be paid  we record an impairment charge on the note using discounted cash flow methods to determine the impairment charge 
an impairment charge does not necessarily indicate that a loan has no recovery or salvage value  but rather that  based on management s judgment and the consideration of specific licensee factors  it is more prudent than not to record an impairment charge 
our allowance for doubtful accounts and discounts on notes receivable were  and  at november  and november   respectively  representing and of our gross notes receivable balances at those dates  respectively 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined for domestic furniture inventories using the last in  first out method 
the cost of imported inventories is determined on a first in  first out basis 
we estimate an inventory reserve for excess quantities and obsolete items based on specific identification and historical write offs  taking into account future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand or market conditions in the future are less favorable than those estimated  additional inventory write downs may be required 
valuation allowance on deferred tax assets we evaluate our deferred income tax assets to determine if valuation allowances are required or should be adjusted 
a valuation allowance is established against our deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence  both positive and negative  using a more likely than not standard 
this assessment considers  among other matters  the nature  frequency and severity of recent losses  forecasts of future profitability  the duration of statutory carryforward periods  our experience with tax attributes expiring unused and tax planning alternatives 
in making such judgments  significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
investments and marketable securities investments and marketable securities are marked to market and recorded at their fair value 
we account for our investment in fortress by marking it to market value each month based on the net asset values provided by the fund manager  adjusted for estimated liquidity discounts 
unrealized holding gains and losses  net of the related income tax effect  on available for sale securities are excluded from income and are reported as other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses from securities classified as available for sale are included in income and are determined using the specific identification method for ascertaining the cost of securities sold 
we also review our available for sale securities to determine whether a decline in fair value of a security below the cost basis is other than temporary 
should the decline be considered other than temporary  we write down the cost of the security and include the loss in current earnings 
in determining whether a decline is other than temporary  we consider such factors as the significance of the decline as compared to the cost basis  the current state of the financial markets and the economy  the length of time for which there has been an unrealized loss and the relevant information regarding the operations of the investee 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the value assigned to tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired 
the acquisition of assets and liabilities and any resulting goodwill is allocated to the respective reporting unit  wholesale  retail or real estate investments 
we review goodwill at the reporting unit level annually for impairment or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired 
the goodwill impairment test consists of a two step process  if necessary 
effective with our annual assessment of goodwill performed as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal  we have adopted the provisions of asu no 
 which updates the guidance in asc topic  intangibles goodwill other 
per asc topic  as amended by asu  we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test described in asc topic the more likely than not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than percent 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary and our goodwill is considered to be unimpaired 
however  if based on our qualitative assessment we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  we will proceed with performing the two step process 
the first step compares the carrying value of each reporting unit that has goodwill with the estimated fair value of the respective reporting unit 
should the carrying value of a reporting unit be in excess of the estimated fair value of that reporting unit  the second step is performed whereby we must calculate the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit 
this second step represents a hypothetical purchase price allocation as if we had acquired the reporting unit on that date 
our impairment methodology uses a discounted cash flow analysis requiring certain assumptions and estimates to be made regarding future profitability of the reporting unit and industry economic factors 
while we believe such assumptions and estimates are reasonable  the actual results may differ materially from the projected amounts 
impairment of long lived assets we periodically evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate long lived assets may not be recoverable or that the remaining useful life may warrant revision 
when such events or circumstances are present  we assess the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through the expected undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset 
in the event the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value is recorded 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued asu no 
 which updates the guidance in asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures  related to disclosures about fair value measurements 
new disclosures will require entities to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and to describe the reasons for the transfers  and to present separately in the reconciliation for fair value measurements in level information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements on a gross basis rather than as one net amount 
the asu also amends asc subtopic to clarify certain existing disclosures regarding the level of disaggregation at which fair value measurements are provided for each class of assets and liabilities  and disclosures about inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements that fall in either level or level the new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the reconciliation of level fair value measurements  which become effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we implemented the new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures beginning with our second quarter of fiscal  and the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the reconciliation of level fair value measurements will be implemented beginning in our first quarter of fiscal the adoption of this guidance has not had  and is not expected to have  a material impact on our financial position or results of operations

in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 which updates the guidance in asc topic  business combinations 
the objective of asu is to address diversity in practice about the interpretation of the pro forma revenue and earnings disclosure requirements for business combinations 
the amendments in asu specify that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements  the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination s that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only 
the amendments also expand the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
the amendments affect any public entity as defined by asc that enters into business combinations that are material on an individual or aggregate basis 
this guidance will become effective for us for acquisitions occurring on or after the beginning of our fiscal year 
we do not expect the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact upon our financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued asu no 
 which updated the guidance in asc topic  fair value measurement 
the amendments in this update generally represent clarifications of topic  but also include some instances where a particular principle or requirement for measuring fair value or disclosing information about fair value measurements has changed

under the amendments in this update  an entity has the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in both choices  an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income  each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income  and a total amount for comprehensive income 
this update eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
the amendments in this update do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income 
the amendments in this update should be applied retrospectively 
for public entities  the amendments are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december   and early application is permitted 
in december of  the fasb issued asu no 
 which defers only those provisions within asu pertaining to reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income

the amendments in asu affect all entities that have goodwill reported in their financial statements 
the amendments in asu permit an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test described in asc topic the more likely than not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than percent 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  an entity determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary 
the amendments in this update include examples of events and circumstances that an entity should consider in evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  however the examples are not intended to be all inclusive and an entity my identify other relevant events and circumstances to consider in making the determination 
the examples in this update supersede the previous examples under asc topic of events and circumstances an entity should consider in determining whether it should test for impairment between annual tests  and also supersede the examples of events and circumstances that an entity having a reporting unit with a zero or negative should consider in determining whether to perform the second step of the impairment test 
under the amendments in this update  an entity is no longer permitted to carry forward its detailed calculation of a reporting unit s fair value from a prior year as previously permitted under asc topic as permitted by asu  we have adopted the provisions of this update effective for our fiscal annual test for goodwill impairment  performed as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal the adoption of this update did not have a material impact upon our financial positions or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk for changes in market prices of our marketable securities 
at november   we had  in marketable securities which consisted of a portfolio of bond funds and fixed income securities 
maturity dates on the fixed income securities in the portfolio range from one to twenty years 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in the value of foreign currencies 
substantially all of our imports purchased outside of north america are denominated in us dollars 
therefore  we believe that gains or losses resulting from changes in the value of foreign currencies relating to foreign purchases not denominated in us dollars would not be material to our results from operations in fiscal we are exposed to market risk from changes in the cost of raw materials used in our manufacturing processes  principally wood  woven fabric  and foam products 
a recovery in home construction could result in increases in wood and fabric costs from current levels  and the cost of foam products  which are petroleum based  is sensitive to changes in the price of oil 
we have potential exposure to market risk related to the current weakness in the commercial real estate market 
our retail real estate holdings of  for licensee operated stores as well as our holdings of  for company owned stores at november  could suffer significant impairment in value if we are forced to close additional stores and sell or lease the related properties in the current market 
additionally  if we are required to assume responsibility for payment under the  of lease obligations we have guaranteed on behalf of licensees as of november   we may not be able to secure sufficient sub lease income in the current market to offset the payments required under the guarantees
