item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended december   which are included in item of part ii of this annual report 
recent developments effective on january   the insurance group sold substantially all of its assets  net of cash  to an unrelated third party the acquirer for million 
prior to that date  the insurance group operated as a full service insurance agency with offices in maryland and west virginia 
as part of this sale  we agreed that we would not compete with the acquirer for insurance business other than with respect to insurance related to our banking  trust  lending  consumer finance company  and or securities sales businesses 
we also agreed to not solicit the acquirer s customers or any person who was a customer of the insurance group at any time within three years prior to the sale 
these restrictions will terminate on january  as a result of these agreements  we anticipate that our insurance activities for the foreseeable future will be limited to the sale of credit related insurance products and the sale  through our networking arrangements  of annuities 
also as part of the sale  we agreed  until january   to refer insurance business to the acquirer 
to the extent permitted by law  we will be entitled to a referral fee  equal to of the commission payable to the acquirer  when our referrals result in the sale of an insurance policy of a type not previously sold to the customer by the acquirer 
total revenues for were million and pre tax operating expenses  net of amortization expense and expenses related to the sale were million 
management does not expect the sale of the insurance group s assets or the referral arrangement to have a material impact on our future financial condition or results of operations 
overview first united corporation is a financial holding company which  through the bank and its non bank subsidiaries  provides an array of financial products and services primarily to customers in four western maryland counties and four northeastern west virginia counties 
its principal operating subsidiary is the bank  which consists of a community banking network of branch offices located throughout its market areas 
our primary sources of revenue are interest income earned from our loan and investment securities portfolios and fees earned from financial services provided to customers 
consolidated net income available to common shareholders was million for the year ended december   compared to a net loss attributable to common shareholders of million for the same period of basic and diluted net income per common share for the year ended december  were  compared to basic and diluted net loss per common share of for the same period of the change in earnings  from a net loss for the year ended december  to net income for the year ended december   resulted primarily from a million reduction in provision for loan losses and a million reduction in net losses from sales of securities and other real estate owned 
in addition   in non cash other than temporary impairment otti charges were realized for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period of during  we also recognized a gain of million from the sale of a portion of the indirect auto loan portfolio 
the decreases in expenses and the gain on the sale of indirect auto loans were offset by a decrease of million in income tax benefit and a decline in net interest income of million 
the decrease in net interest income was driven by an million reduction in interest income on a fully tax equivalent fte basis attributable to lower levels of loans  the sale of a portion of the indirect auto portfolio and the lower interest rate environment 
the net interest margin for the year ended december   on an fte basis  increased to from for the year ended december  the increase in the net interest margin was driven primarily by the strategic plan to reduce cash levels by paying off certain liabilities that matured during and to change the composition of our deposit mix  focusing on lower cost core deposits 
the provision for loan losses was million for the year ended december   compared to million for fiscal year the lower provision expense was primarily due to a leveling in the credit quality of our loan portfolio 
management continued to make specific allocations for impaired loans where it was determined that the collateral supporting the loans is not adequate to cover the loan balance  and management adjusted the qualitative factors affecting the allowance for loan losses the all to reflect changes in the economic environment 
interest expense on our interest bearing liabilities decreased million during when compared to due primarily to a planned decrease of million in average interest bearing deposits and a million decrease in average debt outstanding 
management used cash to repay wholesale deposits and fhlb advances 
the decline in expense was also due to the low interest rate environment and our strategy to provide special pricing only to full relationship customers 
other operating income increased million during when compared to this increase was primarily attributable to an million decrease in non cash credit related otti charges  and a decrease of million in net losses related to sales of securities  sales and write downs of other real estate owned and a gain recognized on the sale of a portion of the indirect auto loan portfolio 
operating expenses decreased million during when compared to the same period of this decrease was due primarily to a million decline in salaries and benefits related to a reduction in full time equivalents through attrition and reduced pension expense and a decline of million in fdic premiums attributable to the repayment of brokered deposits 
comparing december  to december   outstanding loans decreased by million  net of the sale of million of the indirect auto portfolio 
cre loans decreased million as a result of the payoff of several large loans  charge offs of loan balances and ongoing scheduled principal payments 
commercial and industrial c i loans increased million and residential mortgages declined million 
acquisition and development loans decreased million due to principal repayments and charge offs 
the decrease in the residential mortgage portfolio was attributable to regularly scheduled principal payments on existing loans and management s decision to use secondary market outlets such as fannie mae for the majority of new  longer term  fixed rate residential loan originations 
the consumer loan portfolio declined million due primarily to the sale of million of retail installment contracts in our indirect auto loan portfolio and million of repayment activity in the indirect auto portfolio which exceeded new production due to special financing offered by the automotive manufacturers  credit unions and certain large regional banks 
at december   approximately of the commercial loan portfolio was collateralized by real estate  compared to approximately at december  interest income on loans in decreased by million on an fte basis when compared to due to the decrease in interest rates and the decline the in loan balances during interest income on the investment securities decreased by million on an fte basis due to reinvesting called securities at lower rates 
additional information on the composition of interest income is available in table that appears on page 
total deposits decreased million during when compared to deposits at december  the decline in deposits was due to a strategic decision to use cash to repay wholesale deposits and fhlb advances 
the repayment of approximately million in wholesale deposits was offset by increases of million in non interest bearing deposits  million in traditional savings accounts and million in retail money market accounts 
time deposits less than  declined million while time deposits greater than  decreased million 
the decrease was due to a million decline in brokered certificates of deposit and cdars participation  and a decrease of million in retail certificates of deposit 
interest expense decreased million in when compared to the decline was due to an overall reduction in interest rates on time deposits driven by our decision to increase special rates only for full relationship customers  the shorter duration of the portfolio  lower balances and the increase in non interest bearing deposits 
the overall net interest margin increased during to from in on a fully taxable equivalent basis 
other operating income other operating expense other operating income  exclusive of losses  decreased 
million during the year ended december  when compared to fiscal year service charge income decreased 
million due primarily to a reduction in non sufficient funds nsf fees resulting from newly enacted regulation of overdraft fees 
debit card income increased 
million during when compared to due to increased consumer spending and higher customer awareness of our rewards program 
trust department income increased 
million during when compared to due to a slight increase in assets under management and the fees received on those accounts and increased fees collected on estate administration 
assets under management were approximately million at december   a increase over december  net gains of 
million were reported through other income during  compared to net losses of million during there were  in losses during that were attributable to non cash otti charges on the investment portfolio  down from the million during fiscal year the reduced otti charges resulted from the improvement in the financial industry  the debt securities of which make up the primary collateral for the securities in our collateralized debt obligation cdo portfolio 
net gains of 
million from sales of investments  the million gain from the sale of our indirect auto loan portfolio and 
million of gains on sales of other real estate owned were offset by million in write downs of other real estate owned 
other operating expenses decreased million for the year ended december  when compared to the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a million decline in salaries and benefits  resulting primarily from a reduction of full time equivalent employees through attrition and reduced pension expense  and a million decline in fdic premiums attributable to the repayment of brokered deposits 
dividends during  first united corporation did not declare or pay any dividends on the shares of its common stock on account of the board of directors decision in november to defer quarterly cash dividends on the series a preferred stock 
there were no dividends paid on the series a preferred stock in in  first united corporation paid a total of 
million in cash dividends on the shares of common stock and a total of million in cash dividends on the series a preferred stock 
looking forward we will continue to face risks and challenges in the future  including  without limitation  changes in local economic conditions in our core geographic markets  potential yield compression on loan and deposit products from existing competitors and potential new entrants in our markets  fluctuations in interest rates  and changes to existing federal and state laws and regulations that apply to banks and financial holding companies 
for a more complete discussion of these and other risk factors  see item a of part i of this annual report 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
on an on going basis  management evaluates estimates  including those related to loan losses and intangible assets 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for loan losses  or all one of our most important accounting policies is that related to the monitoring of the loan portfolio 
a variety of estimates impact the carrying value of the loan portfolio  including the calculation of the all  the valuation of underlying collateral  the timing of loan charge offs and the placement of loans on non accrual status 
the allowance is established and maintained at a level that management believes is adequate to cover losses resulting from the inability of borrowers to make required payment on loans 
estimates for loan losses are arrived at by analyzing risks associated with specific loans and the loan portfolio  current and historical trends in delinquencies and charge offs  and changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio 
the analysis also requires consideration of the economic climate and direction  changes in lending rates  political conditions  legislation impacting the banking industry and economic conditions specific to western maryland and northeastern west virginia 
because the calculation of the all relies on management s estimates and judgments relating to inherently uncertain events  actual results may differ from management s estimates 
the all is also discussed below in item under the heading allowance for loan losses and in note to the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and other intangible assets accounting standards codification asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other  establishes standards for the amortization of acquired intangible assets and impairment assessment of goodwill 
we have million related to acquisitions of insurance books of business which are subject to amortization 
the million in recorded goodwill is primarily related to the acquisition of huntington national bank branches that occurred in and the acquisition of insurance books of business in that are not subject to periodic amortization 
goodwill arising from business combinations represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements in the business acquired 
goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
impairment testing requires that the fair value of each of first united corporation s reporting units be compared to the carrying amount of its net assets  including goodwill 
if the estimated current fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  no additional testing is required and an impairment loss is not recorded 
otherwise  additional testing is performed  and to the extent such additional testing results in a conclusion that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss is recognized 
our goodwill relates to the value inherent in the banking business  and that value is dependent upon our ability to provide quality  cost effective services in a highly competitive local market 
this ability relies upon continuing investments in processing systems  the development of value added service features and the ease of use of our services 
as such  goodwill value is supported ultimately by revenue that is driven by the volume of business transacted 
a decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth or the inability to deliver cost effective services over sustained periods can lead to impairment of goodwill  which could adversely impact earnings in future periods 
asc topic requires an annual evaluation of goodwill for impairment 
the determination of whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant judgments and estimates 
throughout  consistent with first united corporation s peer group  the shares of first united corporation common stock traded below its book value 
at december   first united corporation s stock price was significantly below its tangible book value 
management believed that these circumstances could indicate the possibility of impairment 
accordingly  management consulted a third party valuation specialist to assist it with the determination of the fair value of first united corporation  considering both the market approach guideline public company method and the income approach discounted future benefits method 
due to the illiquidity in the common stock and the adverse conditions surrounding the banking industry  reliance was placed on the income approach in determining the fair value of first united corporation 
the income approach is a discounted cash flow analysis that is determined by adding i the present value  which is a representation of the current value of a sum that is to be received some time in the future  of the estimated net income  net of dividends paid out  that first united corporation could generate over the next five years and ii the present value of a terminal value  which is a representation of the current value of an entity at a specified time in the future 
the terminal value was calculated using both a price to tangible book multiple method and a capitalization method and the more conservative of the two was utilized in the fair value calculation 
significant assumptions used in the above methods include net income from first united corporation s forward five year operating budget  incorporating conservative growth and mix assumptions  a discount rate of based on the most recent 
third quarter of cost of capital report from morningstar ibbotson associates for the commercial banking sector adjusted for a size and risk premium of basis points  a price to tangible book multiple of  which was the median multiple of commercial bank mergers and acquisitions during for selling banks and holding companies with non performing assets to average assets between and  as provided by sheshunoff co  and a capitalization rate of discount rate of adjusted for a conservative growth rate of 
the resulting fair value of the income approach resulted in the fair value of first united corporation exceeding the carrying value by 
management stressed the assumptions used in the analysis to provide additional support for the derived value 
this stress testing showed that i the discount rate could increase to before the excess would be eliminated in the tangible multiple method  and ii the assumption of the tangible book multiple could decline to and still result in a fair value in excess of book value 
based on the results of the evaluation  management concluded that the recorded value of goodwill at december  was not impaired 
however  future changes in strategy and or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded asset balances 
management will continue to evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and as events occur or circumstances change 
accounting for income taxes first united corporation accounts for income taxes by recording deferred income taxes that reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
management exercises significant judgment in the evaluation of the amount and timing of the recognition of the resulting tax assets and liabilities 
the judgments and estimates required for the evaluation are updated based upon changes in business factors and the tax laws 
a valuation allowance is recognized to reduce any deferred tax assets that based upon available information  it is more likely than not all  or any portion  of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
assessing the need for  and amount of  a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets requires significant judgment and analysis of evidence regarding realization of the deferred tax assets 
in most cases  the realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and generating a sufficient level of taxable income in future periods  which can be difficult to predict 
our largest deferred tax assets involve differences related to all and unrealized losses on investment securities 
given the nature of our deferred tax assets  management determined no valuation allowances were needed at december  or december  except for a state valuation allowance for certain state deferred tax assets associated with our parent company 
management expects that first united corporation s adherence to the required accounting guidance may result in increased volatility in quarterly and annual effective income tax rates because of changes in judgment or measurement including changes in actual and forecasted income before taxes  tax laws and regulations  and tax planning strategies 
other than temporary impairment of investment securities securities available for sale securities available for sale are stated at fair value  with the unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  reported in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss component in shareholders equity 
the amortized cost of debt securities classified as available for sale is adjusted for amortization of premiums to the first call date  if applicable  or to maturity  and for accretion of discounts to maturity  or in the case of mortgage backed securities  over the estimated life of the security 
such amortization and accretion  plus interest and dividends  are included in interest income from investments 
gains and losses on the sale of securities are recorded using the specific identification method 
management systematically evaluates securities for impairment on a quarterly basis 
based upon application of accounting guidance for subsequent measurement in asc topic section  management assesses whether i it has the intent to sell a security being evaluated and ii it is more likely than not that first united corporation will be required to sell the security prior to its anticipated recovery 
if neither applies  then declines in the fair values of securities below their cost that are considered other than temporary declines are split into two components 
the first is the loss attributable to declining credit quality 
credit losses are recognized in earnings as realized losses in the period in which the impairment determination is made 
the second component consists of all other losses  which are recognized in other comprehensive loss 
in estimating otti losses  management considers a the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  b adverse conditions specifically related to the security  an industry  or a geographic area  c the historic and implied volatility of the fair value of the security  d changes in the rating of the security by a rating agency  e recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date  f failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principal payments  and g the payment structure of the debt security and the likelihood of the issuer being able to make payments that increase in the future 
management also monitors cash flow projections for securities that are considered beneficial interests under the guidance of asc subtopic  investments other beneficial interests in securitized financial assets  asc section 
this process is described more fully in the section of the consolidated balance sheet review entitled investment securities 
fair value of investments we have determined the fair value of our investment securities in accordance with the requirements of asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements 
we measure the fair market values of our investments based on the fair value hierarchy established in topic the determination of fair value of investments and other assets is discussed further in note to the consolidated financial statements 
pension plan assumptions our pension plan costs are calculated using actuarial concepts  as discussed within the requirements of asc topic  compensation retirement benefits 
pension expense and the determination of our projected pension liability are based upon two critical assumptions the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets 
we evaluate each of these critical assumptions annually 
other assumptions impact the determination of pension expense and the projected liability including the primary employee demographics  such as retirement patterns  employee turnover  mortality rates  and estimated employer compensation increases 
these factors  along with the critical assumptions  are carefully reviewed by management each year in consultation with our pension plan consultants and actuaries 
further information about our pension plan assumptions  the plan s funded status  and other plan information is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
other than as discussed above  management does not believe that any material changes in our critical accounting policies have occurred since december  adoption of new accounting standards and effects of new accounting pronouncements note to the consolidated financial statements discusses new accounting pronouncements that  when adopted  could affect our future consolidated financial statements 
consolidated statement of income review net interest income net interest income is our largest source of operating revenue 
net interest income is the difference between the interest earned on interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities 
for analytical and discussion purposes  net interest income is adjusted to an fte basis to facilitate performance comparisons between taxable and tax exempt assets by increasing tax exempt income by an amount equal to the federal income taxes that would have been paid if this income were taxable at the statutorily applicable rate 
the table below summarizes net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis for the and dollars in thousands interest income   interest expense   net interest income   net interest margin net interest income on an fte basis decreased million during the year ended december  over the same period in due to an million decrease in interest income  which was partially offset by an million decrease in interest expense 
the decrease in net interest income resulted primarily from a lower level of loans and the lower interest rate environment in when compared to average interest earning assets decreased by million during the average yield on our average earning assets increased slightly to at december  from at december  this increase was due primarily to our strategy to deploy excess liquidity  invested at lower rates  to repay brokered and wholesale funding at their stated maturities rather than renew 
interest expense decreased during when compared to due to an overall reduction in interest rates paid on time deposits  driven by our decision to provide special rates only to full relationship customers  as well as lower balances and the shorter duration of the portfolio 
the overall decrease of million in average interest bearing liabilities in when compared to decreased the average rate paid from at december  to at december  as shown below  the composition of total interest income between and reflects a slight shift toward interest and fees on loans from investment securities

provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses was million for the year ended december   compared to million for fiscal year the lower provision for loan losses resulted primarily from stabilization in our total rolling historical loss rates and qualitative factors utilized in the determination of the all and stabilization in the level of classified assets 
approximately 
million of the lower provision for was related to the sale of million of our indirect auto portfolio in the second quarter management strives to ensure that the all reflects a level commensurate with the risk inherent in our loan portfolio 
other operating income the following table shows the major components of other operating income for the past two years  exclusive of net gains losses  and the percentage changes during these years dollars in thousands change service charges on deposit accounts   other service charge income debit card income   trust department income   insurance commissions   bank owned life insurance boli   brokerage commissions other income total other operating income   as the table above illustrates  other operating income decreased by 
million in when compared to  exclusive of net losses 
the decline in service charges on deposit accounts was due primarily to a reduction in nsf fees  increased charge off overdrafts and the new overdraft regulation implemented in august as a result of the dodd frank act 
the creation of the consumer protection bureau and its proposed regulation of overdraft fees and interchange fees could have a material and adverse impact on our future service charge income 
at this time  management cannot predict whether and when this regulation will be finalized and  if so  the extent to which it will reduce service charge income 
we also experienced decreases in other income such as fee income from our investments in maryland and west virginia title companies 
debit card income increased due to increased consumer spending and higher customer awareness of our rewards program 
insurance commissions decreased in when compared to due primarily to reduced premiums 
trust department income increased during when compared to due to a slight increase in assets under management and the fees received on those account  and increased fees on estate administration 
assets under management were million and million for and  respectively 
brokerage commissions also increased during by when compared to other operating expense other operating expense for decreased by million when compared to the following table shows the major components of other operating expense for the past two years and the percentage changes during these years dollars in thousands change salaries and employee benefits   other expenses   fdic premiums   equipment   occupancy   data processing   professional services   other real estate owned expense miscellaneous loan fees total other operating expense   the million decrease in salaries and employee benefits during when compared to resulted primarily from a reduction of full time equivalent employees through attrition and reduced service costs in the pension plan 
professional services expenses increased by due primarily to increases in legal and consulting expenses 
other expenses decreased by due primarily to decreases in marketing  postage and contract labor expenses 
fdic premiums decreased as a result of reduced balances in deposits and a change in the deposit mix 
the reduction in equipment expense resulted from a decrease in depreciation 
other real estate owned expenses increased due primarily to an increase in other real estate owned properties in miscellaneous loan fees increased from to due primarily to an increase in problem loans 
applicable income taxes due to improved operating results in  we recognized a smaller net tax benefit of 
million in  compared to a net tax benefit of million in the decrease resulted primarily from the change in earnings  from a net loss in to net income for the net tax benefit in resulted primarily from the million non cash otti charges on our investment portfolio and the increased loan loss provision 
see note to the consolidated financial statements under the heading income taxes for a detailed analysis of our deferred tax assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance has been provided for the million in state tax loss carry forwards included in deferred tax assets  which will expire commencing in we have concluded that no valuation allowance is necessary for our remaining federal and state net deferred tax assets at december   as it is more likely than not that they will be realized based on the following the expected reversal of all but million of the total million of deferred tax liabilities at december  in such a manner so as to substantially utilize the dollar for dollar impact against the deferred tax assets at december   for the remaining excess deferred tax assets that will not be utilized by the reversal of deferred tax liabilities  our expected future income will be sufficient to utilize the deferred tax assets as they reverse or before any net operating loss  if created  would expire  and tax planning strategies that can provide both one time increases to taxable income of up to approximately million and recurring annual decreases in unfavorable permanent items 
we will need to generate future taxable income of approximately million to fully utilize the net deferred tax assets in the years in which they are expected to reverse 
management estimates that we can fully utilize the deferred tax assets in approximately seven years based on the historical pre tax income and forecasts of estimated future pre tax income as adjusted for permanent book to tax differences 
consolidated balance sheet review overview our total assets were billion at december   representing a decrease of million from assets at december  the decrease resulted from a strategic decision to right size our balance sheet to better reflect our current capital levels 
the total interest earning asset mix at december  shows a slight increase in the percentage of loans and investments and a decline in cash and cash equivalents as a percentage of total assets from to these changes resulted from the implementation of our strategy to use our excess liquidity to repay  rather than renew  brokered and wholesale funding obligations at their stated maturities during the year 
the mix for each year is illustrated below year end percentage of total assets cash and cash equivalents net loans investments the year end total liability mix has remained consistent during the two year period as illustrated below 
year end percentage of total liabilities total deposits total borrowings loan portfolio the bank is actively engaged in originating loans to customers primarily in allegany county  frederick county  garrett county  and washington county in maryland  and in berkeley county  hardy county  mineral county  and monongalia county in west virginia  and the surrounding regions of west virginia and pennsylvania 
we have policies and procedures designed to mitigate credit risk and to maintain the quality of our loan portfolio 
these policies include underwriting standards for new credits as well as continuous monitoring and reporting policies for asset quality and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
these policies  coupled with ongoing training efforts  have provided effective checks and balances for the risk associated with the lending process 
lending authority is based on the type of the loan  and the experience of the lending officer 
commercial loans are collateralized primarily by real estate and  to a lesser extent  equipment and vehicles 
unsecured commercial loans represent an insignificant portion of total commercial loans 
residential mortgage loans are collateralized by the related property 
generally  a residential mortgage loan exceeding a specified internal loan to value ratio requires private mortgage insurance 
installment loans are typically collateralized  with loan to value ratios which are established based on the financial condition of the borrower 
we will also make unsecured consumer loans to qualified borrowers meeting our underwriting standards 
additional information about our loans and underwriting policies can be found in item of part i of this annual report under the heading banking products and services 
table sets forth the composition of our loan portfolio 
historically  our policy has been to make the majority of our loan commitments in our market areas 
we had no foreign loans in our portfolio as of december for any of the years presented 
summary of loan portfolio table the following table presents the composition of our loan portfolio for the past five years in millions commercial real estate acquisition and development commercial and industrial residential mortgage consumer total loans    comparing december  to december   outstanding loans decreased by million  net of the sale of million of the indirect auto portfolio 
cre loans decreased million as a result of the payoff of several large loans  charge offs of loan balances and ongoing scheduled principal payments 
commercial and industrial c i loans increased million and residential mortgages declined million 
acquisition and development loans decreased million due primarily to principal repayments and charge offs 
the decrease in the residential mortgage portfolio was attributable to regularly scheduled principal payments on existing loans and management s decision to use secondary market outlets such as fannie mae for the majority of new  longer term  fixed rate residential loan originations 
the consumer portfolio declined million due primarily to the sale of million of retail installment contracts in our indirect auto loan portfolio and million of repayment activity in the indirect auto portfolio exceeded new production due to special financing offered by the automotive manufacturers  credit unions and certain large regional banks 
at december   approximately of the commercial loan portfolio was collateralized by real estate  compared to approximately at december  at december   adjustable interest rate loans made up of total loans  compared to at december  fixed interest rate loans made up of the total loan portfolio at december   compared to of total loans at december  comparing loans at december  to loans at december   our loan portfolio decreased million 
cre loans increased million  as management focused on growing the small business loan portfolio and as certain acquisition and development a d loans  which decreased million  were completed and transferred to permanent financing 
the a d category also declined due to charged off balances  foreclosures  and working some troubled credits out of the bank 
commercial and industrial loans declined million and residential mortgage declined million 
the decrease in the residential mortgage portfolio was attributable to the increased amount of loan refinancing that were occurring as consumers sought long term fixed rate loans 
we do not retain these long term fixed rate loans  but use secondary market and fannie mae outlets to satisfy these loan requests 
the consumer portfolio declined million as repayment activity in the indirect auto portfolio exceeded new production resulting from the continued slowdown in economic activity and management s decision not to compete with the special financing offered by the automotive manufacturers 
the following table sets forth the maturities  based upon contractual dates  for selected loan categories as of december  maturities of loan portfolio at december  table in thousands maturing within one year after one but within five years maturing after five years total commercial real estate    acquisition and development    commercial and industrial    residential mortgage     consumer     total loans     classified by sensitivity to change in interest rates fixed interest rate loans    adjustable interest rate loans    total loans     management monitors the performance and credit quality of the loan portfolio by analyzing the age of the portfolio as determined by the length of time a recorded payment is past due 
a loan is considered to be past due when a payment has not been received for days past its contractual due date 
for all loan segments  the accrual of interest is discontinued when principal or interest is delinquent for days or more unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
all non accrual loans are considered to be impaired 
interest payments received on non accrual loans are applied as a reduction of the loan principal balance

interest income not recognized as a result of placing loans on non accrual status was million  and there was no interest income recognized on these loans during performing loans considered to be impaired including performing troubled debt restructurings  or tdrs  as defined and identified by management  amounted to million at december  and million at december  loans are identified as impaired when  based on current information and events  management determines that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to contractual terms 
these loans consist primarily of a d loans and cre loans 
the fair values are generally determined based upon independent third party appraisals of the collateral or discounted cash flows based upon the expected proceeds 
specific allocations have been made where management believes there is insufficient collateral to repay the loan balance if liquidated and there is no secondary source of repayment available 
the level of performing impaired loans other than performing tdrs decreased million during the year ended december  two cre loans totaling million were removed from impaired status due to satisfactory payment performance 
three a d loans  two cre loans and one residential mortgage loan  totaling million  that were previously deemed to be performing impaired loans were modified and classified as performing tdrs 
one million a d loan that was previously deemed to be a performing impaired loan was transferred to non performing  and net principal repayments totaling million were received on other loans deemed to be performing impaired loans during the year 
management will continue to monitor all loans that have been removed from an impaired status and take appropriate steps to ensure that satisfactory performance is sustained

interest income not recognized due to rate modifications of tdrs was

million in allowance for loan losses the all is maintained to absorb losses from the loan portfolio 
the all is based on management s continuing evaluation of the quality of the loan portfolio  assessment of current economic conditions  diversification and size of the portfolio  adequacy of collateral  past and anticipated loss experience  and the amount of non performing loans 
the all is also based on estimates  and actual losses will vary from current estimates 
these estimates are reviewed quarterly  and as adjustments  either positive or negative  become necessary  a corresponding increase or decrease is made in the all 
the methodology used to determine the adequacy of the all is consistent with prior years 
an estimate for probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments  such as letters of credit and binding but unfunded loan commitments is also prepared 
this estimate is computed in a manner similar to the methodology described above  adjusted for the probability of actually funding the commitment 
the all decreased to million at december  from million at december  the provision for loan losses for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for the year ended december  net charge offs declined to million at december  from million at december  included in the net charge offs for the year ended december  were partial charge offs of million for two large cre loans and million for one other a d loan 
the decrease in the provision for loan losses from to resulted from management s analysis of the adequacy of the loan loss reserve  declining loan balances  charge offs and improving economic conditions as noted by the federal reserve 
the sale of million of the indirect auto portfolio  which released 
million in provision expense  was a contributing factor to the lower provision expense 
the ratio of the all to loans outstanding as of december  was  compared to as of december  the decrease was due to a focused effort by management to recognize potential problem loans  charge off potentially uncollectible balances  and record specific allocations and adjust qualitative factors to reflect the current quality of the loan portfolio 
the ratio of net charge offs to average loans for the year ended december  totaled  compared to for the year ended december  relative to december   all segments of loans  with the exception of cre loans  showed improvement 
the net charge off ratio for cre loans as of december  was  compared to

million 
other improvements in the levels of past due loans were attributable to a combination of a slowly improving economy and vigorous collection efforts by the bank 
non accrual loans totaled million as of december   compared to million as of december  non accrual loans which have been subject to a partial charge off totaled million as of december   compared to million as of december  management believes that the all at december  is adequate to provide for probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
amounts that will be recorded for the provision for loan losses in future periods will depend upon trends in the loan balances  including the composition of the loan portfolio  changes in loan quality and loss experience trends  potential recoveries on previously charged off loans and changes in other qualitative factors 
management also applies interest rate risk  collateral value and debt service sensitivity analyses to the cre loan portfolio and obtains new appraisals on specific loans under defined parameters to assist in the determination of the periodic provision for loan losses 
the all increased to million at december  from million at december  the provision for loan losses remained stable for the year ended december  at million  compared to million for fiscal year net charge offs increased to million at december  from million at december  as part of our loan review process  management noted an increase in foreclosures and bankruptcies in the geographic areas in which we operate 
additionally  the current economic environment caused a decline in real estate sales 
consequently  we closely reviewed and applied sensitivity analyses to collateral values to more adequately measure potential future losses 
where necessary  we obtained new appraisals on collateral 
specific allocations of the all were provided in those instances where we believed that losses might occur 
as of december   the balance of the all was equal to of total loans

as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we measure fair market values based on the fair value hierarchy established in asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures 
the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level measurements and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level measurements 
level prices or valuation techniques require inputs that are both significant to the valuation assumptions and are not readily observable in the market ie supported with little or no market activity 
these level instruments are valued based on both observable and unobservable inputs derived from the best available data  some of which is internally developed  and considers risk premiums that a market participant would require 
approximately million of the available for sale portfolio was valued using level pricing and had net unrealized gains of million at december  the remaining million of the securities available for sale represents the entire cdo portfolio  which was valued using significant unobservable inputs  or level pricing 
the million in unrealized losses associated with this portfolio relates to pooled trust preferred securities that comprise the cdo portfolio 
unrealized losses of million represent non credit related otti charges on of the securities  while million of unrealized losses relates to five securities which have no credit related otti 
the unrealized losses on these securities are primarily attributable to continued depression in the marketability and liquidity associated with cdos 
the following table provides a summary of the trust preferred securities in the cdo portfolio and the credit status of the securities as of december  
logo 
jpg 
the terms of the debentures underlying trust preferred securities allow the issuer of the debentures to defer interest payments for up to quarters  and  in such case  the terms of the related trust preferred securities require their issuers to contemporaneously defer dividend payments 
the issuers of the trust preferred securities in our investment portfolio have defaulted and or deferred payments  ranging from to of the total collateral balances underlying the securities 
the securities were designed to include structural features that provide investors with credit enhancement or support to provide default protection by subordinated tranches 
these features include over collateralization of the notes or subordination  excess interest or spread which will redirect funds in situations where collateral is insufficient  and a specified order of principal payments 
there are securities in our portfolio that are under collateralized  which does represent additional stress on our tranche 
however  in these cases  the terms of the securities require excess interest to be redirected from subordinate tranches as credit support  which provides additional support to our investment 
management systematically evaluates securities for impairment on a quarterly basis 
based upon application of topic asc section  management must assess whether i it has the intent to sell the security and ii it is more likely than not that first united corporation will be required to sell the security prior to its anticipated recovery 
if neither applies  then declines in the fair value of securities below their cost that are considered other than temporary declines are split into two components 
the first is the loss attributable to declining credit quality 
credit losses are recognized in earnings as realized losses in the period in which the impairment determination is made 
the second component consists of all other losses 
the other losses are recognized in other comprehensive income 
in estimating otti charges  management considers a the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  b adverse conditions specifically related to the security  an industry  or a geographic area  c the historic and implied volatility of the security  d changes in the rating of a security by a rating agency  e recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date  f failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest payments  and g the payment structure of the debt security and the likelihood of the issuer being able to make payments that increase in the future 
due to the duration and the significant market value decline in the pooled trust preferred securities held in our portfolio  we performed more extensive testing on these securities for purposes of evaluating whether or not an otti has occurred 
the market for these securities as of december  is not active and markets for similar securities are also not active 
the inactivity was evidenced first by a significant widening of the bid ask spread in the brokered markets in which these securities trade and then by a significant decrease in the volume of trades relative to historical levels 
the new issue market is also inactive  as no new cdos have been issued since there are currently very few market participants who are willing to transact for these securities 
the market values for these securities  or any securities other than those issued or guaranteed by the treasury  are very depressed relative to historical levels 
therefore  in the current market  a low market price for a particular bond may only provide evidence of stress in the credit markets in general rather than being an indicator of credit problems with a particular issue 
given the conditions in the current debt markets and the absence of observable transactions in the secondary and new issue markets  management has determined that i the few observable transactions and market quotations that are available are not reliable for the purpose of obtaining fair value at december   ii an income valuation approach technique ie present value that maximizes the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizes the use of observable inputs will be equally or more representative of fair value than a market approach  and iii the cdo segment is appropriately classified within level of the valuation hierarchy because management determined that significant adjustments were required to determine fair value at the measurement date 
management utilizes an independent third party to prepare both the evaluations of otti and the fair value determinations for our cdo portfolio 
management believes that there were no material differences in the impairment evaluations and pricing between december  and december  the approach of the third party to determine fair value involved several steps  including detailed credit and structural evaluation of each piece of collateral in each bond  default  recovery and prepayment amortization probabilities for each piece of collateral in the bond  and discounted cash flow modeling 
the discount rate methodology used by the third party combines a baseline current market yield for comparable corporate and structured credit products with adjustments based on evaluations of the differences found in structure and risks associated with actual and projected credit performance of each cdo being valued 
currently  there is an active and liquid trading market only for stand alone trust preferred securities 
therefore  adjustments to the baseline discount rate are also made to reflect the additional leverage found in structured instruments 
based upon a review of credit quality and the cash flow tests performed by the independent third party  management determined that one security had credit related otti during as a result  we recorded  in credit related non cash otti charges on the cdo security in earnings for the year ended december  management does not intend to sell this security nor is it more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovery 
the risk based capital regulations require banks to set aside additional capital for securities that are rated below investment grade 
securities rated one level below investment grade require a risk weighting 
additional methods are applicable to securities rated more than one level below investment grade 
management believes that  as of december   we maintain sufficient capital and liquidity to cover the additional capital requirements of these securities and future operating expenses 
additionally  we do not anticipate any material commitments or expected outlays of capital in the near term

the decrease in time deposits greater than  was primarily due to the repayment of million in brokered certificates of deposit and million of maturities in our cdars product 
although brokered deposits are at very low rates in the current environment  management made the decision to right size the balance sheet by using cash to repay brokered deposits and to allow certificates of deposit for non relationship customers to run off 
the decline in deposits during was due to the strategic plan to reduce cash levels by paying off certain brokered deposits  fhlb advances and public money at their maturities

as of december   we had additional borrowing capacity with the fhlb totaling million  an additional million of unused lines of credit with various financial institutions  million of an unused secured line of credit with the federal reserve bank and approximately million through wholesale money market funds 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details about our borrowings and additional borrowing capacity  which is incorporated herein by reference 
capital resources the bank and first united corporation are subject to risk based capital regulations  which were adopted and are monitored by federal banking regulators 
these regulations are used to evaluate capital adequacy and require an analysis of an institution s asset risk profile and off balance sheet exposures  such as unused loan commitments and stand by letters of credit 
the regulations require that a portion of total capital be tier capital  consisting of common shareholders equity  the qualifying portion of trust issued preferred securities  and perpetual preferred stock  less goodwill and certain other deductions 
the remaining capital  or tier capital  consists of subordinated debt  mandatory convertible debt  the remaining portion of trust issued preferred securities  grandfathered senior debt and the all  subject to certain limitations 
under the risk based capital regulations  banking organizations are required to maintain a minimum for well capitalized banks total risk based capital ratio total qualifying capital divided by risk weighted assets  including a tier ratio of for well capitalized banks 
the risk based capital rules have been further supplemented by a leverage ratio  defined as tier i capital divided by average assets  after certain adjustments 
the minimum leverage ratio is for well capitalized banks for banking organizations that do not anticipate significant growth and have well diversified risk including no undue interest rate risk exposure  excellent asset quality  high liquidity and good earnings 
other banking organizations not in this category are expected to have ratios of at least  depending on their particular condition and growth plans 
regulators may require higher capital ratios when warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profile of a given banking organization 
in the current regulatory environment  banking organizations must stay well capitalized in order to receive favorable regulatory treatment on acquisition and other expansion activities and favorable risk based deposit insurance assessments 
our capital policy establishes guidelines meeting these regulatory requirements and takes into consideration current or anticipated risks as well as potential future growth opportunities 
at december   first united corporation s total risk based capital ratio was and the bank s total risk based capital ratio was  both of which were well above the regulatory minimum of 
the total risk based capital ratios of first united corporation and the bank for year end were and  respectively 
as of december   the most recent notification from the regulators categorizes first united corporation and the bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding regulatory capital ratios

information about the terms of these securities is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the terms of the series a preferred stock call for the payment  if declared by the board of directors of first united corporation  of a quarterly cash dividend on february th  may th  august th and november th of each year 
at the request of the reserve bank  first united corporation deferred the payment of cash dividends on the series a preferred stock beginning with the payment that was due on november  as of december   this deferral election remained in effect and dividends of 
million per quarterly dividend period continue to accrue 
first united corporation will be required to pay all accrued and unpaid dividends if and when the board of directors declares and pays the next quarterly cash dividend 
management cannot predict whether or when the board of directors will resume quarterly cash dividends on the series a preferred stock 
first united corporation s ability to make dividend payments in the future will depend primarily on our earnings in future periods 
on december   also at the request of the reserve bank  the board of directors of first united corporation elected to defer quarterly interest payments under the tps debentures beginning with the payment that was due in march as of december   this deferral election remained in effect and cumulative deferred interest was approximately million  which has been fully accrued and must be paid in full when the board of directors elects to terminate the deferral 
first united corporation s ability to resume quarterly interest payments will depend primarily on our earnings in future periods 
accordingly  no assurance can be given as to if or when first united corporation will resume the payment of interest under the tps debentures 
in connection with  and as a result of  the aforementioned deferrals  the board of directors of first united corporation voted to suspend the declaration of quarterly cash dividends on the common stock until further notice 
the payment of cash dividends on the common stock is at the discretion of the board of directors and is dependent on our earnings in future periods 
in addition  cash dividends on the common stock may be paid only if all accrued and unpaid interest due under the tps debentures and all accrued and unpaid dividends due under the series a preferred stock have been paid in full 
there can be no assurance as to if or when first united corporation will resume the payment of cash dividends on the common stock 
liquidity management liquidity is a financial institution s capability to meet customer demands for deposit withdrawals and pay its other obligations while funding all credit worthy loans 
the factors that determine the institution s liquidity are reliability and stability of core deposits  cash flow structure and pledging status of investments  and potential for unexpected loan demand 
we actively manage our liquidity position through weekly meetings of a sub committee of executive management  known as the treasury sub committee  which looks forward months at day intervals 
the measurement is based upon the projection of funds sold or purchased position  along with ratios and trends developed to measure dependence on purchased funds and core growth 
monthly reviews by management and quarterly reviews by the asset and liability committee under prescribed policies and procedures are designed to ensure that we will maintain adequate levels of available funds 
it is our policy to manage our affairs so that liquidity needs are fully satisfied through normal bank operations 
that is  the bank will manage its liquidity to minimize the need to make unplanned sales of assets or to borrow funds under emergency conditions 
the bank will use funding sources where the interest cost is relatively insensitive to market changes in the short run periods of one year or less to satisfy operating cash needs 
the remaining normal funding will come from interest sensitive liabilities  either deposits or borrowed funds 
when the marginal cost of needed wholesale funding is lower than the cost of raising this funding in the retail markets  the bank may supplement retail funding with external funding sources such as unsecured fed funds lines of credit with upstream correspondent banks ftn financial  m t bank  atlantic central banker s bank  community banker s bank  secured advances with the fhlb of atlanta  which are collateralized by eligible one to four family residential mortgage portfolio  home equity lines of credit portfolio  cre loan portfolio  and various securities 
cash may also be pledged as collateral  secured line of credit with the fed discount window for use in borrowing funds up to days  using municipal securities as collateral  brokered deposits  including cds and money market funds  provide a method to generate deposits quickly 
these deposits are strictly rate driven but often provide the most cost effective means of funding growth  and one way buy cdars funding a form of brokered deposits that has become a viable supplement to brokered deposits obtained directly 
during  management implemented a strategic plan to utilize excess liquidity to repay brokered deposits  non relationship certificates of deposit and wholesale fhlb advances at their stated maturities 
reduction in these liabilities  deemed to be volatile funding by regulatory definition  should not have an impact on our levels of liquidity 
management believes that we have adequate liquidity available to respond to current and anticipated liquidity demands and is unaware of any trends or demands  commitments  events or uncertainties that will materially affect our ability to maintain liquidity at satisfactory levels 
market risk and interest sensitivity our primary market risk is interest rate fluctuation 
interest rate risk results primarily from the traditional banking activities that we engage in  such as gathering deposits and extending loans 
many factors  including economic and financial conditions  movements in interest rates and consumer preferences affect the difference between the interest earned on our assets and the interest paid on our liabilities 
interest rate sensitivity refers to the degree that earnings will be impacted by changes in the prevailing level of interest rates 
interest rate risk arises from mismatches in the repricing or maturity characteristics between interest bearing assets and liabilities 
management seeks to minimize fluctuating net interest margins  and to enhance consistent growth of net interest income through periods of changing interest rates 
management uses interest sensitivity gap analysis and simulation models to measure and manage these risks 
the interest rate sensitivity gap analysis assigns each interest earning asset and interest bearing liability to a time frame reflecting its next repricing or maturity date 
the differences between total interest sensitive assets and liabilities at each time interval represent the interest sensitivity gap for that interval 
a positive gap generally indicates that rising interest rates during a given interval will increase net interest income  as more assets than liabilities will reprice 
a negative gap position would benefit us during a period of declining interest rates 
throughout and  we shifted our focus from a shorter duration balance sheet to a more neutral to slightly asset sensitive position  as we anticipated a rising interest rate environment in the future 
as of december   we were slightly asset sensitive 
our interest rate risk management goals are ensure that the board of directors and senior management will provide effective oversight and ensure that risks are adequately identified  measured  monitored and controlled  enable dynamic measurement and management of interest rate risk  select strategies that optimize our ability to meet our long range financial goals while maintaining interest rate risk within policy limits established by the board of directors  use both income and market value oriented techniques to select strategies that optimize the relationship between risk and return  and establish interest rate risk exposure limits for fluctuation in net interest income nii  net income and economic value of equity 
in order to manage interest sensitivity risk  management formulates guidelines regarding asset generation and pricing  funding sources and pricing  and off balance sheet commitments 
these guidelines are based on management s outlook regarding future interest rate movements  the state of the regional and national economy  and other financial and business risk factors 
management uses computer simulations to measure the effect on net interest income of various interest rate scenarios 
key assumptions used in the computer simulations include cash flows and maturities of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities  changes in asset volumes and pricing  and management s capital plans 
this modeling reflects interest rate changes and the related impact on net interest income over specified periods 
we evaluate the effect of a change in interest rates of basis points to basis points on both nii and net portfolio value npv economic value of equity eve 
we concentrate on nii rather than net income as long as nii remains the significant contributor to net income 
nii modeling allows management to view how changes in interest rates will affect the spread between the yield paid on assets and the cost of deposits and borrowed funds 
unlike traditional gap modeling  nii modeling takes into account the different degree to which installments in the same repricing period will adjust to a change in interest rates 
it also allows the use of different assumptions in a falling versus a rising rate environment 
the period considered by the nii modeling is the next eight quarters 
npv eve modeling focuses on the change in the market value of equity 
npv eve is defined as the market value of assets less the market value of liabilities plus minus the market value of any off balance sheet positions 
by effectively looking at the present value of all future cash flows on or off the balance sheet  npv eve modeling takes a longer term view of interest rate risk 
this complements the shorter term view of the nii modeling 
measures of nii at risk produced by simulation analysis are indicators of an institution s short term performance in alternative rate environments 
these measures are typically based upon a relatively brief period  usually one year 
they do not necessarily indicate the long term prospects or economic value of the institution 
based on the simulation analysis performed at december  and  management estimated the following changes in net interest income  assuming the indicated rate changes dollars in thousands basis point increase   basis point increase   basis point increase   basis point increase   basis point increase this estimate is based on assumptions that may be affected by unforeseeable changes in the general interest rate environment and any number of unforeseeable factors 
rates on different assets and liabilities within a single maturity category adjust to changes in interest rates to varying degrees and over varying periods of time 
the relationships between lending rates and rates paid on purchased funds are not constant over time 
management can respond to current or anticipated market conditions by lengthening or shortening the bank s sensitivity through loan repricings or changing its funding mix 
the rate of growth in interest free sources of funds will influence the level of interest sensitive funding sources 
in addition  the absolute level of interest rates will affect the volume of earning assets and funding sources 
as a result of these limitations  the interest sensitive gap is only one factor to be considered in estimating the net interest margin 
impact of inflation our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature  and as such  future changes in prices do not affect the obligations to pay or receive fixed and determinable amounts of money 
during inflationary periods  monetary assets lose value in terms of purchasing power and monetary liabilities have corresponding purchasing power gains 
the concept of purchasing power is not an adequate indicator of the impact of inflation on financial institutions because it does not incorporate changes in interest rates  which are an important determination of first united corporation s earnings
