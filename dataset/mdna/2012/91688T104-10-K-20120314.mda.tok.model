part item description of business corporate background uranerz energy corporation uranerz or the company was incorporated under the laws of the state of nevada on may  on july   we changed our name from carleton ventures corp 
to uranerz energy corporation 
our executive and operations office is located at east e street  po box  casper  wyoming usa our administrative office is located at suite west pender street  vancouver  british columbia  canada vc v the telephone number for our executive office is the telephone number for our administrative office is our common stock is traded on the nyse amex equities and the toronto stock exchange under the symbol urz and on the frankfurt stock exchange under the symbol ue 
history uranerz was relatively inactive from until when it acquired mineral prospecting permits in saskatchewan  mineral licenses in mongolia and mining claims and leases in wyoming 
the company commenced exploration in and has continued through in we filed uranium mining applications for a project in wyoming 
in we sold our mongolian properties and have terminated exploration in saskatchewan 
we continued to acquire additional mineral properties and conduct exploration drilling while pursuing mining permits in wyoming 
in we received regulatory approvals for the development of our first mine  the nichols ranch isr uranium project  and construction is in progress with completion expected in the last half of our business we are a us based uranium company focused on achieving near term commercial in situ recovery isr uranium production 
isr is a mining process that uses a leaching solution to dissolve uranium from sandstone uranium deposits  it is the generally accepted extraction technology used in the powder river basin area of wyoming isr comprised of world uranium production in 
we control a large strategic land position in the pumpkin buttes uranium mining district of the central powder river basin of wyoming  usa our management team has specialized expertise in the isr uranium mining method  and a record of licensing  constructing  and operating isr uranium projects 
we are principally focused on the development of our properties in the powder river basin area into commercial isr uranium mines 
our plan of operations is to bring two properties into production  the nichols ranch and hank units  together referred to as the nichols ranch isr uranium project  and continue the exploration and development of our other wyoming powder river basin properties 
in july we received the final authorizations required to allow us to begin construction of our nichols ranch isr uranium project 
we commenced construction of the facility described below and related infrastructure immediately thereafter  with a target completion date of late at the nichols ranch isr uranium project we expect to take our nichols ranch and hank units into production of uranium concentrate  which can be sold directly to utilities for processing into fuel used in nuclear electrical generating facilities 
a third project is in the license application preparation stage 
in march  we commenced preparation of the environmental permit and license applications for the jane dough unit  which is adjacent to the area currently being developed at the nichols ranch unit and will share its infrastructure 
jane dough includes the doughstick  south doughstick and north jane properties 
additional units may be added as we assess our geological data 
the mine plan for the nichols ranch isr uranium project now includes a facility at our nichols ranch unit and a second ion exchange uranium concentrating facility at our hank unit 
the initial production level from these two units is planned to be in the range of  to  pounds per year of uranium as uo the nichols ranch processing facility is licensed for a capacity of two million pounds per year of uranium as uo and is intended to process uranium bearing well field solutions from nichols ranch and from any additional satellite deposits that may be developed on our other powder river basin properties 
in november we signed a processing agreement with cameco resources cameco  a wholly owned wyoming subsidiary of cameco corporation  the world s largest publicly traded uranium company 
under the agreement we will deliver uranium loaded resin produced from the company s nichols ranch isr uranium project to cameco s smith ranch highland uranium mine for final processing into dried uranium concentrate packaged for shipping to a converter 
the processing of uranerz loaded resin at cameco s facility will not change the company s production plans as we will retain the regulatory and physical flexibility to install a full processing plant at the nichols ranch isr mine at a later date 
as a result of this agreement  uranerz will only install the ion exchange circuit and the well field makeup circuit at this time at the nichols ranch central processing plant 
cameco s smith ranch highland mine is located in the powder river basin approximately air miles south of uranerz nichols ranch isr uranium project 
the jane dough unit is compatible with this plan 
we plan to use the isr mining process whereby a leaching agent  which contains an oxidant such as oxygen with sodium bicarbonate commonly known as baking soda and carbon dioxide  is added to the native groundwater and injected through wells into the ore body in a sandstone aquifer to dissolve minerals containing uranium 
this solution is then pumped via other wells to the surface for processing into finished yellowcake product ready for sale to utilities requiring nuclear fuel for operations resulting in a cost efficient and  relative to other common mining methods  a more environmentally friendly mining process 
the isr mining process differs dramatically from conventional mining techniques in that isr mining leaves the rock matrix in place 
the isr technique avoids the movement and milling of rock and ore as well as mill tailing waste associated with more traditional mining methods 
in anticipation of receiving all the approvals necessary to begin production  we commenced a marketing program for conditional sales of uranium from our nichols ranch isr uranium project 
in july of we announced that we entered into a sales agreement with exelon generation company  llc for the sale of uranium over a five year period at defined pricing 
in august of we announced our second contract for the sale of uranium to a us utility also over five years  with a pricing structure that contains references to both spot and long term prices and includes floor and ceiling prices 
these long term contracts for the sale of uranium are with two of the largest nuclear utilities in the us these two agreements do not individually represent a substantial portion of our targeted uranium production and our business is not substantially dependent on these agreements 
recent corporate developments the following significant corporate developments occurred during our fiscal year ended december  we issued  common shares upon the exercise of stock options for gross cash proceeds of  we issued  common shares upon the exercise of common share purchase warrants for gross cash proceeds of  we continued our exploration program in wyoming see details under the section heading item description of properties we received the licensing and permitting approvals necessary to construct and operate isr uranium facilities on our nichols ranch and hank units  we continued the licensing and permitting process to construct and operate isr uranium facilities on our jane dough unit  we commenced construction of our nichols ranch isr uranium project  we increased the number of authorized common shares from million to million  we continued drilling exploration development activities on both our owned properties and our arkose properties  all in the powder river basin  and we added eight new employees for our construction program 
our focus during the fiscal year ended december  was on exploration in the powder river basin  licensing the jane dough unit  construction of a processing facility and installation of the environmental monitor and production wells for the first well field at the nichols ranch isr uranium project 
competition our industry is highly competitive 
we compete with other mining and exploration companies in connection with the acquisition of uranium mineral properties and the equipment  materials and personnel necessary to explore and develop such properties 
there is competition for the limited number of uranium acquisition opportunities  some of which is with other companies having substantially greater financial resources  staff and facilities than we do 
as a result  we may have difficulty acquiring attractive exploration properties  staking claims related to our properties  and exploring and developing our properties 
minerals exploration regulation our uranium mineral exploration and development activities are  and our production activities if and when they occur will be  subject to extensive laws and regulations governing exploration  development  production  exports  taxes  labor standards  occupational health  waste disposal  protection and remediation of the environment  protection of endangered and protected species  mine safety  toxic substances and other matters 
uranium minerals exploration is also subject to risks and liabilities associated with pollution of the environment and disposal of waste products occurring as a result of mineral exploration and production 
compliance with these laws and regulations may impose substantial costs on us and will subject us to significant potential liabilities 
changes in these regulations could require us to expend significant resources to comply with new laws or regulations or changes to current requirements and could have a material adverse effect on our business operations 
minerals exploration operations are subject to comprehensive regulation which may cause substantial delays or require capital outlays in excess of those anticipated  causing an adverse effect on our business operations 
minerals exploration operations are subject to federal and state laws relating to the protection of the environment  including laws regulating removal of natural resources from the ground and the discharge of materials into the environment 
minerals exploration operations are also subject to federal and state laws and regulations which seek to maintain health and safety standards by regulating the design and use of drilling methods and equipment 
various permits from government bodies are required for drilling operations to be conducted  no assurance can be given that such permits will be received 
environmental standards imposed by federal and state authorities may be changed and any such changes may have material adverse effects on our activities 
as of the date of this annual report  other than with respect to the posting of a performance bond  we have not been required to spend material amounts on compliance with environmental regulations 
however  we may be required to do so in future and this may affect our ability to expand or maintain our operations 
environmental regulation is discussed in further detail in the following section 
environmental regulation exploration  development and production activities are subject to certain environmental regulations which may prevent or delay the commencement or continuance of our operations 
in general  our exploration and production activities are subject to certain federal and state laws and regulations relating to environmental quality and pollution control 
such laws and regulations increase the costs of these activities and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuance of a given operation 
compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material effect on our operations or financial condition to date 
specifically  we are subject to legislation regarding emissions into the environment  water discharges  and storage and disposition of hazardous wastes 
in addition  legislation has been enacted which requires well and facility sites to be abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of state and federal authorities 
waste disposal the resource conservation and recovery act rcra  and comparable state statutes  affect minerals exploration and production activities by imposing regulations on the generation  transportation  treatment  storage  disposal and cleanup of hazardous wastes and on the disposal of non hazardous wastes 
under the auspices of the united states environmental protection agency the epa  the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of rcra  sometimes in conjunction with their own  more stringent requirements 
cercla the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla imposes joint and several liability for costs of investigation and remediation and for natural resource damages  without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  on certain classes of persons with respect to the release into the environment of substances designated under cercla as hazardous substances hazardous substances 
these classes of persons or potentially responsible parties include the current and certain past owners and operators of a facility or property where there is or has been a release or threat of release of a hazardous substance and persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at such a facility 
cercla also authorizes the epa and  in some cases  third parties to take actions in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover the costs of such action 
we may also in the future become an owner of facilities on which hazardous substances have been released by previous owners or operators 
we may in the future be responsible under cercla for all or part of the costs to clean up facilities or property at which such substances have been released  and for natural resource damages 
air emissions our operations are subject to state and federal regulations for the control of emissions of air pollution 
major sources of air pollutants are subject to more stringent  federally imposed permitting requirements 
administrative enforcement actions for failure to comply strictly with air pollution regulations or permits are generally resolved by payment of monetary fines and correction of any identified deficiencies 
alternatively  regulatory agencies could require us to forego construction  modification or operation of certain air emission sources 
clean water act the clean water act cwa imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of wastes  including mineral processing wastes  into waters of the united states  a term broadly defined 
permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants into federal waters 
the cwa provides for civil  criminal and administrative penalties for unauthorized discharges of hazardous substances and other pollutants 
it imposes substantial potential liability for the costs of removal or remediation associated with discharges of oil or hazardous substances 
state laws governing discharges to water also provide varying civil  criminal and administrative penalties  and impose liabilities in the case of a discharge of petroleum or its derivatives  or other hazardous substances  into state waters 
in addition  the epa has promulgated regulations that require us to obtain permits to discharge storm water runoff 
in the event of an unauthorized discharge of wastes  we may be liable for penalties and costs 
underground injection control uic permits the federal safe drinking water act creates a nationwide regulatory program protecting groundwater 
this act is administered by the epa 
however  to avoid the burden of dual federal and state or indian tribal regulation  the safe drinking water act allows for the uic permits issued by states and indian tribes determined eligible for treatment as states to satisfy the uic permit required under the safe drinking water act under two conditions 
first  the state s program must have been granted primacy 
second  the epa must have granted  upon request by the state  an aquifer exemption 
the epa may delay or decline to process the state s application if the epa questions the state s jurisdiction over the mine site
