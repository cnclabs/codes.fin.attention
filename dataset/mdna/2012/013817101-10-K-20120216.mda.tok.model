overview our business alcoa is the world leader in the production and management of primary aluminum  fabricated aluminum  and alumina combined  through its active and growing participation in all major aspects of the industry technology  mining  refining  smelting  fabricating  and recycling 
aluminum is a commodity that is traded on the london metal exchange lme and priced daily based on market supply and demand 
aluminum and alumina represent more than of alcoa s revenues  and the price of aluminum influences the operating results of alcoa 
nonaluminum products include precision castings and aerospace and industrial fasteners 
alcoa s products are used worldwide in aircraft  automobiles  commercial transportation  packaging  building and construction  oil and gas  defense  consumer electronics  and industrial applications 

table of contents alcoa is a global company operating in countries 
based upon the country where the point of sale occurred  the us and europe generated and  respectively  of alcoa s sales in in addition  alcoa has investments and operating activities in  among others  australia  brazil  china  guinea  iceland  russia  and saudi arabia  all of which present opportunities for substantial growth 
governmental policies  laws and regulations  and other economic factors  including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates  affect the results of operations in these countries 
management review of and outlook for the future at the end of  management had projected growth in global aluminum demand of for while demand started strong in the year  it weakened in the second half  resulting in an estimated actual growth rate of 
additionally  lme pricing levels declined steadily from the peak reached in mid  resulting in a more than decrease by the end of the year 
the company also faced demand destruction for aluminum end products in europe and significant headwinds for certain input costs during despite these challenges  the financial results of alcoa improved over  due in large part to the decisions made by management 
at the beginning of  management continued its previous actions from its two year cash sustainability program  which began in to achieve targets related to procurement efficiencies  overhead rationalization  and working capital improvements 
additionally  management planned to further improve alcoa s liquidity position by maintaining a consistent level of capital expenditures with that of  refinancing long term debt set to mature during  and contributing equity to satisfy a large portion of the company s obligation to its us pension plans 
the following financial information reflects some key metrics of alcoa s results sales of  a improvement over  income from continuing operations of  or per diluted share  an increase of compared to  total segment after tax operating income of  a improvement over  cash from operations of  in excess of  for the second consecutive year  capital expenditures of  under  for the second consecutive year  cash on hand at the end of the year of  in excess of  for the third consecutive year  increase in total debt of  but a decrease of  over the past three years  and debt to capital ratio of  consistent with the targeted range of to 
management is projecting continued growth increase of in the global consumption of primary aluminum in  but at a slower pace than china and india are expected to have double digit increases in aluminum demand while russia and brazil are expected to have to increases in aluminum consumption rates 
such growth  along with industry wide capacity curtailments  will result in demand exceeding supply for primary aluminum 
for alumina  growth in global consumption is estimated to be  and overall supply and demand are expected to be balanced 
management also anticipates improved market conditions for aluminum products in most major global end markets  particularly aerospace and automotive 
on the cost side  energy prices and certain raw materials are expected to continue to be a challenge 
management has established and is committed to achieving the following specific goals in producing additional savings over those realized in through from procurement  overhead  and working capital programs  generating positive cash flow from operations that will exceed capital spending  and maintaining a debt to capital ratio between and 

table of contents looking ahead over the next two to four years  management will continue to focus on its aggressive strategic targets established at the end of these targets include lowering alcoa s refining and smelting operations on the cost curve to the rd from th and st from st percentiles  respectively  by and driving revenue growth in the midstream increase of  and downstream increase of  operations by in conjunction with the revenue targets  management is committed to improving margins that will exceed historical levels in the midstream and downstream operations 
in  production significantly improved at the juruti bauxite mine development  nameplate capacity was achieved for the s o lu s refinery expansion  and a part of the estreito hydroelectric power project became operational 
these developments  along with the planned full or partial curtailment of kmt of smelting capacity in europe and the full startup of estreito  both expected to occur in  and the completion of the aluminum complex in saudi arabia by  will help improve the company s position on the cost curve 
the midstream and downstream operations both achieved margins that exceeded historical levels and approximately of the respective revenue growth targets in the midstream operations will continue to build on this success in  through continued volume growth in russia and china  including emerging markets like consumer electronics  and expansion of the rolling mill in davenport  ia to meet rising us automotive demand  due to changing emissions regulations 
the downstream operations will further their accomplishments in through continued innovative solutions to meet a wide range of customer needs 
results of operations earnings summary income from continuing operations attributable to alcoa for was  or per diluted share  compared with  or per share  in the improvement of in continuing operations was primarily due to the following higher realized prices for alumina and aluminum  stronger volumes in the midstream and downstream segments  net productivity improvements  and a net favorable change in mark to market derivative contracts  partially offset by higher input costs  net unfavorable foreign currency movements  higher income taxes due to better operating results  and additional restructuring charges 
income from continuing operations attributable to alcoa for was  or per share  compared with a loss from continuing operations of  or per share  in the improvement of  in continuing operations was primarily due to the following increases in realized prices for alumina and aluminum  ongoing net costs savings and productivity improvements across all segments  and the absence of both a charge associated with a european commission electricity pricing matter in italy and a loss on the sale of an equity investment  partially offset by net unfavorable foreign currency movements  higher energy costs  unfavorable changes in lifo last in  first out inventories  additional depreciation charges and operating costs for growth projects  and the absence of gains on the exchange of equity interests and on the acquisition of bauxite and refinery interests 
net income attributable to alcoa for was  or per share  compared with net income of  or per share  in  and a net loss of  or per share  in in  net income of included a loss from discontinued operations of  and in and  net income of and net loss of  included a loss from discontinued operations of and  respectively 
in march  management initiated a series of operational and financial actions to significantly improve alcoa s cost structure and liquidity 
operational actions included procurement efficiencies and overhead rationalization to reduce costs and working capital initiatives to yield significant cash improvements 
financial actions included a reduction in the quarterly common stock dividend from per share to per share  which began with the dividend paid on may   and the issuance of million shares of common stock and in convertible notes that collectively yielded  in net proceeds 
in january  management initiated further operational actions to not only maintain the procurement and overhead savings and working capital improvements achieved in  but to improve on them throughout also  a further reduction in capital expenditures was planned in order to achieve the level necessary to sustain operations without sacrificing the quality of alcoa s alumina and aluminum products 
in  management continued its previous actions to maintain the achieved procurement and overhead savings from the past two years and to further improve cash with working capital initiatives 
additionally  maintaining a level of capital expenditures consistent with that of was planned 
during  management plans to continue the actions from 
table of contents the past three years to achieve additional procurement and overhead savings  to further improve on working capital  and to maintain a consistent level of capital expenditures 
in late  management made the decision to reduce alcoa s aluminum and alumina production in response to the then global economic downturn 
as a result of this decision  reductions of kmt  or  of annualized output from alcoa s global smelting system were implemented includes previous curtailment at rockdale  tx in june 
accordingly  reductions in alumina output were also initiated with a plan to reduce production by  kmt per year across the global refining system 
the aluminum and alumina production curtailments were completed in early as planned 
smelters in rockdale kmt per year and tennessee kmt per year were fully curtailed while another kmt per year was partially curtailed at various other locations 
the refinery in point comfort  tx was partially curtailed by approximately  kmt per year between the end of and the beginning of kmt per year remains curtailed as of december  
in mid  further action became necessary resulting in the decision to fully curtail the massena east  ny smelter kmt per year and partially curtail the suralco suriname refinery kmt per year kmt per year remains curtailed as of december  
in  alcoa restarted the following previously curtailed production capacity in the us massena east kmt per year  wenatchee  wa kmt per year  and ferndale  wa intalco kmt per year kmt more than previously planned 
these restarts increased aluminum production by approximately kmt during and are expected to increase aluminum production by kmt on an annual basis in and beyond and occurred to help meet anticipated growth in aluminum demand and to meet obligations outlined in power agreements with energy providers 
in late  management approved the permanent shutdown and demolition of the smelter located in tennessee and two potlines capacity of kmt per year at the smelter located in rockdale four potlines remain 
this decision was made after a comprehensive strategic analysis was performed to determine the best course of action for each facility 
factors leading to this decision were in general focused on achieving sustained competitiveness and included  among others lack of an economically viable  long term power solution  changed market fundamentals  cost competitiveness  required future capital investment  and restart costs 
also  at the end of  management approved a partial or full curtailment of three european smelters as follows portovesme  italy kmt per year  avil s  spain kmt out of kmt per year  and la coru a  spain kmt out of kmt per year 
these curtailments are expected to be completed in the first half of the curtailment of the portovesme smelter may lead to the permanent closure of the facility  while the curtailments at the two smelters in spain are planned to be temporary 
these actions are the result of uncompetitive energy positions  combined with rising material costs and falling aluminum prices mid to late 
sales sales for were  compared with sales of  in  an improvement of  or 
the increase was primarily due to a rise in realized prices for alumina and aluminum  better pricing in the midstream segment  and higher volumes in the primary metals segment and virtually all businesses in the midstream and downstream segments 
sales for were  compared with sales of  in  an improvement of  or 
the increase was mainly driven by a rise in realized prices for alumina and aluminum  as a result of significantly higher lme prices  favorable pricing in the midstream segment  and sales from the smelters in norway acquired on march  increase of  slightly offset by the absence of sales from divested businesses transportation products europe and most of global foil decrease of and unfavorable mix in the downstream segment 
cost of goods sold cogs as a percentage of sales was in compared with in the percentage was negatively impacted by higher energy and raw materials costs and net unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker us dollar  mostly offset by the previously mentioned higher realized prices and net productivity improvements 

table of contents cogs as a percentage of sales was in compared with in the percentage was positively impacted by the significant rise in realized prices for alumina and aluminum  net cost savings and productivity improvements across all segments  and the absence of a charge related to a european commission s decision on electricity pricing for smelters in italy  somewhat offset by net unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker us dollar  unfavorable lifo adjustments  as a result of the considerable rise in lme prices  and a significantly smaller reduction in lifo inventory quantities  increases in energy costs  and higher operating costs for brazil growth projects placed in service 
selling  general administrative  and other expenses sg a expenses were  or of sales  in compared with  or of sales  in the increase of was principally the result of higher labor costs and an increase in bad debt expense 
the increase in labor costs was the result of a higher average employee base and a higher cost of employee benefits 
the higher bad debt expense was caused by charges for anticipated customer credit losses  primarily related to those in europe 
sg a expenses were  or of sales  in compared with  or of sales  in the decline of was mostly due to reductions in expenses for contractors and consultants  lower deferred compensation  as a result of a decline in plan performance  and decreases in bad debt expense and information technology expenditures 
an increase in labor costs  principally due to higher annual incentive and performance compensation and employee benefits costs employer matching savings plan contributions for us salaried participants were suspended during somewhat offset the aforementioned expense reductions 
research and development expenses r d expenses were in compared with in and in the increase in as compared to and in as compared to was mainly driven by incremental increases across varying expenses necessary to support r d activities 
provision for depreciation  depletion  and amortization the provision for dd a was  in compared with  in the increase of  or  was mostly due to a portion of the assets placed into service in mid related to a new hydroelectric power facility in brazil  along with a number of small increases at various locations 
the provision for dd a was  in compared with  in the increase of  or  was principally the result of the assets placed into service during the second half of related to the juruti bauxite mine development and s o lu s refinery expansion in brazil  the smelters in norway acquired on march   the new bohai china flat rolled product facility  and a high quality coated sheet line at the samara russia facility  slightly offset by the cessation in dd a due to the decision in early to permanently shut down and demolish two us smelters see restructuring and other charges below 
restructuring and other charges restructuring and other charges for each year in the three year period ended december  were comprised of the following asset impairments layoff costs other exit costs reversals of previously recorded layoff and other exit costs restructuring and other charges layoff costs were recorded based on approved detailed action plans submitted by the operating locations that specified positions to be eliminated  benefits to be paid under existing severance plans  union contracts or statutory requirements  and the expected timetable for completion of the plans

croix location  a net charge of after tax for other small items  and after tax for the reversal of previously recorded layoff reserves due to normal attrition and changes in facts and circumstances  including a change in plans for alcoa s aluminum powder facility in rockdale  tx 
in late  management approved the permanent shutdown and demolition of certain facilities at two us locations  each of which was previously temporarily idled for various reasons 
the identified facilities are the smelter located in alcoa  tn capacity of kmt per year and two potlines capacity of kmt per year at the smelter located in rockdale  tx remaining capacity of kmt per year composed of four potlines 
demolition and remediation activities related to these actions will begin in the first half of and are expected to be completed in for the tennessee smelter and in for the two potlines at the rockdale smelter 
this decision was made after a comprehensive strategic analysis was performed to determine the best course of action for each facility

the other exit costs of represent after tax in environmental remediation and after tax in asset retirement obligations  both triggered by the decision to permanently shut down and demolish these structures  and after tax in other related costs 
also  at the end of  management approved a partial or full curtailment of three european smelters as follows portovesme  italy kmt per year  avil s  spain kmt out of kmt per year  and la coru a  spain kmt out of kmt per year 
these curtailments are expected to be completed in the first half of the curtailment of the portovesme smelter may lead to the permanent closure of the facility  while the curtailments at the two smelters in spain are planned to be temporary 
these actions are the result of uncompetitive energy positions  combined with rising material costs and falling aluminum prices mid to late 
as a result of these decisions  alcoa recorded costs of after tax for the layoff of approximately employees 
as alcoa engages in discussions with the respective employee representatives and governments  additional charges may be recognized in as of december   approximately of the  employees were terminated

the effective tax rate differs from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to foreign income taxed in lower rate jurisdictions  a discrete income tax benefit for the reversal of a valuation allowance as a result of previously restricted net operating losses of a foreign subsidiary now available  a discrete income tax benefit related to a canadian provincial tax law change permitting a tax return to be filed in us dollars  and a net discrete income tax benefit for various other items  partially offset by a discrete income tax charge as a result of a change in the tax 
table of contents treatment of federal subsidies received related to prescription drug benefits provided under certain retiree health care benefit plans that were determined to be actuarially equivalent to medicare part d and a discrete income tax charge based on settlement discussions of several matters with international taxing authorities this amount represents a decrease to alcoa s unrecognized tax benefits 
alcoa s effective tax rate was benefit on a loss in compared with the us federal statutory rate of 
the effective tax rate differs from the us federal statutory rate principally due to a income tax benefit related to the noncontrolling interests share of the gain associated with the acquisition of a bhp billiton subsidiary in the republic of suriname and the following discrete tax items a benefit for the reorganization of an equity investment  a benefit for the reversal of a valuation allowance on foreign deferred tax assets  a benefit for a tax rate change from to in iceland  a benefit related to a canadian tax law change allowing a tax return to be filed in us dollars  a benefit related to a change in the sale structure of two locations included in the global foil business than originally anticipated  and a benefit related to the elkem sapa ab exchange transaction 
partially offsetting these benefits were items related to smelter operations in italy  which included a valuation allowance placed on existing deferred tax assets and charges not tax benefitted as follows related to a recent decision by the european commission on electricity pricing  for environmental remediation  and for layoffs 
management anticipates that the effective tax rate in will be approximately 
however  changes in the current economic environment  tax legislation or rate changes  currency fluctuations  ability to realize deferred tax assets  and the results of operations in certain taxing jurisdictions may cause this estimated rate to fluctuate 
in december  one of the company s subsidiaries in brazil applied for a tax holiday related to its expanded mining and refining operations 
if approved  the tax rate for this subsidiary will decrease significantly  resulting in future cash tax savings over the year holiday period would be effective as of january  
additionally  the net deferred tax asset of the subsidiary would be remeasured at the lower rate in the period the holiday is approved 
this remeasurement would result in a decrease to the net deferred tax asset and a noncash charge to earnings of approximately to noncontrolling interests net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was in compared with in the increase of was largely the result of higher earnings at alcoa world alumina and chemicals awac  which is owned by alcoa and by alumina limited 
the improved earnings at awac were mainly driven by higher realized prices  partially offset by higher input costs and net unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker us dollar 
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was in compared with in the increase of was mostly due to higher earnings at awac  which is owned by alcoa and by alumina limited

loss from discontinued operations loss from discontinued operations in was comprised of an additional loss of pretax related to the wire harness and electrical portion of the electrical and electronic solutions ees business as a result of a negotiated preliminary settlement related to claims filed in against alcoa by platinum equity in an insolvency proceeding in germany  a net gain of pretax related to both the wire harness and electrical portion and the electronics portion of the ees business for a number of small post closing and other adjustments  and a pretax reversal of the gain recognized in related to the sale of the home exteriors business for an adjustment to an outstanding obligation  which was part of the terms of sale 
loss from discontinued operations in was comprised of an additional loss of pretax related to the wire harness and electrical portion of the ees business as a result of a contract settlement with a former customer of this business and an additional loss of pretax related to the electronics portion of the ees business for the settling of working capital  which was not included in the divestiture transaction 

table of contents loss from discontinued operations in was comprised of a pretax loss on the divestiture of the wire harness and electrical portion of the ees business  a pretax loss on the divestiture of the electronics portion of the ees business  and the remainder was for the operational results of the ees business prior to the divestitures 
in late  alcoa reclassified the ees business to discontinued operations based on the decision to divest the business 
the divestiture of the wire harness and electrical portion of the ees business was completed in june and the divestiture of the electronics portion of the ees business was completed in december the results of the engineered products and solutions segment were reclassified to reflect the movement of the ees business into discontinued operations 
segment information alcoa s operations consist of four worldwide reportable segments alumina  primary metals  flat rolled products  and engineered products and solutions 
segment performance under alcoa s management reporting system is evaluated based on a number of factors  however  the primary measure of performance is the after tax operating income atoi of each segment 
certain items such as the impact of lifo inventory accounting  interest expense  noncontrolling interests  corporate expense general administrative and selling expenses of operating the corporate headquarters and other global administrative facilities  along with depreciation and amortization on corporate owned assets  restructuring and other charges  discontinued operations  and other items  including intersegment profit eliminations and other metal adjustments  differences between tax rates applicable to the segments and the consolidated effective tax rate  the results of the soft alloy extrusions business in brazil  and other nonoperating items such as foreign currency transaction gains losses and interest income are excluded from segment atoi 
atoi for all reportable segments totaled  in   in  and in see note q to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item of this form k for additional information 
the following discussion provides shipments  sales  and atoi data for each reportable segment and production data for the alumina and primary metals segments for each of the three years in the period ended december  alumina alumina production kmt third party alumina shipments kmt third party sales intersegment sales total sales atoi this segment represents a portion of alcoa s upstream operations and consists of the company s worldwide refinery system  including the mining of bauxite  which is then refined into alumina 
alumina is mainly sold directly to internal and external smelter customers worldwide or is sold to customers who process it into industrial chemical products 
a portion of this segment s third party sales are completed through the use of agents  alumina traders  and distributors 
slightly more than half of alcoa s alumina production is sold under supply contracts to third parties worldwide  while the remainder is used internally by the primary metals segment 
in  alumina production increased by kmt compared to the improvement was mostly the result of higher production at the s o lu s brazil refinery  as the ramp up of the  kmt expanded capacity the alumina segment s share is approximately  kmt per year that began in late continued through 
table of contents in  alumina production increased by  kmt compared to the increase was mainly driven by the point comfort  tx refinery as most of the  kmt per year curtailment initiated between the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of was restored 
in addition  production included the continued ramp up of the s o lu s refinery expansion and the interest in the suralco suriname refinery acquired in mid third party sales for the alumina segment improved in compared with  largely attributable to a increase in realized prices  driven by the movement of customer contracts to alumina index pricing  benefits from improved spot prices  and improved pricing from lme based contracts 
third party sales for this segment rose in compared with  primarily related to a increase in realized prices  driven by significantly higher lme prices  coupled with a increase in volumes 
intersegment sales for the alumina segment climbed in compared with and in compared with the increase in both period comparisons was principally due to higher realized prices and an increase in demand from the primary metals segment 
atoi for the alumina segment increased in compared with  mainly caused by the significant improvement in realized prices and a gain on the sale of land in australia  partially offset by considerably higher input costs  particularly related to caustic and fuel oil  and net unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker us dollar  especially against the australian dollar 
atoi for this segment improved in compared with  mostly due to the significant increase in realized prices and benefits of cost savings initiatives  particularly lower caustic costs 
these positive impacts were partially offset by net unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker us dollar  particularly against the australian dollar  higher depreciation expense and operating costs includes the impact of a failure of a ship unloader associated with the start up of the juruti bauxite mine and the s o lu s refinery expansion  both of which began in the second half of  the absence of a gain recognized on the acquisition of bhp billiton s interest in suralco  and higher fuel oil costs 
in  third party sales will continue to shift towards alumina index or spot pricing  and productivity improvements will be an intense area of focus 
also  significant  planned maintenance for operations in australia during the first part of the year and higher costs for raw materials are expected to negatively impact results 
additionally  alumina production across the global system will be reduced to reflect smelter curtailments as well as prevailing market conditions 
furthermore  in the second half of  alcoa s refineries in australia will be subject to a carbon tax recently approved by the australian government related to greenhouse gas emissions  this is not expected to have a significant impact on the alumina segment s results in primary metals aluminum production kmt third party aluminum shipments kmt alcoa s average realized price per metric ton of aluminum third party sales intersegment sales total sales atoi this segment represents a portion of alcoa s upstream operations and consists of the company s worldwide smelter system 
primary metals receives alumina  mostly from the alumina segment  and produces primary aluminum used by alcoa s fabricating businesses  as well as sold to external customers  aluminum traders  and commodity markets 
results from the sale of aluminum powder  scrap  and excess power are also included in this segment  as well as the results of aluminum derivative contracts and buy resell activity 
primary aluminum produced by alcoa and used internally is transferred to other segments at prevailing market prices 
the sale of primary aluminum represents more 
table of contents than of this segment s third party sales 
buy resell activity refers to when this segment purchases metal from external or internal sources and resells such metal to external customers or the midstream and downstream segments in order to maximize smelting system efficiency and to meet customer requirements 
at december   alcoa had kmt of idle capacity on a base capacity of  kmt 
in  idle capacity decreased kmt compared to due to the full restart of previously curtailed production capacity in the us massena east  ny kmt per year  wenatchee  wa kmt per year  and ferndale  wa intalco kmt per year kmt more than previously planned 
these restarts increased aluminum production by approximately kmt during and are expected to increase aluminum production by kmt on an annual basis in and beyond and occurred to help meet anticipated growth in aluminum demand and to meet obligations outlined in power agreements with energy providers 
in late  management approved the permanent shutdown and demolition of certain facilities at two us locations  each of which was previously temporarily idled for various reasons 
the identified facilities are the smelter located in alcoa  tn capacity of kmt per year and two potlines capacity of kmt per year at the smelter located in rockdale  tx remaining capacity of kmt per year composed of four potlines 
this decision was made after a comprehensive strategic analysis was performed to determine the best course of action for each facility 
factors leading to this decision were in general focused on achieving sustained competitiveness and included  among others lack of an economically viable  long term power solution  changed market fundamentals  cost competitiveness  required future capital investment  and restart costs 
also  at the end of  management approved a partial or full curtailment of three european smelters as follows portovesme  italy kmt per year  avil s  spain kmt out of kmt per year  and la coru a  spain kmt out of kmt per year 
these curtailments are expected to be completed in the first half of the curtailment of the portovesme smelter may lead to the permanent closure of the facility  while the curtailments at the two smelters in spain are planned to be temporary 
these actions are the result of uncompetitive energy positions  combined with rising material costs and falling aluminum prices mid to late 
as a result of these decisions  idle capacity is expected to decrease by a net kmt and base capacity will decline by kmt during at december   alcoa had kmt of idle capacity on a base capacity of  kmt 
in  idle capacity decreased kmt compared to due to the restart of kmt of previously curtailed production capacity at a smelter in brazil  the decision to permanently curtail the smelters located in frederick  md kmt per year and badin  nc kmt per year and one potline kmt per year at the smelter in warrick  in  and the restart of kmt of previously curtailed production capacity at various smelters  slightly offset by the full curtailment of the fusina smelter kmt per year in italy as a result of uneconomical power prices 
in june  alcoa halted production at the avil s smelter kmt per year in spain due to torrential flooding 
production was restarted a few months after the flood and the smelter was at full operating rate by the end of base capacity dropped kmt between december  and due to the previously mentioned permanent curtailments 
the decision to permanently curtail these facilities was made after a comprehensive strategic analysis was performed to determine the best course of action for each facility 
factors leading to this decision included current market fundamentals  cost competitiveness  other existing idle capacity  required future capital investment  and restart costs  as well as the elimination of ongoing holding costs 
in  aluminum production improved by kmt  mainly the result of the previously mentioned restarted capacity at massena east  ferndale  and wenatchee  as well as higher production at the avil s smelter see above 
in  aluminum production increased by kmt  mostly due to the two smelters located in norway acquired full ownership on march   previously held a equity interest  as well as a number of small increases at other smelters  but was virtually offset by the smelter curtailments during for tennessee and massena east and during for fusina and the halted production at the avil s smelter

atoi for the primary metals segment declined in compared with  primarily caused by significantly higher input costs  including carbon  alumina  and energy  and net unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker us dollar  virtually offset by improved realized prices  net productivity improvements  and higher excess power sales 
atoi for this segment improved  in compared with  principally related to the significant increase in realized prices  the absence of a charge related to a european commission s decision on electricity pricing for smelters in italy  and benefits from cost savings initiatives  particularly coke and pitch  somewhat offset by much higher alumina and energy prices  the absence of a gain related to alcoa s acquisition of the other of the smelters in norway  and net unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker us dollar 
in  pricing is anticipated to follow a day lag on the lme and net productivity improvements are expected to continue 
also  planned maintenance for power plants during the first part of the year and higher energy costs are expected to negatively impact results  while a benefit is anticipated in the second half of the year related to coke prices as a result of a shift in the supply demand balance from short to long 
additionally  three smelters in europe  representing kmt per year  are expected to be fully or partially curtailed during the first half of the year

a number of changes were also made to alcoa s capital expenditures strategy as follows capital expenditure approval levels were lowered dramatically  growth projects were halted where it was deemed economically feasible  and all non critical capital expenditures were stopped 
capital expenditures are deemed critical if they maintain alcoa s compliance with the law  keep a facility operating  or satisfy customer requirements if the benefits outweigh the costs 
the planned sale or shutdown of various businesses contributed positively to alcoa s liquidity position in in march  management initiated an additional series of operational and financial actions to significantly improve alcoa s cost structure and liquidity 
operational actions included procurement efficiencies and overhead rationalization to reduce costs and working capital initiatives to yield significant cash improvements 
financial actions included a reduction in the quarterly common stock dividend from per share to per share  which began with the dividend paid on may   and the issuance of million shares of common stock and in convertible notes that collectively yielded  in net proceeds 
in january  management initiated further operational actions to not only maintain the procurement and overhead savings and working capital improvements achieved in  but to improve on them throughout also  a further reduction in capital expenditures was planned in order to achieve the level necessary to sustain operations without sacrificing the quality of alcoa s alumina and aluminum products 
in  management continued its previous actions to maintain the achieved procurement and overhead savings from the past two years and to further improve cash with working capital initiatives 
additionally  maintaining a level of capital expenditures consistent with that of was planned 
during  management plans to continue the actions from the past three years to achieve additional procurement and overhead savings  to further improve on working capital  and to maintain a consistent level of capital expenditures

this program was renewed on october  and was due to expire on october  on march   alcoa terminated this program and repaid the originally received in in light of the adoption of accounting changes related to the transfer of financial assets  had the securitization program not been terminated  it would have resulted in a increase in both receivables from customers and short term borrowings on alcoa s consolidated balance sheet 
also on march   alcoa entered into two one year arrangements both were renewed in march with third parties to sell certain customer receivables outright without recourse on a continuous basis 
additionally  in november  alcoa entered into a five year arrangement with another third party to sell additional customer receivables outright without recourse on a continuous basis 
as of december   of the sold receivables under the three arrangements combined were uncollected 
alcoa is servicing the customer receivables for the third parties at market rates  therefore  no servicing asset or liability was recorded 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make certain judgments  estimates  and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and disclosed in the accompanying notes 
areas that require significant judgments  estimates  and assumptions include accounting for derivatives and hedging activities  environmental and litigation matters  asset retirement obligations  the testing of goodwill  equity investments  and properties  plants  and equipment for impairment  estimating fair value of businesses to be divested  pension plans and other postretirement benefits obligations  stock based compensation  and income taxes 
management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments  estimates  and assumptions  and actual results may differ from those used to prepare the company s consolidated financial statements at any given time 
despite these inherent limitations  management believes that management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the company 
a summary of the company s significant accounting policies is included in note a to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item of this form k 
management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the consolidated financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company s operating results and financial condition 

table of contents derivatives and hedging 
derivatives are held for purposes other than trading and are part of a formally documented risk management program 
for derivatives designated as fair value hedges  alcoa measures hedge effectiveness by formally assessing  at least quarterly  the historical high correlation of changes in the fair value of the hedged item and the derivative hedging instrument 
for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  alcoa measures hedge effectiveness by formally assessing  at least quarterly  the probable high correlation of the expected future cash flows of the hedged item and the derivative hedging instrument 
the ineffective portions of both types of hedges are recorded in sales or other income or expense in the current period 
if the hedging relationship ceases to be highly effective or it becomes probable that an expected transaction will no longer occur  future gains or losses on the derivative instrument are recorded in other income or expense 
alcoa accounts for interest rate swaps related to its existing long term debt and hedges of firm customer commitments for aluminum as fair value hedges 
as a result  the fair values of the derivatives and changes in the fair values of the underlying hedged items are reported in other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
changes in the fair values of these derivatives and underlying hedged items generally offset and are recorded each period in sales or interest expense  consistent with the underlying hedged item 
alcoa accounts for hedges of foreign currency exposures and certain forecasted transactions as cash flow hedges 
the fair values of the derivatives are recorded in other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
the effective portions of the changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recorded in other comprehensive income and are reclassified to sales  cost of goods sold  or other income or expense in the period in which earnings are impacted by the hedged items or in the period that the transaction no longer qualifies as a cash flow hedge 
these contracts cover the same periods as known or expected exposures  generally not exceeding five years 
if no hedging relationship is designated  the derivative is marked to market through earnings 
cash flows from derivatives are recognized in the statement of consolidated cash flows in a manner consistent with the underlying transactions 
environmental matters 
expenditures for current operations are expensed or capitalized  as appropriate 
expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations  which will not contribute to future revenues  are expensed 
liabilities are recorded when remediation costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
the liability may include costs such as site investigations  consultant fees  feasibility studies  outside contractors  and monitoring expenses 
estimates are generally not discounted or reduced by potential claims for recovery 
claims for recovery are recognized as agreements are reached with third parties 
the estimates also include costs related to other potentially responsible parties to the extent that alcoa has reason to believe such parties will not fully pay their proportionate share 
the liability is continuously reviewed and adjusted to reflect current remediation progress  prospective estimates of required activity  and other factors that may be relevant  including changes in technology or regulations 
litigation matters 
for asserted claims and assessments  liabilities are recorded when an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be probable and the loss is reasonably estimable 
management determines the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome based on many factors such as the nature of the matter  available defenses and case strategy  progress of the matter  views and opinions of legal counsel and other advisors  applicability and success of appeals processes  and the outcome of similar historical matters  among others 
once an unfavorable outcome is deemed probable  management weighs the probability of estimated losses  and the most reasonable loss estimate is recorded 
if an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be reasonably possible  then the matter is disclosed and no liability is recorded 
with respect to unasserted claims or assessments  management must first determine that the probability that an assertion will be made is likely  then  a determination as to the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to reasonably estimate the potential loss is made 
legal matters are reviewed on a continuous basis to determine if there has been a change in management s judgment regarding the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or the estimate of a potential loss 
asset retirement obligations 
alcoa recognizes asset retirement obligations aros related to legal obligations associated with the normal operation of alcoa s bauxite mining  alumina refining  and aluminum smelting facilities 
these aros consist primarily of costs associated with spent pot lining disposal  closure of bauxite residue areas  mine 
table of contents reclamation  and landfill closure 
alcoa also recognizes aros for any significant lease restoration obligation  if required by a lease agreement  and for the disposal of regulated waste materials related to the demolition of certain power facilities 
the fair values of these aros are recorded on a discounted basis  at the time the obligation is incurred  and accreted over time for the change in present value 
additionally  alcoa capitalizes asset retirement costs by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived assets and depreciating these assets over their remaining useful life 
certain conditional asset retirement obligations caros related to alumina refineries  aluminum smelters  and fabrication facilities have not been recorded in the consolidated financial statements due to uncertainties surrounding the ultimate settlement date 
a caro is a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within alcoa s control 
such uncertainties exist as a result of the perpetual nature of the structures  maintenance and upgrade programs  and other factors 
at the date a reasonable estimate of the ultimate settlement date can be made  alcoa would record an aro for the removal  treatment  transportation  storage and or disposal of various regulated assets and hazardous materials such as asbestos  underground and aboveground storage tanks  polychlorinated biphenyls  various process residuals  solid wastes  electronic equipment waste  and various other materials 
such amounts may be material to the consolidated financial statements in the period in which they are recorded 
if alcoa was required to demolish all such structures immediately  the estimated caro as of december  ranges from less than to per structure structures in today s dollars 
goodwill 
goodwill is not amortized  instead  it is reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell a business 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred 
such indicators may include deterioration in general economic conditions  negative developments in equity and credit markets  adverse changes in the markets in which an entity operates  increases in input costs that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows  or a trend of negative or declining cash flows over multiple periods  among others 
the fair value that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from that used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill 
goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level  which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment 
alcoa has nine reporting units  of which five are included in the engineered products and solutions segment 
the remaining four reporting units are the alumina segment  the primary metals segment  the flat rolled products segment  and the soft alloy extrusions business in brazil  which is included in corporate 
almost of alcoa s total goodwill is allocated to three reporting units as follows alcoa fastening systems afs  and alcoa power and propulsion app  businesses  both of which are included in the engineered products and solutions segment  and primary metals 
these amounts include an allocation of corporate s goodwill 
in september  the financial accounting standards board issued new accounting guidance for testing goodwill for impairment see the recently adopted accounting guidance section of note a to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item of this form k 
the guidance provides an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not more than that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if an entity elects to perform a qualitative assessment and determines that an impairment is more likely than not  the entity is then required to perform the existing two step quantitative impairment test described below  otherwise no further analysis is required 
an entity also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and  instead  proceed directly to the two step quantitative impairment test 
the ultimate outcome of the goodwill impairment review for a reporting unit should be the same whether an entity chooses to perform the qualitative assessment or proceeds directly to the two step quantitative impairment test 
in the fourth quarter  in conjunction with management s annual review of goodwill  alcoa early adopted the new guidance 
as a result  alcoa instituted a policy for its annual review of goodwill to perform the qualitative assessment for all reporting units not subjected directly to the two step quantitative impairment test 
management will proceed 
table of contents directly to the two step quantitative impairment test for a minimum of three reporting units based on facts and circumstances during each annual review of goodwill 
this policy will result in each of the nine reporting units being subjected to the two step quantitative impairment test at least once during every three year period 
under the qualitative assessment  various events and circumstances or factors that would affect the estimated fair value of a reporting unit are identified similar to impairment indicators above 
these factors are then classified by the type of impact they would have on the estimated fair value using positive  neutral  and adverse categories based on current business conditions 
additionally  an assessment of the level of impact that a particular factor would have on the estimated fair value is determined using high  medium  and low weighting 
furthermore  management considers the results of the most recent two step quantitative impairment test completed for a reporting unit this would be in which the estimated fair values of all nine reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying values and compares the weighted average cost of capital wacc between the current and prior years for each reporting unit 
during the annual review of goodwill  management performed the qualitative assessment for six reporting units 
management concluded that it was not more likely than not that the estimated fair values of the six reporting units were less than their carrying values 
as such  no further analysis was required 
under the two step quantitative impairment test  the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
alcoa uses a dcf model to estimate the current fair value of its reporting units when testing for impairment  as management believes forecasted cash flows are the best indicator of such fair value 
a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the dcf model to forecast operating cash flows  including markets and market share  sales volumes and prices  costs to produce  tax rates  capital spending  discount rate  and working capital changes 
most of these assumptions vary significantly among the reporting units 
cash flow forecasts are generally based on approved business unit operating plans for the early years and historical relationships in later years 
the betas used in calculating the individual reporting units wacc rate are estimated for each business with the assistance of valuation experts 
in the event the estimated fair value of a reporting unit per the dcf model is less than the carrying value  additional analysis would be required 
the additional analysis would compare the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill with the implied fair value of that goodwill  which may involve the use of valuation experts 
the implied fair value of goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value amounts assigned to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit was acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit represented the purchase price 
if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss equal to such excess would be recognized  which could significantly and adversely impact reported results of operations and shareholders equity 
during the annual review of goodwill  management proceeded directly to the two step quantitative impairment test for three reporting units as follows the primary metals segment  building and construction systems  which is included in the engineered products and solutions segment  and the soft alloy extrusions business in brazil 
the estimated fair values of these three reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying values  resulting in no impairment 
as part of the annual review of goodwill  management considered the market capitalization of alcoa s common stock in relation to the company s total shareholders equity 
at december   the market capitalization of alcoa s common stock was  while this amount is less than the company s total shareholders equity at december   the estimated aggregate fair value of alcoa s reporting units was substantially in excess of the aforementioned market capitalization amount 
in management s judgment  the main reasons for the difference between alcoa s market capitalization and total shareholders equity at december  are the overall decline in the capital markets and significantly lower commodity prices 
as it relates to the capital markets  there was  and continues to be  significant uncertainty of the sovereign debt of many european countries 
this uncertainty has affected the liquidity of many companies that either operate or are located in europe  although  alcoa has not been impacted significantly 
the combination of this uncertainty and the continuing decline in commodity prices caused significant and volatile fluctuations in the price of alcoa s common stock 
at december  and  the market price of alcoa s common stock was and  respectively  which equates to a decline of 
during  the size and 
table of contents structure of the company did not change and there were no specific events or transactions that would cause management to reasonably expect such a decline in the market price of alcoa s common stock 
as a result  management believes the quoted market price of alcoa s common stock does not fully reflect the underlying value of the future aggregate cash flows of the company s reporting units 
accordingly  management does not believe that the comparison of alcoa s market capitalization and total shareholders equity as of december  is an indication that goodwill is impaired 
equity investments 
alcoa invests in a number of privately held companies  primarily through joint ventures and consortia  which are accounted for on the equity method 
the equity method is applied in situations where alcoa has the ability to exercise significant influence  but not control  over the investee 
management reviews equity investments for impairment whenever certain indicators are present suggesting that the carrying value of an investment is not recoverable 
this analysis requires a significant amount of judgment from management to identify events or circumstances indicating that an equity investment is impaired 
the following items are examples of impairment indicators significant  sustained declines in an investee s revenue  earnings  and cash flow trends  adverse market conditions of the investee s industry or geographic area  the investee s ability to continue operations measured by several items  including liquidity  and other factors 
once an impairment indicator is identified  management uses considerable judgment to determine if the impairment is other than temporary  in which case the equity investment is written down to its estimated fair value 
an impairment that is other than temporary could significantly and adversely impact reported results of operations 
properties  plants  and equipment 
properties  plants  and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets asset group may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets is determined by comparing the estimated undiscounted net cash flows of the operations related to the assets asset group to their carrying amount 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the assets asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted net cash flows 
the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded is calculated as the excess of the carrying value of the assets asset group over their fair value  with fair value determined using the best information available  which generally is a dcf model 
the determination of what constitutes an asset group  the associated estimated undiscounted net cash flows  and the estimated useful lives of assets also require significant judgments 
discontinued operations and assets held for sale 
the fair values of all businesses to be divested are estimated using accepted valuation techniques such as a dcf model  valuations performed by third parties  earnings multiples  or indicative bids  when available 
a number of significant estimates and assumptions are involved in the application of these techniques  including the forecasting of markets and market share  sales volumes and prices  costs and expenses  and multiple other factors 
management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the estimates are made  however  the fair value that is ultimately realized upon the divestiture of a business may differ from the estimated fair value reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
pension and other postretirement benefits 
liabilities and expenses for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined using actuarial methodologies and incorporate significant assumptions  including the interest rate used to discount the future estimated liability  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce salary increases  health care cost trend rates  retirement age  and mortality 
the interest rate used to discount future estimated liabilities is determined using a company specific yield curve model above median developed with the assistance of an external actuary 
the cash flows of the plans projected benefit obligations are discounted using a single equivalent rate derived from yields on high quality corporate bonds  which represent a broad diversification of issuers in various sectors  including finance and banking  manufacturing  transportation  insurance  and pharmaceutical  among others 
the yield curve model parallels the plans projected cash flows  which have an average duration of years  and the underlying cash flows of the bonds included in the model exceed the cash flows needed to satisfy the company s plans obligations multiple times 
in   and  the discount rate used to determine benefit obligations for us pension and other postretirement benefit plans was   and  respectively 
the impact on the liabilities of a change in the discount rate of of would be approximately and either a charge or credit of to after tax earnings in the following year 

table of contents the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is generally applied to a five year market related value of plan assets a four year average or the fair value at the plan measurement date is used for certain non us plans 
the process used by management to develop this assumption has expanded from one that relied primarily on historical asset return information to one that also incorporates forward looking returns by asset class  as described below 
prior to developing the expected long term rate of return for calendar year  management focused on historical actual returns annual  year moving  and year moving averages when developing this assumption 
based on that process  management utilized for the expected long term rate of return for several years through for calendar year  the expected long term rate of return was reduced to due to lower future expected market returns as a result of the then global economic downturn 
this was supported by the fact that  in  the year moving average of actual performance fell below for the first time in years  although the year moving average continued to exceed 
for calendar year  management expanded its process by incorporating expected future returns on current and planned asset allocations using information from various external investment managers and management s own judgment 
management considered this forward looking analysis as well as the historical return information  and concluded the expected rate of return for calendar would remain at  which was between the year moving average actual return performance and the estimated future return developed by asset class 
for calendar year  management again incorporated both actual historical return information and expected future returns into its analysis 
based on strategic asset allocation changes and estimates of future returns by asset class  management used as its expected long term rate of return for this rate again falls within the range of the year moving average of actual performance and the expected future return developed by asset class 
for calendar year  management used the same methodology as it did for and determined that will be the expected long term rate of return 
a change in the assumption for the expected long term rate of return on plan assets of of would impact after tax earnings by approximately for in  a net charge of after tax was recorded in other comprehensive loss  primarily due to an basis point decrease in the discount rate  which was slightly offset by the favorable performance of the plan assets and the recognition of actuarial losses and prior service costs 
in  a net charge of after tax was recorded in other comprehensive income  primarily due to a basis point decrease in the discount rate  which was somewhat offset by the favorable performance of the plan assets and the recognition of actuarial losses and prior service costs 
in  a net charge of after tax was recorded in other comprehensive income  primarily due to a basis point decrease in the discount rate  which was somewhat offset by the favorable performance of the plan assets and the recognition of actuarial losses and prior service costs 
additionally  in and  a charge of and  respectively  was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss due to the reclassification of deferred taxes related to the medicare part d prescription drug subsidy 
stock based compensation 
alcoa recognizes compensation expense for employee equity grants using the non substantive vesting period approach  in which the expense net of estimated forfeitures is recognized ratably over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value 
the fair value of new stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a lattice pricing model 
determining the fair value of stock options at the grant date requires judgment  including estimates for the average risk free interest rate  dividend yield  volatility  annual forfeiture rate  and exercise behavior 
these assumptions may differ significantly between grant dates because of changes in the actual results of these inputs that occur over time 
as part of alcoa s stock based compensation plan design  individuals who are retirement eligible have a six month requisite service period in the year of grant 
equity grants are issued in january each year 
as a result  a larger portion of expense will be recognized in the first half of each year for these retirement eligible employees 
compensation 
table of contents expense recorded in   and was after tax  after tax  and after tax  respectively 
of this amount    and in   and  respectively  pertains to the acceleration of expense related to retirement eligible employees 
most plan participants can choose whether to receive their award in the form of stock options  stock awards  or a combination of both 
this choice is made before the grant is issued and is irrevocable 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes 
under this approach  the provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable or received or receivable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year 
deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid  and result from differences between the financial and tax bases of alcoa s assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when enacted 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 
in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance  management considers all potential sources of taxable income  including income available in carryback periods  future reversals of taxable temporary differences  projections of taxable income  and income from tax planning strategies  as well as all available positive and negative evidence 
positive evidence includes factors such as a history of profitable operations  projections of future profitability within the carryforward period  including from tax planning strategies  and the company s experience with similar operations 
existing favorable contracts and the ability to sell products into established markets are additional positive evidence 
negative evidence includes items such as cumulative losses  projections of future losses  or carryforward periods that are not long enough to allow for the utilization of a deferred tax asset based on existing projections of income 
deferred tax assets for which no valuation allowance is recorded may not be realized upon changes in facts and circumstances  resulting in a future charge to establish a valuation allowance 
tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more likely than not threshold 
otherwise  these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled  which means that the statute of limitation has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed their examination even though the statute of limitations remains open 
interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized as part of the provision for income taxes and are accrued beginning in the period that such interest and penalties would be applicable under relevant tax law until such time that the related tax benefits are recognized 
related party transactions alcoa buys products from and sells products to various related companies  consisting of entities in which alcoa retains a or less equity interest  at negotiated arms length prices between the two parties 
these transactions were not material to the financial position or results of operations of alcoa for all periods presented
