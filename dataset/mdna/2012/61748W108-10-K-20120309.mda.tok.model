item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected historical financial and operating data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in addition to historical information  this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including but not limited to  those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a fully integrated lifestyle hospitality company that operates  owns  acquires  develops and redevelops boutique hotels  primarily in gateway cities and select resort markets in the united states  europe and other international locations  and nightclubs  restaurants  bars and other food and beverage venues in many of the hotels we operate  as well as in hotels and casinos operated by mgm in las vegas 
over our year history  we have gained experience operating in a variety of market conditions 
the historical financial data presented herein is the historical financial data for our three owned hotels  consisting  as of december   of hudson in new york  delano south beach in miami beach  and clift in san francisco which we lease under a long term lease that is treated as a financing  comprising approximately  rooms  our owned f b operations  consisting  as of december   of certain food and beverage operations located at morgans and hudson in new york  delano south beach in miami beach  clift in san francisco  and sanderson and st martins lane  both in london 
effective february   we transferred our ownership interest in morgans f b operations to the hotel owner by terminating our operating lease for the restaurant space  our four joint venture hotels  consisting  as of december   of mondrian south beach in miami beach  shore club in miami beach  ames in boston and mondrian soho in new york  comprising approximately  rooms  our six managed hotels  consisting  as of december   of royalton and morgans in new york  mondrian in los angeles  sanderson and st martins lane in london  and hotel las palapas in playa del carmen  mexico  comprising approximately rooms  our controlling interest in tlg  a leading lifestyle food and beverage management company with a ten year track record of delivering cutting edge food and beverage experiences at world class properties 
tlg develops  redevelops and operates numerous venues in las vegas pursuant to management agreements with mgm  including nightclubs  such as the bank nightclub at bellagio hotel and casino and haze at aria resort and casino at citycenter  restaurants  such as yellowtail japanese restaurant lounge at bellagio hotel and casino and diablos mexican cantina at monte carlo hotel  pool lounges and bars 
tlg also serves as our food and beverage platform  operating or assisting in the development  redevelopment  concepting  design and operations of food and beverage venues in many of the hotels we operate  our investment in our f b venture  consisting  as of december   of certain food and beverage operations located at mondrian south beach in miami beach  our investments in hotels under development and other proposed properties  and the rights and obligations contributed to morgans group  our operating company  in the formation and structuring transactions described in note to our consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report 

table of contents we own partial interests in the joint venture hotels and the f b venture 
we account for these investments using the equity method as we believe we do not exercise control over significant asset decisions such as buying  selling or financing nor are we the primary beneficiary of the entities 
under the equity method  we increase our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures for our proportionate share of net income and contributions and decrease our investment balance for our proportionate share of net losses and distributions 
our joint venture hotels and managed hotels as of december  are operated under long term management agreements  which expire between and and may be extended subject to extension options  as more fully described in item properties managed operations 
we have also signed management agreements to manage various other hotels  including a mondrian project in doha  qatar  a mondrian project in the bahamas  a mondrian project in london  a mondrian project in istanbul  turkey  a delano project in cabo san lucas  mexico  a delano project on the aegean sea in turkey  and a hotel project in the highline area in new york city 
however  financing has not been obtained for some of these hotel projects  and there can be no assurances that all of these projects will be developed as planned 
our hotel management agreements may be subject to early termination in specified circumstances 
for example  our hotel management agreements for royalton and morgans contain performance tests that stipulate certain minimum levels of operating performance 
these performance test provisions provide us the option to fund a shortfall in operating performance 
if we choose not to fund the shortfall  the hotel owner has the option to terminate the management agreement 
as of december   approximately million was recorded in accrued expenses and as a reduction to management fees related to these performance test provisions 
tlg s management agreements may be subject to early termination in specified circumstances 
for example  all of the management agreements contain  among other covenants  a performance test that stipulates a minimum level of operating performance  and restrictions as to certain requirements of suitability  capacity  compliance with laws and material terms  financial stability  and that certain named representatives must remain employed by or under contract to tlg 
several of our hotels are also subject to substantial mortgage and mezzanine debt  and in some instances our management fee is subordinated to the debt  and our management agreements may be terminated by the lenders on foreclosure or certain other related events 
for example  mondrian soho and ames both recently experienced cash shortfalls after payment of the debt service during their seasonally slow first quarter 
to date in  we have funded approximately million in cash shortfalls at mondrian soho  which have been treated in part as additional capital contributions and in part as loans from our management company subsidiary 
we do not intend to commit significant monies toward the repayment of the joint venture loans or the funding of operating deficits 
in march  the lender for the shore club mortgage initiated foreclosure proceedings against the property in us federal district court 
in october  the federal court dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction 
in november  the lender initiated foreclosure proceedings in state court 
we continue to operate the hotel pursuant to the management agreement during these proceedings 
however  there can be no assurances we will continue to operate the hotel once foreclosure proceedings are complete 
factors affecting our results of operations revenues 
changes in our hotel revenues are most easily explained by three performance indicators that are commonly used in the hospitality industry occupancy  average daily room rate adr  and revenue per available rooms revpar  which is the product of adr and average daily occupancy  but does not include food and beverage revenue  other hotel operating revenue such as telephone  parking and other guest services  or management fee revenue 

table of contents our revenues are derived from the operation of hotels  as well as the operation of nightclub  restaurant and bar venues 
specifically  our revenue consists of rooms revenue 
occupancy and adr are the major drivers of rooms revenue 
food and beverage revenue 
most of our food and beverage revenue is driven by occupancy of our hotels and the popularity of our bars and restaurants with our local customers 
in june  we acquired from affiliates of cgm the interests cgm owned in our prior food and beverage joint ventures at delano south beach  mondrian south beach  mondrian los angeles  morgans  sanderson and st martins lane for million 
as a result of the cgm transaction  we have begun to record of the food and beverage revenue  and related expenses  for our owned f b operations 
other hotel revenue 
other hotel revenue  which consists of ancillary revenue such as telephone  parking  spa  entertainment and other guest services  is principally driven by hotel occupancy 
management fee revenue and other income 
we earn hotel management fees under our hotel management agreements 
these fees may include management fees as well as reimbursement for allocated chain services 
additionally  we own a controlling investment in tlg  a leading lifestyle food and beverage management company  which operates numerous venues in las vegas pursuant to management agreements with mgm 
the primary assets of tlg consist of its management and similar agreements with various mgm affiliates 
each of tlg s venues is managed by an affiliate of tlg  which receives revenue based on a revenue sharing arrangement 
through our ownership of tlg  we recognize management fees in accordance with the applicable management agreement  which generally provides for base management fees as a percentage of gross sales  as defined  and incentive management fees as a percentage of net profits  as defined 
under tlg s management agreements  all costs associated with the construction  build out  ff e  operating supplies  equipment and daily operational expenses are borne by each respective mgm affiliate 
fluctuations in revenues  which tend to correlate with changes in gross domestic product  are driven largely by general economic and local market conditions but can also be impacted by major events  such as terrorist attacks or natural disasters  which in turn affect levels of business and leisure travel 
the seasonal nature of the hospitality business can also impact revenues 
for example  our miami hotels are generally strongest in the first quarter  whereas our new york hotels are generally strongest in the fourth quarter 
however  given the recent global economic downturn  the impact of seasonality in and  was not as significant as in prior periods and may remain less pronounced into depending on the timing and strength of the economic recovery 
in addition to economic conditions  supply is another important factor that can affect revenues 
room rates  occupancy and food and beverage revenues tend to fall when supply increases  unless the supply growth is offset by an equal or greater increase in demand 
one reason why we focus on boutique hotels in key gateway cities is because these markets have significant barriers to entry for new competitive supply  including scarcity of available land for new development and extensive regulatory requirements resulting in a longer development lead time and additional expense for new competitors 
additionally  through our strategic relationship with mgm  we believe that the impact of competitive new supply on our food and beverage operations in las vegas may be minimized  as we offer nightlife and food and beverage venues at highly visible and visited locations on the las vegas strip 
finally  competition within the hospitality industry  which includes our hotels and our restaurants  nightclubs  bars and other food and beverage venues  can affect revenues 
competitive factors in the hospitality industry include name recognition  quality of service  convenience of location  quality of the property or venue  pricing  and range and quality of nightlife  food and beverage services and amenities offered 
in addition  all of our hotels  restaurants  nightclubs and bars are located in areas where there are numerous competitors  many of whom have substantially greater resources than us 
new or existing competitors could offer significantly lower 
table of contents rates and pricing or more convenient locations  services or amenities or significantly expand  improve or introduce new service offerings in markets in which our hotels  restaurants  nightclubs  bars  and other food and beverage venues compete  thereby posing a greater competitive threat than at present 
if we are unable to compete effectively  we would lose market share  which could adversely affect our revenues 
operating costs and expenses 
our operating costs and expenses consist of the costs to provide hotel and food and beverage services  costs to operate our hotel and food and beverage management companies  and costs associated with the ownership of our assets  including rooms expense 
rooms expense includes the payroll and benefits for the front office  housekeeping  concierge and reservations departments and related expenses  such as laundry  rooms supplies  travel agent commissions and reservation expense 
like rooms revenue  occupancy is a major driver of rooms expense  which has a significant correlation with rooms revenue 
food and beverage expense 
similar to food and beverage revenue  occupancy of the hotels in which we operate food and beverage venues  and the popularity of our restaurants  nightclubs  bars and other food and beverage venues  are the major drivers of food and beverage expense  which has a significant correlation with food and beverage revenue 
other departmental expense 
occupancy is the major driver of other departmental expense  which includes telephone and other expenses related to the generation of other hotel revenue 
hotel selling  general and administrative expense 
hotel selling  general and administrative expense consist of administrative and general expenses  such as payroll and related costs  travel expenses and office rent  advertising and promotion expenses  comprising the payroll of the hotel sales teams  the global sales team and advertising  marketing and promotion expenses for our hotel properties  utility expense and repairs and maintenance expenses  comprising the ongoing costs to repair and maintain our hotel properties 
property taxes  insurance and other 
property taxes  insurance and other consist primarily of insurance costs and property taxes 
corporate expenses  including stock compensation 
corporate expenses consist of the cost of our corporate office  net of any cost recoveries  which consists primarily of payroll and related costs  stock based compensation expenses  office rent and legal and professional fees and costs associated with being a public company 
depreciation and amortization expense 
hotel properties are depreciated using the straight line method over estimated useful lives of years for buildings and five years for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
restructuring  development and disposal costs include costs incurred related to losses on asset disposals as part of major renovation projects  the write off of abandoned development projects resulting primarily from events generally outside management s control such as the recent tightness of the credit markets  our restructuring initiatives and severance costs related to our restructuring initiatives 
these items do not relate to the ongoing operating performance of our assets 
impairment loss on receivables from unconsolidated joint ventures includes impairment costs incurred related to receivables deemed uncollectible 
other items interest expense  net 
interest expense  net includes interest on our debt and amortization of financing costs and is presented net of interest income and interest capitalized 
equity in income loss of unconsolidated joint ventures 
equity in income loss of unconsolidated joint ventures constitutes our share of the net profits and losses of our joint venture hotels  our f b venture and our investments in hotels under development 
further  we and our joint venture partners review our joint venture hotels and f b venture for other than temporary declines in market value 

table of contents in this analysis of fair value  we use discounted cash flow analysis to estimate the fair value of our investment taking into account expected cash flow from operations  holding period and net proceeds from the dispositions of the property 
any decline that is not expected to be recovered is considered other than temporary and an impairment charge is recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the investment 
gain on asset sales 
we recorded deferred gains of approximately million  million and million  respectively  related to the sales of royalton  morgans and mondrian los angeles  and a deferred gain of approximately million related to the sale of our ownership interest in the entity that owned of sanderson and st martins lane  as discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements 
as we have significant continuing involvement with these hotels through long term management agreements  the gains on sales are deferred and recognized over the initial term of the related management agreement 
other non operating income expenses include costs associated with executive terminations not related to restructuring initiatives  costs of financings  litigation and settlement costs and other items that relate to the financing and investing activities associated with our assets and not to the ongoing operating performance of our assets  both consolidated and unconsolidated  as well as the change in fair market value during of our warrants issued in connection with the yucaipa transaction 
income tax expense benefit 
all of our foreign subsidiaries are subject to local jurisdiction corporate income taxes 
income tax expense is reported at the applicable rate for the periods presented 
we are subject to federal and state income taxes 
income taxes for the years ended december   and were computed using our calculated effective tax rate 
we also recorded net deferred taxes related to cumulative differences in the basis recorded for certain assets and liabilities 
we established a reserve on the deferred tax assets based on the ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards 
noncontrolling interest 
noncontrolling interest constitutes the percentage of membership units in morgans group  our operating company  owned by residual hotel interest llc  our former parent  as discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements  as well as our third party food and beverage joint venture partner s interest in the profits and losses of our f b venture 
income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax 
in march  the mortgage lender foreclosed on mondrian scottsdale and we were terminated as the property s manager 
as such  we have recorded the income or loss earned from mondrian scottsdale in the income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax  on the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in january  we recognized income from the transfer of the property across the street from delano south beach 
preferred stock dividends and accretion 
dividends attributable to our outstanding preferred stock and the accretion of the fair value discount on the issuance of the preferred stock are reflected as adjustments to our net loss to arrive at net loss attributable to common stockholders  as discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements 
most categories of variable operating expenses  such as operating supplies  and certain labor  such as housekeeping  fluctuate with changes in occupancy 
increases in revpar attributable to increases in occupancy are accompanied by increases in most categories of variable operating costs and expenses 
increases in revpar attributable to improvements in adr typically only result in increases in limited categories of operating costs and expenses  primarily credit card and travel agent commissions 
thus  improvements in adr have a more significant impact on improving our operating margins than occupancy 
notwithstanding our efforts to reduce variable costs  there are limits to how much we can accomplish because we have significant costs that are relatively fixed costs  such as depreciation and amortization  labor costs and employee benefits  insurance  real estate taxes  interest and other expenses associated with owning hotels that do not necessarily decrease when circumstances such as market factors cause a reduction in our hotel revenues 

table of contents recent trends and developments recent trends 
starting in the fourth quarter of and continuing throughout  the weakened us and global economies resulted in considerable negative pressure on both consumer and business spending 
as a result  lodging demand and revenues  which are primarily driven by growth in gdp  business investment and employment growth weakened substantially during this period as compared to the lodging demand and revenues we experienced prior to the fourth quarter of after this extremely difficult recessionary period  the outlook for the us and global economies improved in and that improvement continued in however  to date  the recovery has not been particularly robust  as spending by businesses and consumers remains restrained  and there are still several trends which make our performance difficult to forecast  including shorter booking lead times at our hotels 
the pace of new lodging supply has increased over the past several years as many projects initiated before the economic downturn came to fruition 
for example  we witnessed new competitive luxury and boutique properties opening between and in some of our markets  particularly in los angeles  miami beach and new york  which have impacted our performance in these markets and may continue to do so 
however  we believe the timing of additional new development projects may be affected by ongoing uncertain economic conditions  which may slow down the pace of new supply development  including our own  in the next few years 
we experienced positive business trends in  with improvement in demand and average daily rate compared to the prior year in most of our major markets 
for the year ended december   as compared to  we generally experienced increases in average daily rate resulting in increases in revpar performance at all of our hotels 
however  during the fourth quarter of  we experienced some market specific softening in demand 
for example  in london and new york  our results were affected by the debt crisis and related macroeconomic factors in europe  renovations at hudson  discussed further below  and the closure of the asia de cuba restaurant at morgans 
at the same time  operating results were strong in san francisco and in miami  with the exception of delano south beach  which was under renovation during the quarter  as discussed further below 
through these uncertain times  our strategy and focus continues to be to preserve profit margins by maximizing revenue  increasing our market share and managing costs 
our strategy includes re energizing our food and beverage offerings by taking action to improve key facilities with a focus on driving higher beverage to food ratios and re igniting the buzz around our nightlife and lobby scenes 
additionally  during  we intend to spend approximately million on completing the renovations at delano south beach and hudson  which began in the third and fourth quarters of  respectively 
in february  we completed a million renovation at delano south beach  some of which was spent in  which boasts upgraded exclusive bungalows and suites  improved public areas  including the pool  restaurant and bar space  and additional meeting space 
at hudson  we intend to spend approximately million in total to completely renovate all hotel rooms and corridors and to convert a minimum of sro units into guest rooms at an estimated cost of approximately  per room 
hudson s renovation is scheduled to be completed by the end of the third quarter of to date  we have completed the renovation of guest rooms and anticipate having half the hotel rooms completed in may we are also reviewing our plans for the food and beverage venues at hudson 
we expect that these renovations at our owned hotels will have positive ebitda impacts once completed 
for  we believe that if various economic forecasts projecting continued modest expansion are accurate  this may lead to a gradual and modest increase in lodging demand for both leisure and business travel  although we expect there to be continued pressure on rates  as leisure and business travelers alike continue to focus on cost containment 
as such  there can be no assurances that any increases in hotel revenues or earnings at our properties will occur  or be sustained  or that any losses will not increase for these or any other reasons 
recent developments 
in addition to the recent trends described above  we expect that a number of recent events will cause our future results of operations to differ from our historical performance

strong corporate travel  particularly in new york  was a key factor in the increase 
food and beverage revenue decreased to million in compared to million in the decrease was primarily attributable to a decline in food and beverage revenue at hudson during the year as compared to  as the hotel s primary restaurant was closed and the new restaurant  hudson hall  opened in late may food and beverage revenue was also down at royalton  as the restaurant was closed for part of the third quarter of for renovation and re concepting 
the new royalton restaurant  forty four  opened in early october other hotel revenue decreased to million in compared to million in the slight decrease is primarily due to decreased revenues related to ancillary services  such as our spas at delano south beach and mondrian los angeles  as guests are still spending conservatively in light of the uncertain economic recovery 
offsetting this decrease  newly installed wireless infrastructures at certain of our owned hotels contributed to an increase in internet revenues 
management fee related parties and other income increased by to million in compared to million in this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in management fees earned at hard rock due to the property expansion project that was underway during and resulted in new rooms that opened in july and an additional new rooms that opened in december additionally  an increase also occurred due to management fees earned at ames  which opened in november  the san juan water and beach club  which we began managing in october  and hotel las palapas  which we began managing in december operating costs and expenses rooms expense increased to million in compared to million in this increase is a direct result of the increase in rooms revenue attributed to increased occupancy 
we implemented cost cutting initiatives at our hotels in and early food and beverage expense increased to million in compared to million in this increase is primarily due to a increase in expenses at royalton as a result of increased expenses related to the re concepting of the restaurant  including promotion costs  and an increase in state unemployment taxes as a result of the staff level restructuring implemented in offsetting this increase is a decrease in food and beverage expenses at hudson as a result of the primary restaurant being closed from january to may for re concepting and renovation  as discussed above  and a slight decrease at clift  where we re concepted the restaurant venue beginning in early and began operating it directly  rather than through our restaurant joint venture  resulting in cost savings 

table of contents other departmental expense decreased to million in compared to million in this decrease is consistent with cost saving initiatives implemented in and hotel selling  general and administrative expense increased to million in compared to million in this increase was primarily due to increased sales and marketing expenses incurred in property taxes  insurance and other expense decreased to million in compared to million in this decrease was primarily due to property tax refunds at three of our new york hotels received during for which there were no comparable refunds received in the same period in corporate expenses  including stock compensation increased by to million in compared to million in this increase is primarily due to restored bonus accruals to more normalized levels during the year as compared to depreciation and amortization increased to million in as compared to million in this increase is primarily the result of depreciation on capital improvements required to maintain our existing hotels incurred during and increased depreciation expense related to the lower level expansion at hudson  good units  and the restaurant re concepting  hudson hall  both of which occurred during the first half of restructuring  development and disposal costs decreased to million in as compared to million in this decrease in expense is primarily related to the write off of certain development expenses related to our investment in mondrian south beach in for which there was no comparable expense in impairment loss on receivables from unconsolidated joint venture was million in for which there was no comparable loss in the same period in we impaired these outstanding receivables due from hard rock  as management concluded that collection of these receivables was uncertain 
we released this receivable on march  as part of the general release signed in connection with the hard rock settlement agreement 
interest expense  net decreased to million in compared to million in this decrease is primarily due to decreased interest expense recognized as a result of the expiration in july of certain interest rate swaps related to the loans secured by the hudson and mondrian los angeles at that time  hotels which had fixed our interest expense on those loans at a much higher rate than the then current libor rates 
equity in loss of unconsolidated joint ventures decreased to a loss of million in compared to a loss of million in this change was primarily a result of the million impairment charge we recognized on our investment in echelon las vegas in for which there was no comparable impairment charge in during  we recognized a million impairment charge on our investment in mondrian soho 
slightly offsetting the impairment charges recognized in were increases in equity in income recognized from the london joint venture which owned sanderson and st martins lane 
the components of revpar from our comparable joint venture hotels for and  which included sanderson  st martins lane  shore club  and mondrian south beach  but excluded the hard rock  which was under renovation and expansion during  ames in boston  which opened in november  and san juan water and beach club in isla verde  puerto rico  which we began managing in the fourth quarter of  are summarized as follows in constant dollars change change occupancy adr revpar

like most operators of hotels in the non gaming lodging industry  we do not follow this practice at our other hotels  where we present average occupancy rate and average daily rate net of rooms provided on a complimentary basis 
other non operating expense income was an expense of million in compared to income of million in the change was primarily the result of the loss on change in fair market value of the warrants issued to the investors in connection with the series a preferred securities during for further discussion  see notes and of our consolidated financial statements 
income tax expense benefit resulted in a benefit of million in compared to a benefit of million in we recorded an additional valuation allowance of million against the tax benefit for the year ended december  income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax resulted in a gain of million in compared to a loss of million in this change was primarily a result of the million gain on disposal of mondrian scottsdale in as compared to an impairment charge of million in on mondrian scottsdale and the transfer of our ownership interests in the property across the street from delano south beach to a third party  which resulted in a loss 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  and the amount of borrowings available under our new revolving credit facility was million 
as of december   total restricted cash was million 
we have both short term and long term liquidity requirements as described in more detail below 
liquidity requirements short term liquidity requirements 
we generally consider our short term liquidity requirements to consist of those items that are expected to be incurred by us or our consolidated subsidiaries within the next months and believe those requirements currently consist primarily of funds necessary to pay operating expenses and other expenditures directly associated with our properties  including the funding of our reserve accounts  capital commitments associated with certain of our development projects and existing hotels  and our planned renovations at hudson and delano south beach 
we are obligated to maintain reserve funds for capital expenditures at our owned hotels as determined pursuant to our debt or lease agreements related to such hotels  with the exception of delano south beach 
our joint venture hotels and our managed hotels generally are subject to similar obligations under our management agreements or under debt agreements related to such hotels 
these capital expenditures relate primarily to the periodic replacement or refurbishment of furniture  fixtures and equipment 
such agreements typically require us to reserve funds at amounts equal to of the hotel s revenues and require the funds to be set aside in restricted cash 
in addition  our f b venture requires between to of gross revenues of the restaurant of restricted cash to be to set aside for future replacement or refurbishment of furniture  fixtures and equipment 

table of contents we intend to utilize the majority of our liquidity to fund growth and development efforts  renovations at existing hotels and infrastructure improvements 
we are focused on growing our portfolio  primarily with our core brands  in major gateway markets and key resort destinations 
in august  we entered into a hotel management and residential licensing agreement for a room mondrian branded hotel  to be the lifestyle hotel destination in the  acre destination resort metropolis  baha mar resort  in nassau  the bahamas 
the hotel is scheduled to open in late we are required to fund approximately million of key money just prior to and at opening of the hotel 
we have a million standby letter of credit outstanding on the delano credit facility for up to months to cover this obligation 
also in december  we announced a new hotel management agreement for an approximately room mondrian branded hotel to be located in the old city area of istanbul  turkey 
the hotel is scheduled to open in in december and january  we contributed an aggregate of million in the form of equity and key money and will have a ownership interest in the venture owning the hotel 
we have no additional funding commitments in connection with this project 
beginning in the third quarter of and continuing into early  we spent approximately million  of which million was spent in  on projects at delano south beach to upgrade the exclusive bungalows and suites  improve public areas  including the pool  restaurant and bar space  and create additional meeting space 
we intend to spend approximately million at hudson to upgrade hudson rooms with new furniture and fixtures  lighting and technology  and completely renovate the hotel corridors and to convert a minimum of sro units into guest rooms at a cost of approximately  per room  significantly below recent trading prices of hotel rooms in new york city 
this renovation work commenced during the fourth quarter of and is scheduled to continue through september we are also reviewing plans for the food and beverage venues at hudson 
we have a number of capital projects at our owned and managed hotels under consideration at our discretion 
for example  in we intend to analyze our current food and beverage offerings and may commit resources to re concepting certain restaurants  bars and nightclubs 
in addition to reserve funds for capital expenditures  our owned hotels debt and lease agreements also require us to deposit cash into escrow accounts for taxes  insurance and debt service or lease payments 
historically  we have satisfied our liquidity requirements through various sources of capital  including borrowings under our revolving credit facility  our existing working capital  cash provided by operations  equity and debt offerings  and long term mortgages on our properties 
other sources may include cash generated through asset dispositions and joint venture transactions 
additionally  we may secure other financing opportunities 
given the uncertain economic environment and continuing difficult conditions in the credit markets  however  we may not be able to obtain such financings  or succeed in selling any assets  on terms acceptable to us or at all 
we may require additional borrowings to satisfy these liquidity requirements 
see also other liquidity matters below for additional liquidity that may be required in the short term  depending on market and other circumstances 
long term liquidity requirements 
we generally consider our long term liquidity requirements to consist of those items that are expected to be incurred by us or our consolidated subsidiaries beyond the next months and believe these requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay scheduled debt maturities  renovations and other non recurring capital expenditures that need to be made periodically to our properties and the costs associated with acquisitions and development of properties under contract and new acquisitions and development projects that we may pursue 
our series a preferred securities have an dividend rate until october   a dividend rate from october  to october   and a dividend rate thereafter 
the cumulative unpaid 
table of contents dividends also have a dividend rate equal to the dividend rate on the series a preferred securities 
we have the option to accrue any and all dividend payments  and as of december   have not declared any dividends 
as of december   we have undeclared dividends of approximately million 
we have the option to redeem any or all of the series a preferred securities at any time 
other long term liquidity requirements include our obligations under our convertible notes  which mature in october  hudson mortgage debt  which matures in august with three one year extension options  delano credit facility  which expires in july  tlg promissory notes  which mature in november  trust preferred securities  and the clift lease  each as described under debt 
historically  we have satisfied our long term liquidity requirements through various sources of capital  including our existing working capital  cash provided by operations  equity and debt offerings  and long term mortgages on our properties 
other sources may include cash generated through asset dispositions and joint venture transactions 
additionally  we may secure other financing opportunities  restructure our outstanding debt or preferred securities  and from time to time may seek to repurchase our outstanding debt securities in open market transactions or otherwise 
given the uncertain economic environment and continuing challenging conditions in the credit markets  however  we may not be able to obtain such financings on terms acceptable to us or at all 
we may require additional borrowings to satisfy our long term liquidity requirements 
we anticipate we will need to renovate clift in the next few years  which will require capital and will most likely be funded by equity contributions  debt financing  possible asset sales  future operating cash flows or a combination of these sources 
additionally  as our new managed hotels are developed  to the extent we have committed to contribute key money  these amounts will come due prior to the hotel opening 
in when the development is completed  we anticipate we will contribute approximately million  or approximately million  and million  respectively  toward our key money investments in mondrian london and in mondrian at baha mar 
the key money investment in mondrian at baha mar has been secured by a letter of credit 
financing for some of our development projects has not yet been identified 
given the uncertain economic environment and continuing challenging conditions in the credit markets  these and other projects may not be able to obtain adequate project financing in a timely manner or at all 
if adequate project financing is not obtained  these projects may need to be limited in scope  deferred or cancelled altogether  and to the extent we have previously funded key money on a cancelled project  we may be unable to recover the amounts funded 
although the credit and equity markets remain challenging  we believe that these sources of capital will become available to us in the future to fund our long term liquidity requirements 
however  our ability to incur additional debt is dependent upon a number of factors  including our degree of leverage  borrowing restrictions imposed by existing lenders and general market conditions 
we will continue to analyze which source of capital is most advantageous to us at any particular point in time 
other liquidity matters in addition to our expected short term and long term liquidity requirements  our liquidity could also be affected by potential liquidity matters at our joint venture hotels  as discussed below

the promissory notes were allocated million to mr 
sasson and million to mr 
masi collectively  the tlg promissory notes 
the maximum payment of million is based on tlg achieving ebitda of at least million from non morgans business the non morgans ebitda during the month period starting on january   with ratable reduction of the payment if less than million of non morgans ebitda is earned

joint venture debt 
see off balance sheet arrangements for descriptions of joint venture debt 

table of contents contractual obligations we have various contractual obligations that are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
we also enter into other purchase commitments and other executory contracts that are not recognized as liabilities until services are performed or goods are received 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and other commitments as of december   excluding interest  except as indicated  and debt obligations at our joint venture hotels payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year to years to years more than years in thousands mortgages liability to subsidiary trust convertible notes interest on mortgage and notes payable tlg promissory note capitalized lease obligations including amounts representing interest operating lease obligations total the table above excludes the million in letters of credit outstanding related to our investment in the room mondrian branded hotel  to be a lifestyle hotel destination in baha mar  nassau  the bahamas and excludes the million that we funded in january toward our investment in mondrian istanbul 
the table above includes certain of our owned f b operations  which lease space from hotels in which we do not have an ownership interest 
we may be obligated to make lease payments at these venues if the food and beverage operations do not cover the lease obligations 
as described in derivative financial instruments below  we use some derivative financial instruments  primarily interest rate caps  to manage our exposure to interest rate risks related to our floating rate debt 
as such  the interest rate on our debt is fixed for the majority of our outstanding debt  which is reflected in the table above 
on october   we issued  shares of series a preferred securities to the investors 
the holders of such series a preferred securities are entitled to cumulative cash dividends  payable in arrears on every three month anniversary following the original date of issuance if such dividends are declared by the board of directors or an authorized committee thereof  at a rate of per year until october   per year from october  to october   and per year thereafter

seasonality the hospitality business is seasonal in nature 
for example  our miami hotels are generally strongest in the first quarter  whereas our new york hotels are generally strongest in the fourth quarter 
quarterly revenues also may be adversely affected by events beyond our control  such as the current recession  extreme weather conditions  terrorist attacks or alerts  natural disasters  airline strikes  and other considerations affecting travel 

table of contents to help demonstrate seasonality  the table below provides room revenues by quarter for the years ended december  and for hudson and delano south beach  both of which are included in our owned hotels as of december  first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter in millions hudson room revenues first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter in millions delano south beach room revenues given the recent global economic downturn  the impact of seasonality in and was not as significant as in prior periods and may continue to be less pronounced in depending on the timing and strength of the economic recovery 
to the extent that cash flows from operations are insufficient during any quarter  due to temporary or seasonal fluctuations in revenues  we may have to enter into additional short term borrowings or increase our borrowings  if available under our delano credit facility  to meet cash requirements 
capital expenditures and reserve funds we are obligated to maintain reserve funds for capital expenditures at our owned hotels as determined pursuant to our debt or lease agreements related to such hotels  with the exception of delano south beach 
our joint venture hotels and our managed hotels generally are subject to similar obligations under our management agreements or under debt agreements related to such hotels 
these capital expenditures relate primarily to the periodic replacement or refurbishment of furniture  fixtures and equipment 
such agreements typically require the hotel owners to reserve funds at amounts equal to of the hotel s revenues and require the funds to be set aside in restricted cash 
in addition  the f b venture requires the venture to set aside restricted cash of between of gross revenues of the restaurant in and increasing annually to of gross revenues of the restaurant in and thereafter 
as of december   approximately million was available in restricted cash reserves for future capital expenditures under these obligations related to our owned hotels 
beginning in late and continuing into early  we spent approximately million  of which million was spent in  on projects at delano south beach to upgrade the exclusive bungalows and suites  improve public areas  including the pool  restaurant and bar space  and create additional meeting space 
we intend to spend a total of approximately million at hudson to upgrade guest rooms with new furniture and fixtures  lighting and technology  completely renovate the hotel corridors  and convert a minimum of sro units into guest rooms at a cost of approximately  per room  significantly below recent trading prices of hotel rooms in new york city 
this renovation work began in the fourth quarter of and is scheduled to continue through september we are also reviewing plans for the food and beverage venues at hudson 
we anticipate we will need to renovate clift in the next few years  which will require capital and will most likely be funded by equity contributions  debt financing  possible asset sales  future operating cash flows or a combination of these sources 

table of contents the hudson mortgage loan provides that  in the event the debt yield ratio falls below certain defined thresholds  all cash from the property is deposited into accounts controlled by the lenders from which debt service  operating expenses and management fees are paid and from which other reserve accounts may be funded 
any excess amounts are retained by the lenders until the debt yield ratio exceeds the required thresholds for two consecutive calendar quarters 
furthermore  if our management company subsidiary that manages hudson is not reserving sufficient funds for property tax  ground rent  insurance premiums  and capital expenditures in accordance with the hotel management agreement  then our subsidiary borrowers would be required to fund the reserve account for such purposes 
our subsidiary borrowers are not permitted to have any indebtedness other than certain permitted indebtedness customary in such transactions  including ordinary trade payables  purchase money indebtedness and capital lease obligations  subject to limits 
derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to the interest rate risks related to our variable rate debt 
we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and only enter into contracts with major financial institutions based on their credit rating and other factors 
we determine the fair value of our derivative financial instruments using models which incorporate standard market conventions and techniques such as discounted cash flow and option pricing models to determine fair value 
we believe these methods of estimating fair value result in general approximation of value  and such value may or may not be realized 
as of december   we had one interest rate cap outstanding and the fair value of this interest rate cap was insignificant 
in connection with the sale of the convertible notes  we entered into call options which are exercisable solely in connection with any conversion of the convertible notes and pursuant to which we will receive shares of our common stock from counterparties equal to the number of shares of our common stock  or other property  deliverable by us to the holders of the convertible notes upon conversion of the convertible notes  in excess of an amount of shares or other property with a value  at then current prices  equal to the principal amount of the converted convertible notes 
simultaneously  we also entered into warrant transactions  whereby we sold warrants to purchase in the aggregate  shares of our common stock  subject to customary anti dilution adjustments  at an exercise price of approximately per share of common stock 
the warrants may be exercised over a day trading period commencing january  the call options and the warrants are separate contracts and are not part of the terms of the convertible notes and will not affect the holders rights under the convertible notes 
the call options are intended to offset potential dilution upon conversion of the convertible notes in the event that the market value per share of the common stock at the time of exercise is greater than the exercise price of the call options  which is equal to the initial conversion price of the convertible notes and is subject to certain customary adjustments 
on october   we entered into a securities purchase agreement with yucaipa american alliance fund ii  lp and yucaipa american alliance parallel fund ii  lp  which we refer to collectively as the investors 
under the securities purchase agreement  we issued and sold to the investors i  shares of the our series a preferred securities   liquidation preference per share  and ii warrants to purchase  shares of the company s common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrants have a year term and are exercisable utilizing a cashless exercise method only  resulting in a net share issuance 
the exercise price and number of shares subject to the warrant are both subject to anti dilution adjustments 
we and yucaipa american alliance fund ii  llc  an affiliate of the investors  as the fund manager  also entered into a real estate fund formation agreement on october  pursuant to which we and the fund manager agreed to use good faith efforts to endeavor to raise a private investment fund 
in connection with the agreement  we issued to the fund manager  contingent warrants to purchase our common stock at an exercise price of per share with a year term 

table of contents the fund formation agreement terminated by its terms on january  due to the failure to close a fund with million of aggregate capital commitments by that date  and the  contingent warrants issued to the fund manager were forfeited in their entirety on october  due to the failure to close a fund with million of aggregate capital commitments by that date

critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience  information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the 
table of contents circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets 
when triggering events occur  we periodically review each property for possible impairment 
recoverability of such assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset  as determined by applying our operating budgets for future periods 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value 
we estimated each property s fair value using a discounted cash flow method taking into account each property s expected cash flow from operations  holding period and net proceeds from the dispositions of the property 
the factors we address in determining estimated net proceeds from disposition include anticipated operating cash flow in the year of disposition  terminal cash flow capitalization rate and selling price per room 
our judgment is required in determining the discount rate applied to estimated cash flows  the growth rate of the property revenues  and the need for capital expenditures  as well as specific market and economic conditions 
additionally  the classification of these assets as held for sale requires the recording of these assets at our estimate of their fair value less estimated selling costs which can affect the amount of impairment recorded 
as of december  and  management concluded that its long lived assets were not impaired 
impairment of goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets attributable to business acquisitions and combinations 
we test for impairment of goodwill at least annually and at year end 
we will test for impairment more frequently if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
in accordance with asu no 
 management assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that is  a likelihood of more than percent that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if this is the case  management will perform a more detailed two step goodwill impairment test which is used to identify potential goodwill impairments and to measure the amount of goodwill impairment losses to be recognized  if any 
in applying the detailed two step process  management identifies potential impairments in goodwill by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its book value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount  including goodwill  the asset is not impaired 
any excess of carrying value over the estimated fair value of goodwill would be recognized as an impairment loss in continuing operations 
management applies a discounted cash flow method to perform its annual goodwill fair value impairment test taking into account approved operating budgets with appropriate growth assumptions  holding period and proceeds from disposing of the property 
in addition to the discounted cash flow analysis  management also considers external independent appraisals to estimate fair value 
the analysis and appraisals used by management are consistent with those used by a market participant 
judgment is required in determining the discount rate applied to estimated cash flows  growth rate of the property revenues  and the need for capital expenditures  as well as specific market and economic conditions 
the discount rate and the terminal cash flow capitalization rate were based on applicable public hotel studies and market indices 
given the current economic environment  management believes that the growth assumptions applied are reasonable 
the company has one reportable operating segment  which is its reporting unit under asc  therefore management aggregates goodwill associated to all owned hotels when analyzing potential impairment 
as of december  and  management concluded that no goodwill impairment existed as qualitative factors did not indicate that the fair value of our reporting unit was less than its fair value 
management does not believe it is reasonably likely that goodwill will become impaired in future periods  but will test before the year end if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation expense is based on the estimated useful life of our assets 
the respective lives of the assets are based on a number of assumptions made by us  
table of contents including the cost and timing of capital expenditures to maintain and refurbish our hotels  as well as specific market and economic conditions 
hotel properties and other completed real estate investments are depreciated using the straight line method over estimated useful lives of years for buildings and generally five years for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
while our management believes its estimates are reasonable  a change in the estimated lives could affect depreciation expense and net income or the gain or loss on the sale of any of our hotels or other assets 
we have not changed the estimated useful lives of any of our assets during the periods discussed and believe that the future useful lives of our assets will be consistent with historical trends and experience 
derivative instruments and hedging activities 
derivative instruments and hedging activities require us to make judgments on the nature of our derivatives and their effectiveness as hedges 
these judgments determine if the changes in fair value of the derivative instruments are reported as a component of interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations or as a component of equity on the consolidated balance sheets 
while we believe our judgments are reasonable  a change in a derivative s fair value or effectiveness as a hedge could affect expenses  net income and equity 
additionally  management determines fair value of our derivatives is in accordance with asc  fair value measurements and disclosures asc 
the valuation of interest rate caps and interest rate swaps  when used  are determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative 
this analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives  including the period to maturity  and uses observable market based inputs  including interest rate curves and implied volatilities 
to comply with the provisions of asc  we incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements 
in adjusting the fair value of its derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk  management has considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements  such as collateral postings  thresholds  mutual puts  and guarantees 
management believes that the valuation approach is acceptable and that our derivatives are properly stated at december  and consolidation policy 
variable interest entities are accounted for within the scope of asc and are required to be consolidated by their primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary at a variable interest entity is the enterprise that has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the variable interest entity s economic performance and obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the variable interest entity that could be potentially significant to the variable interest entity 
we evaluate our interests in accordance with asc  consolidation asc to determine if they are variable interests in variable interest entities 
significant judgments and assumptions are made by us to determine whether an entity is a variable interest entity such as those regarding the sufficiency of an entity s equity at risk and whether the entity s equity holders have the power through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact its economic performance 
we have evaluated the applicability of asc to our investments in unconsolidated hotel joint ventures and our food and beverage operation at a joint venture hotel  mondrian south beach 
we have determined that most of these joint ventures do not meet the requirements of a variable interest entity and some of the ventures meet the requirements of a variable interest entity of which we are not the primary beneficiary and therefore  consolidation of these ventures is not required 
we account for these investments using the equity method as we believe we do not exercise control over significant asset decisions such as buying  selling or financing nor are we the primary beneficiary of the entities 
under the equity method  we increase our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures for our proportionate share of net income and contributions and decrease our investment balance for our proportionate share of net loss and distributions 
assets held for sale 
in accordance with asc  property  plant  and equipment  other presentation matters  we consider properties to be assets held for sale when management approves and commits to a formal plan to actively market a property or a group of properties for sale and the sale is probable 
upon designation as an asset held for sale  we record the carrying value of each property or 
table of contents group of properties at the lower of its carrying value  which includes allocable goodwill  or its estimated fair value  less estimated costs to sell  and we stop recording depreciation expense 
any gain realized in connection with the sale of the properties for which we have significant continuing involvement  such as through a long term management agreement  is deferred and recognized over the initial term of the related management agreement 
the operations of the properties held for sale prior to the sale date are recorded in discontinued operations unless we have continuing involvement  such as through a management agreement  after the sale 
business combinations 
in accordance with asc  business combinations  we recognize identifiable assets acquired  liabilities both specific and contingent assumed  and non controlling interests in a business combination at their fair values at the acquisition date based on the exit price ie the price that would be received to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
furthermore  acquisition related costs  such as due diligence  legal and accounting fees  are not capitalized or applied in determining the fair value of the acquired assets 
in certain situations  a deferred tax liability is created due to the difference between the fair value and the tax basis of the acquired asset at the acquisition date  which also may result in a goodwill asset being recorded 
stock based compensation 
we have adopted the fair value method of accounting prescribed in asc  compensation  stock based compensation asc for equity based compensation awards 
asc requires an estimate of the fair value of the equity award at the time of grant rather than the intrinsic value method 
for all fixed equity based awards to employees and directors  which have no vesting conditions other than time of service  the fair value of the equity award at the grant date will be amortized to compensation expense over the award s vesting period on a straight line basis 
for performance based compensation plans  we recognize compensation expense at such time when the performance hurdle is anticipated to be achieved over the performance period based upon the fair value at the date of grant 
the fair value is determined based on the value of our common stock on the grant date of the award  in the case of stock option awards  the black scholes option pricing model  or in the case of outperformance long term incentive units  or opp ltip units  the monte carlo simulation method 
management s assumptions when applying the black scholes model are derived based upon the risk profile and volatility of our common stock and our peer group 
the monte carlo simulation uses a statistical formula underlying the black scholes and binomial formulas and such simulation is run approximately  times 
for each simulation  the payoff is calculated at the settlement date  which is then discounted to the award date at a risk free interest rate 
the average of the values over all simulations is the expected value of the unit on the award date 
assumptions used in the valuations include factors associated with the underlying performance of the company s stock price and total shareholder return over the term of the performance awards including total stock return volatility and risk free interest 
we believe that the assumptions that we have applied to stock based compensation are reasonable and we will continue to review such assumptions quarterly and revise them as market conditions change and management deems necessary 
deferred income taxes and valuation allowance 
we account for deferred taxes by recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance will be provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
such valuation allowance will be estimated by management based on our projected future taxable income 
the estimate of future taxable income is highly subjective 
we have a net operating loss for the tax year and anticipate that all or a major portion of the net operating loss will be utilized to offset any future gains on sale of assets 
however  these assumptions may prove to be inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur in the 
table of contents future 
to the extent actual results differ from these estimates  our future results of operations may be affected 
at december  and  we had a million and million valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  respectively 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our future income  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates 
market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
some of our outstanding debt has a variable interest rate 
as described in management s discussion and analysis of financial results of operations derivative financial instruments above  we use some derivative financial instruments  primarily interest rate caps  to manage our exposure to interest rate risks related to our floating rate debt 
we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and only enter into contracts with major financial institutions based on their credit rating and other factors 
as of december   our total outstanding consolidated debt  including capital lease obligations  was approximately million  of which approximately million  or  was variable rate debt 
at december   the one month libor rate was 
as of december   the million of variable rate debt consisted of our outstanding balance on the hudson mortgage loan 
in connection with the hudson mortgage loan  an interest rate cap for in the amount of approximately million  the full amount available under the mortgage after certain hurdles are met  as discussed above in debt  was entered into in august  and was outstanding as of december  this interest rate cap matures in august as of december   we have million outstanding on the hudson mortgage loan 
if market rates of interest on this million variable rate debt increase by  or basis points  the increase in interest expense would reduce future pre tax earnings and cash flows by approximately million annually and the maximum annual amount the interest expense would increase on this variable rate debt is million due to our interest rate cap agreement  which would reduce future pre tax earnings and cash flows by the same amount annually 
if market rates of interest on this million variable rate decrease by  the decrease in interest expense would increase pre tax earnings and cash flow by approximately million annually 
as of december   our fixed rate debt  excluding our hudson capital lease obligation  of million consisted of the trust notes underlying our trust preferred securities  the convertible notes  the clift lease  and the tlg promissory notes 
the fair value of some of this debt is greater than the book value 
as such  if market rates of interest increase by  or approximately basis points  the fair value of our fixed rate debt at december  would decrease by approximately million 
if market rates of interest decrease by  or basis points  the fair value of our fixed rate debt at december  would increase by million 
interest risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments and future cash flows 
these analyses do not consider the effect of a reduced level of overall economic activity 
if overall economic activity is significantly reduced  we may take actions to further mitigate our exposure 
however  because we cannot determine the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  these analyses assume no changes in our financial structure 
we have entered into agreements with each of our derivative counterparties in connection with our interest rate caps and hedging instruments related to the convertible notes  providing that in the event we either default or are capable of being declared in default on any of our indebtedness  then we could also be declared in default on our derivative obligations 

table of contents currency exchange risk as we have international operations at hotels that we manage in london and mexico  currency exchange risks between the us dollar and the british pound and the us dollar and mexican peso  respectively  arise as a normal part of our business 
we reduce these risks by transacting these businesses in their local currency 
generally  we do not enter into forward or option contracts to manage our exposure applicable to day to day net operating cash flows 
we do not foresee any significant changes in either our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates or how such exposure is managed in the future  with the exception of the sale of our interests in our two london hotels  in connection with which we entered into a foreign currency forward contract due to the material nature of the transaction
