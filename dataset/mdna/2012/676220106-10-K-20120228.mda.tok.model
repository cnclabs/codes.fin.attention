a summary of factors important to understanding our results for is provided below 
the comparisons to prior years are discussed in the narrative that follows this overview 
total company sales were billion in  down compared to total company sales decreased in compared to sales for declined in the north american retail division and in the north american business solutions division 
comparable store sales in the north american retail division decreased 
international division sales decreased in us dollars and in constant currencies 
gross margin for improved approximately basis points compared to  following an approximately basis point increase from the increase in primarily reflects improvement from reduced promotional activity  lower property costs and changes in the mix of sales channels and products sold

tax and related interest benefits of approximately million were recognized in from the reversal of uncertain tax position accruals and the release of valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions based on positive earnings 
tax settlements and related interest reversal were also recognized in the company continues to operate in the us with full valuation allowances on deferred tax assets  contributing to significant effective tax rate volatility within the year and across years

table of contents north american retail division dollars in millions sales change division operating profit of sales sales in our north american retail division decreased in  in and in the decline in sales reflects the closing of stores in canada during and  in  the closing of underperforming stores as part of a strategic business review 
comparable store sales in from the  stores that were open for more than one year decreased  with the fourth quarter down compared to the prior year 
comparable store sales in from the  stores that were open for more than one year decreased 
the rd week in added approximately million to the division s full year reported sales 
transaction counts were lower in both and  consistent with the comparable store sales declines 
sales in technology services  copy and print depot  seating and office materials increased in compared to  while sales of technology products  technology peripheral items and some office supplies declined 
sales in furniture  technology  technology services and copy and print depot increased in compared to  sales of supplies declined 
our decision to reduce promotions in select categories contributed to lower sales in both and the north american retail division reported operating profit of approximately million in  million in and million in division operating profit in included approximately million of charges associated with the closure of stores in canada 
charges for store closures in were managed at the corporate level and not reflected in the determination of division operating profit 
gross margins increased in from a change in the mix of sales away from technology products and lower promotional activity  as well as continuing benefits from lower occupancy costs 
gross margins in also benefited from lower promotional activity and lower product cost driven by line reviews and increased sales of direct import products 
operating profit in included severance and other costs associated with the store closures in canada  higher variable based pay and incremental costs incurred to drive increased customer focused selling activities 
these factors were offset by a positive contribution from the rd week in  decreased advertising expenses and other favorable items including benefits recognized from changes to our private label credit card program 
advertising expense increased in compared to and was partially offset by lower variable based pay 
division operating profit in all periods was negatively affected by the unfavorable impact our sales volume decline had on gross margin and operating expenses the flow through impact 
at the end of  we operated  retail stores in the us we opened new stores during and stores during we closed stores in north america during  including the stores in canada  and during we will continue to evaluate locations as leases become due and will close or relocate stores when appropriate 
north american business solutions division dollars in millions sales change division operating profit of sales sales in our north american business solutions division decreased in  in and in the rd week added approximately million of sales to the division in sales in the direct channel increased in and decreased in sales in the contract channel were lower in both years 
for the division 
table of contents in total  both the number of customer transactions and the average order value per transaction were lower in and  in part reflecting reductions in promotional activity 
during  through alternative non exclusive purchasing arrangements  the division retained approximately of the revenue from customers formerly associated with a legacy public sector purchasing cooperative 
this retention rate is inclusive of declines due to public sector spending and budget constraints  which impacted these customers as well as our other public sector customers 
sales in the contract channel  other than to customers buying under these purchasing arrangements  were positive for sales to small to medium sized businesses and sales to large national accounts increased during on a product category basis in  sales of cleaning and break room products and certain office supplies increased while ink and toner  furniture  paper and other office supply categories decreased 
in  the division experienced weakness in durables such as furniture  technology and peripherals  as customers delayed their purchases of these products in favor of consumables like paper  ink and toner 
division operating profit totaled million in  million in  and million in the increase in division operating profit reflects gross margin benefits from reduced promotions  the impact of a change in the mix of product sales to the direct channel  lower operating expenses  a change of mix of customers in the contract channel  and positive impacts from our margin improvement initiatives 
lower selling  distribution and advertising expenses were incurred in compared to many of these operating expense reductions reflect initiatives put in place in prior periods to improve efficiency and productivity 
also  fiscal year included benefits discrete to the period from removing recourse provisions and changing terms and conditions in the office depot private label credit card program and adjustments relating to customer incentives 
variable based pay linked to performance was higher in the impact of the rd week was relatively neutral to the division s overall operating profit for the decrease in operating profit was partially offset by higher gross margins from a shift in the mix of customers  some pricing improvements and product mix 
increased advertising expenses during were offset by initiatives to reduce the division s cost structure and lower variable pay for the period 
the flow through impact of lower sales adversely affected all periods  with the greatest impact in international division dollars in millions sales change change in constant currency sales division operating profit of sales sales in our international division in us dollars decreased in  in and in constant currency sales decreased in  in and in excluding the revenue impact from the fourth quarter dispositions of businesses in israel and japan and the deconsolidation of business in india  as well as the first quarter acquisition of a business in sweden the portfolio changes  constant currency sales were lower in compared to the rd week added approximately million to total division sales 
contract channel sales in constant currencies increased in and in the increase reflects growth in field sales as a result of staff added in the last two years  as well as the acquisition 
constant currency sales in the direct business declined in  after considering the portfolio changes  and declined in division operating profit totaled approximately million in  million in  and million in included in division operating profit for and were charges of approximately million and million  respectively 
the charges primarily relate to severance and other costs associated with facility closures and streamlining processes 
the charges resulted from the sale of operating subsidiaries in israel and japan  as well as facility closure and severance costs associated with consolidation arrangements in europe 

table of contents the subsidiary sales reflect the company s decision to change its investment model in those countries from direct operations to continued cash flow from product sales and other arrangements 
the company anticipates recognizing additional charges in as operational consolidation continues and the related accounting recognition criteria are met 
the decreases in division operating profit in  and were impacted by the flow through impact of lower sales levels 
gross profit as a percent of sales increased in  but decreased after considering the portfolio changes 
this decrease reflects a change in the mix of direct and contract sales  product costs not passed along to customers  and a negative impact of the rd week  partially offset by lower occupancy costs 
operating expenses decreased across the division  reflecting benefits from restructuring activities initiated in prior periods 
the operating profit comparison of to also reflects higher vendor rebates in and higher product costs in that were not passed on to customers  partially offset by lower variable based pay 
for  the negative flow through impact was partially offset by lower operating expenses  including a decrease in distribution costs as well as lower payroll and advertising expenses 
for us reporting  the international division s sales are translated into us dollars at average exchange rates experienced during the year 
the division s reported sales were positively impacted by approximately million in  negatively impacted by million in and positively impacted by million in from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
division operating profit was positively impacted by million in  negatively impacted by million in and negatively impacted by million in from changes in foreign exchange rates 
internally  we analyze our international operations in terms of local currency performance to allow focus on operating trends and results 
corporate and other asset impairments  exit costs and other charges in recent years  the company has taken actions to adapt to changing and increasingly competitive conditions experienced in the markets in which we serve 
these actions include closing stores and distribution centers dcs  consolidating functional activities  disposing of businesses and assets  and taking actions to improve process efficiencies 
significant charges and impairments have been recognized associated with these activities 
the charges and impairments recognized in related to a strategic review and were managed at the corporate level charges and not considered in determining division operating profit 
the charges and impairments recognized in and associated with facility closures  consolidating functions and process improvements were either included in the determination of division operating profit or as corporate costs  depending on the underlying activity 
store level impairments and store closure costs  unrelated to the actions discussed above  are included in determination of division operating profit and are not included in the tables below 
the amount of charges and impairments discussed above recognized throughout the company by year and the line item presentation in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations is as follows 
dollars in millions cost of goods sold and occupancy costs store and warehouse operating and selling expenses other asset impairments general and administrative expenses total the charges and impairments relate to the consolidation and elimination of functions in europe  the closure of stores in canada and company wide process improvement initiatives 
the charges and impairments recognized in include million for the abandonment of a software application  million for losses on the disposal of operating entities in israel and japan and other costs  as well as million of compensation related costs following the departure of our former ceo 
the million of charges recognized in 
table of contents followed a strategic review that led to closures of dcs in north america and europe  closures of stores in north america and japan  losses on sale leaseback transactions that were initiated to enhance our liquidity position  as well as headcount reductions and other restructuring activities 
as noted above  costs associated with that strategic review were captured and reviewed at the corporate level and were not included in division results  consistent with the internal reporting used to manage the business and allocate resources 
in addition to severance costs which usually require cash payment within days of the initial accounting expense recognition  a significant amount of the charges in related to closed store accruals  and to a lesser extent the store closures  which will continue to require cash payments over the related lease contract period or until the lease is terminated 
charges and credits associated with adjusting these accrued lease liabilities can impact future period results 
also  the ongoing accretion of the discounted accrued liability is reflected in operating expenses at the corporate level  but is not included in the charges and impairments discussed above 
the accretion charge for and totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
the following table indicates the amount of charges and impairments included in the determination of division operating profit and at the corporate level dollars in million north america retail division north america business solutions division international division corporate level total additional charges are anticipated in the international division during as activities are implemented and the accounting recognition criteria are met 
general and administrative expenses total general and administrative expenses g a increased to million in from million in the portion of g a expenses considered directly or closely related to division activity is included in the measurement of division operating profit 
other companies may charge more or less g a expenses and other costs to their segments  and our results therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
the remainder of the total g a expenses are considered corporate expenses 
a breakdown of g a is provided in the following table dollars in millions division g a corporate g a total g a of sales as noted above  total g a expenses include charges of million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
of these amounts  approximately million was included in division g a for  million in  and none in the remaining amounts in each year were included in corporate g a 
after considering these charges  corporate g a expenses increased in from higher variable based pay and the comparison to a favorable litigation settlement in the decrease in compared to was from lower variable based pay  lower legal fees and a favorable litigation settlement 
the company is in the process of further assessing the g a expenses charged to the divisions in determining their operating profit 
we currently cannot estimate when this analysis will be completed or the potential impacts 
table of contents on the divisions  but the portion of g a expenses allocated to the divisions in future years likely will be substantially increased 
other income and expense dollars in millions interest income interest expense miscellaneous income  net interest expense was impacted by the reversal of accrued interest of million in and million in following settlements of uncertain tax positions 
our accounting policy is to present interest accruals and reversals on uncertain tax positions as a component of interest expense 
additionally  approximately million of interest income was recognized in from one of the tax settlements 
our net miscellaneous income consists of our earnings of joint venture investments  gains and losses related to foreign exchange transactions  investment results from our deferred compensation plan and realized gains and impairments of other investments 
we recognized earnings from our joint venture in mexico  office depot de mexico  of approximately million  million and million in   and  respectively 
these results also were impacted by foreign currency and other gains and losses in all periods 
income taxes dollars in millions income tax expense benefit effective income tax rate income taxes as a percentage of earnings loss before income taxes 
the effective tax rates for and reflect benefits from settlements of uncertain tax positions utps and from reversal of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets 
the rate includes the reversal of million of utp accruals relating to us and foreign jurisdictions following closure of tax audits and the expiration of the statute of limitations on previously open tax years 
the effective rate includes the reversal of approximately million of utp accruals 
in addition  and include approximately million and million  respectively  of discrete benefits from the release of valuation allowances in certain european countries because of improved performance in those jurisdictions 
partially offsetting these tax benefits is income tax expense recognized for tax paying entities 
because of significant valuation allowances that remain in other jurisdictions  deferred tax benefits are not recognized on certain loss generating entities 
within our international operations  statutory tax expense is generally lower compared to the aggregate us federal and state income tax rates 
this is further impacted by favorable tax ruling within our international operations 
the aggregate reversal of utps in was reduced by approximately million which was offset against other tax related accounts and had no impact on earnings 
the utp reversals also resulted in a reversal of previously accrued interest expense of million in and million in  as well as recognition of million of interest income in our accounting policy is to include accrued interest on utps  and any related reversals  as a component of interest expense in the condensed consolidated statement of operations 
following the recognition of million of valuation allowances in  we have regularly experienced substantial volatility in our effective tax rate for interim periods 
because deferred income tax benefits cannot be recognized in several jurisdictions  changes in the amount  mix and timing of projected pre tax earnings in tax paying jurisdictions can have a significant impact on the annual expected tax rate which  applied against year to date results  can result in significant volatility in the overall effective tax rate 
this interim volatility is likely to continue in future periods until the valuation allowances can be released 

table of contents we file a us federal income tax return and other income tax returns in various states and foreign jurisdictions 
with few exceptions  we are no longer subject to active us federal  state or local income tax examinations for years before the us federal tax returns for  and are under review 
significant international tax jurisdictions include the uk  the netherlands  france and germany 
generally  we are subject to routine examination for years and forward in these foreign jurisdictions 
it is reasonably possible that some audits will close within the next twelve months which could result in a decrease of as much as million or an increase of as much as million to our accrued uncertain tax positions 
as part of the ongoing and audits  the us internal revenue service irs has proposed a deemed royalty assessment from our foreign operations with a tax and penalty amount of approximately million 
the company disagrees with this assessment and  based on the technical merits of this issue  believes that no accrual is required at this time 
the company is working with its outside tax advisors and the irs to resolve this dispute in a timely manner 
to the extent the irs were to prevail on this issue  the income statement and cash flow impact may be lowered because of available net operating losses and other deferred tax assets

see note f of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our deferred tax positions and accruals for uncertain tax positions and note h for a discussion of our employee benefit plans  including the pension plan and the deferred compensation plan 
in addition to the above  we have outstanding letters of credit totaling million at december  critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparation of these statements requires management to make judgments and estimates 
some accounting policies have a significant impact on amounts reported in these financial statements 
a summary of significant accounting policies can be found in note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have also identified certain accounting policies that we consider critical to understanding our business and our results of operations and we have provided below additional information on those policies 
vendor arrangements our inventory purchases from vendors are generally under arrangements that automatically renew until cancelled with periodic updates or annual negotiated agreements 
many of these arrangements require the vendors to make payments to us or provide credits to be used against purchases if and when certain conditions are met 
we generally refer to these arrangements as vendor programs  and they typically fall into two broad categories  with some underlying sub categories 
the first category is volume based 
table of contents rebates 
generally  our product costs per unit decline as higher volumes of purchases are reached 
certain of our vendor agreements provide that we pay higher per unit costs prior to reaching a predetermined tier  at which time the vendor rebates the per unit differential on past purchases  and also applies the lower cost to future purchases until the next milestone is reached 
current accounting rules provide that companies with a sound basis for estimating their full year purchases  and therefore the ultimate rebate level  can use that estimate to value inventory and cost of goods sold throughout the year 
we believe our history of purchases with many vendors provides us with a sound basis for our estimates of purchase volume 
if the anticipated volume of purchases is not reached  however  or if we form the belief at any given point in the year that it is not likely to be reached  cost of goods sold and the remaining inventory balances are adjusted to reflect that change in our outlook 
we review sales projections and related purchases against vendor program estimates at least quarterly and adjust these balances accordingly 
in recent years  the company has reduced the number of arrangements that contain this tiered purchase rebate mechanism in exchange for a lower product cost throughout the year 
continued elimination of tiered arrangements could further reduce the potential variability in gross margin from changes in volume based estimates 
the second broad category of arrangements with our vendors is event based programs 
these arrangements can take many forms  including advertising support  special pricing offered by certain of our vendors for a limited time  payments for special placement or promotion of a product  reimbursement of costs incurred to launch a vendor s product  and various other special programs 
these payments are classified as a reduction of costs of goods sold or inventory  as appropriate for the program 
some arrangements may meet the specific  incremental  identifiable cost criteria that allow for direct operating expense offset  but such arrangements are not significant 
vendor rebates are recognized throughout the year based on judgment and estimates and amounts due from vendors are generally settled throughout the year based on purchase volumes 
the final amounts due from vendors are generally known soon after year end 
substantially all vendor program receivables outstanding at the end of the year are settled within the three months immediately following year end 
we believe that our historic collection rates of these receivables provide a sound basis for our estimates of anticipated vendor payments throughout the year 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value 
we monitor active inventory for excessive quantities and slow moving items and record adjustments as necessary to lower the value if the anticipated realizable amount is below cost 
we also identify merchandise that we plan to discontinue or have begun to phase out and assess the estimated recoverability of the carrying value 
this includes consideration of the quantity of the merchandise  the rate of sale  and our assessment of current and projected market conditions and anticipated vendor rebates 
if necessary  we record a charge to cost of sales to reduce the carrying value of this merchandise to our estimate of the lower of cost or realizable amount 
additional promotional activities may be initiated and markdowns may be taken as considered appropriate until the product is sold or otherwise disposed 
estimates and judgments are required in determining what items to stock and at what level  and what items to discontinue and how to value them prior to sale 
we also recognize an expense in cost of sales for our estimate of physical inventory loss from theft  short shipment and other factors referred to as inventory shrink 
during the year  we adjust the estimate of our shrink rate accrual following on hand adjustments and our physical inventory results 
these changes in estimates may result in volatility within the year or impact comparisons to other periods 
closed store accruals and asset impairments we regularly assess the performance of each retail store against historic patterns and projections of future profitability 
these assessments are based on management s estimates for sales levels  gross margin attainments  and cash flow generation 
if  as a result of these evaluations  management determines that a store will not achieve certain operating performance targets  we may decide to close the store 
at the point of closure  we recognize a liability for the remaining costs related to the property  reduced by an estimate of any sublease income 
the calculation of this liability requires us to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding the remaining term of the lease including vacancy period  anticipated sublease 
table of contents income  and costs associated with vacating the premises 
lease commitments with no economic benefit to the company are discounted at the credit adjusted discount rate at the time of each location closure 
with assistance from independent third parties to assess market conditions  we periodically review these judgments and estimates and adjust the liability accordingly 
future fluctuations in the economy and the market demand for commercial properties could result in material changes in this liability 
costs associated with facility closures are included in store and warehouse operating and selling expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
the accretion of the discounted lease liability and potential future positive and negative adjustments to the recorded amounts from settlements or changes in market conditions related to a company wide business review are recognized at the corporate level  outside of the determination of division operating profit 
residual costs and benefits of closures from other periods are included in division operating profit 
in addition to the decision about whether or not to close a store  store assets are regularly reviewed for recoverability of their carrying amounts 
the recoverability assessment requires judgment and estimates of a store s future cash flows 
our impairment analysis builds a cash flow model at the individual store level  beginning with recent store performance and trending the anticipated future results based on chain wide and individual store initiatives 
if the anticipated undiscounted cash flows of a store cannot support the carrying amount of the store s assets  an impairment charge is recorded to operations as a component of store and warehouse operating and selling expenses 
that charge is measured as the difference between the carrying value of the assets and their estimated fair value  typically calculated as the discounted amount of the estimated cash flow 
the store level estimated cash flows  by their nature  include uncertain projections and assumptions about future performance 
important assumptions used in these projections include an assessment of future overall economic conditions  the company s ability to control future costs  maintain aspects of positive performance  and successfully implement initiatives designed to enhance sales and gross margins 
to the extent that management s estimates of future performance are not realized  future assessments could result in material impairment charges 
goodwill and other intangible assets at december   we had goodwill of million  indefinite lived intangible assets of million and definite lived intangible assets of million 
we review amortization periods and goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of the year  or sooner if indicators of potential impairment are identified 
we use a discounted cash flow approach in assessing the estimated fair value of the reporting units with goodwill and a relief from royalty approach for the indefinite lived trade name 
the discounted cash flow analysis begins with the ensuing year s business plan and requires estimates of future sales  profitability  capital expenditures and related cash flows 
we include a residual value and discount the aggregate cash flow at an estimated cost of capital for the related unit 
we also review the results against a measurement of market capitalization and  to the extent available  market data 
these calculations require significant judgment 
of the goodwill recognized at december   approximately million was in the international division s european reporting unit and million was in the north american business solutions division s direct reporting unit 
the european reporting unit has the greatest sensitivity to potential changes in economic conditions  company performance and the related impacts on estimated fair value 
should future performance be below our projections  goodwill and other intangible asset impairment changes could result 
while the quantitative assessment described above was used for our assessment  the accounting rules for goodwill testing will change in to allow for a qualitative assessment of potential impairment if certain conditions are met or the continued use of this quantitative approach 
income taxes income tax accounting requires management to make estimates and apply judgments to events that will be recognized in one period under rules that apply to financial reporting and in a different period in our tax returns 
in particular  judgment is required when estimating the value of future tax deductions  tax credits  and the realizability of net operating loss carryforwards nols  as represented by deferred tax assets 
when we believe the realization of all or a portion of a deferred tax asset is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
changes in judgments that increase or decrease these valuation allowances impact current earnings 
because of the downturn in our performance during this recessionary period  as well as the significant restructuring activities and charges we have taken in response  we established valuation allowances totaling 
table of contents approximately million during the charge to establish the valuation allowance followed the third quarter condition of reaching or nearly reaching a month cumulative loss position in two taxing jurisdictions 
judgment is required in projecting when operations will be sufficiently positive to allow a conclusion that utilization of the deferred tax assets will once again be more likely than not 
positive performance in subsequent periods and projections of future positive performance will need to be evaluated against existing negative evidence 
valuation allowances in certain foreign jurisdictions were removed during and because sufficient positive financial information existed  resulting in tax benefit recognition of million and million  respectively 
our effective tax rate in future periods may be positively or negatively impacted by changes in related judgments about valuation allowances or pre tax operations 
at december   approximately million of valuation allowances remain relating to us businesses and approximately million relating to foreign jurisdictions 
in addition to judgments associated with valuation accounts  our current tax provision can be affected by our mix of income and identification or resolution of uncertain tax positions 
because income from domestic and international sources may be taxed at different rates  the shift in mix during a year or over years can cause the effective tax rate to change 
we base our rate during the year on our best estimate of an annual effective rate  and update that estimate quarterly  with the cumulative effect of a change in the anticipated annual rate reflected in the tax provision of that period 
such changes can result in significant interim reporting volatility  as was experienced during and this volatility can result from changes in our projected earnings levels  the mix of income  the impact of valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions and the interim accounting rules applied to entities expected to pay taxes on a full year basis  but recognizing losses in an interim period 
we file our tax returns based on our best understanding of the appropriate tax rules and regulations 
however  complexities in the rules and our operations  as well as positions taken publicly by the taxing authorities  may lead us to conclude that an accrual for an uncertain tax position utp is required 
we generally maintain accruals for utps until examination of the tax position is completed by the taxing authority  available review periods expire  or additional facts and circumstances cause us to change our assessment of the appropriate accrual amount 
during the third quarter of  following closure of certain tax audits and the expiration of the statute of limitations on previously open tax years  we reversed approximately million of utps and a related million of accrued interest 
an additional utp accrual of million was reversed during the fourth quarter of following closure of certain tax audits 
at december   the utp accrual was approximately million 
matters could arise in the future that could result in additional tax and interest expense or utp accruals 
for example  the company has received notice from the irs of a proposed deemed royalty assessment from our foreign operations 
we disagree with this assessment and no accrual for this matter has been recorded 
see note f to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
further  the company has significant operations outside the us because earnings from those entities have been and will continue to be reinvested into the foreign operations  no incremental us income taxes have been accrued on those earnings 
should the company decide to distribute earnings from our foreign operations to the us  additional income tax expense would be recognized  or valuation allowances reduced  for the income tax consequence of the anticipated distribution and possibly for the calculated tax consequences of the full amount of undistributed earnings  net of allowable offsets 
the company does not intend to repatriate these funds to the us preferred stock paid in kind dividends our redeemable preferred stock carries a stated dividend of  subject to future decreases in certain circumstances  and allows for payment in cash or an increase in the preferred stock s liquidation preference as directed by the board of directors 
the valuation for accounting purposes of the dividend paid in kind requires significant judgment to determine the estimated fair value 
the company has used a binomial simulation model to measure values of multiple possible outcomes of the various provisions in the agreement that could impact whether the dividend rate would change based on future stock price performance  whether the company would issue a notice to call the preferred shares and whether the holders would convert their preferred stock into common stock 
while the fair value of preferred stock dividends paid in kind has no standing in the contractual rights to liquidation preference of the preferred shareholders nor any 
table of contents cash impact on the company  it impacts the measurement of net income available to common shareholders and earnings per share 
changes in the valuation assumptions such as the risk adjusted rate  stock price volatility and time to call or convert can impact the estimated fair value and therefore the amount reported as net income available to common shareholders and earnings per share 
however  the valuation is most sensitive to changes in the underlying common stock price 
the company believes the model used to estimate fair value is reasonable and appropriate  but the reported dividend amount could change significantly in future periods based on changes in the underlying common stock price and the model inputs 
after having paid the dividend in cash for several quarters  the board of directors decided to pay the dividend in kind for the amount due in january in kind dividends may continue at least throughout  though the board of directors assesses available data quarterly before making that decision 
significant trends  developments and uncertainties competitive factors over the years  we have seen continued development and growth of competitors in all segments of our business 
in particular  mass merchandisers and warehouse clubs  as well as grocery and drugstore chains  have increased their assortment of home office merchandise  attracting additional back to school customers and year round casual shoppers 
warehouse clubs have expanded beyond their in store assortment by adding catalogs and web sites from which a much broader assortment of products may be ordered 
we also face competition from other office supply stores that compete directly with us in numerous markets 
this competition is likely to result in increased competitive pressures on pricing  product selection and services provided 
many of these retail competitors  including discounters  warehouse clubs  and drug stores and grocery chains  carry basic office supply products 
some of them also feature technology products 
many of them may price certain of these offerings lower than we do  but they have not shown an indication of greatly expanding their somewhat limited product offerings at this time 
this trend towards a proliferation of retailers offering a limited assortment of office products is a potentially serious trend in our industry that could shift purchasing away from office supply specialty retailers and adversely impact our results 
we have also seen growth in competitors that offer office products over the internet  featuring special purchase incentives and one time deals such as close outs 
through our own successful internet and business to business web sites  we believe that we have positioned ourselves competitively in the e commerce arena 
another trend in our industry has been consolidation  as competitors in office supply stores and the copy print channel have been acquired and consolidated into larger  well capitalized corporations 
this trend towards consolidation  coupled with acquisitions by financially strong organizations  is potentially a significant trend in our industry that could impact our results 
we regularly consider these and other competitive factors when we establish both offensive and defensive aspects of our overall business strategy and operating plans 
economic factors our customers in the north american retail division and the international division and many of our customers in the north american business solutions division are predominantly small and home office businesses 
accordingly  these customers may continue to curtail their spending in reaction to macroeconomic conditions  such as changes in the housing market and commodity costs  credit availability and other factors 
the downturn in the global economy experienced in recent years negatively impacted our sales and profits 
liquidity factors historically  we have generated positive cash flow from operating activities and have had access to broad financial markets that provide the liquidity we need to operate our business 
together  these sources have been used to fund operating and working capital needs  as well as invest in business expansion through new store openings  capital improvements and acquisitions 
due to the downturn in the global economy  our operating results have declined 
we have in place an asset based credit facility to provide liquidity  subject to availability as specified in the agreement 
further deterioration in our financial results could negatively impact 
table of contents our credit ratings  our liquidity and our access to the capital markets 
certain of our existing indebtedness matures in and there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance all or a portion of that indebtedness 
if we are able to refinance all or a portion of that indebtedness  the terms of such refinancing will likely be less favorable than the terms of our existing indebtedness 
market sensitive risks and positions the company has adopted an enterprise risk management process patterned after the principles set out by the committee of sponsoring organizations coso in management utilizes a common view of exposure identification and risk management 
a process is in place for periodic risk reviews and identification of appropriate mitigation strategies 
we have market risk exposure related to interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and commodities 
market risk is measured as the potential negative impact on earnings  cash flows or fair values resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates over the next year 
interest rate changes on obligations may result from external market factors  as well as changes in our credit rating 
we manage our exposure to market risks at the corporate level 
the portfolio of interest sensitive assets and liabilities is monitored to provide liquidity necessary to satisfy anticipated short term needs 
our risk management policies allow the use of specified financial instruments for hedging purposes only  speculation on interest rates  foreign currency rates  or commodities is not permitted 
interest rate risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes on cash  cash equivalents and debt obligations 
the impact on cash and short term investments held at the end of from a hypothetical decrease in interest rates would be a decrease in interest income of less than million 
market risk associated with our debt portfolio is summarized below dollars in thousands carrying value fair value risk sensitivity carrying value fair value risk sensitivity million senior notes asset based credit facility the risk sensitivity of fixed rate debt reflects the estimated increase in fair value from a basis point decrease in interest rates  calculated on a discounted cash flow basis 
the sensitivity of variable rate debt reflects the possible increase in interest expense during the next period from a basis point change in interest rates prevailing at year end 
foreign exchange rate risk we conduct business through entities in various countries outside the united states where their functional currency is not the us dollar 
while our company sells directly or indirectly to customers in countries  the principal operations of our international division are in countries with euro  british pound and mexican peso functional currencies 
we continue to assess our exposure to foreign currency fluctuation against the us dollar 
as of december   a change in the applicable foreign exchange rates would result in an increase or decrease in our pretax earnings of approximately million 
although operations generally are conducted in the relevant local currency  we also are subject to foreign exchange transaction exposure when our subsidiaries transact business in a currency other than their own functional currency 
this exposure arises primarily from inventory purchases in a foreign currency 
at 
table of contents december   there were no foreign exchange forward contracts hedging inventory exposures 
this amount was million at its highest point during also  from time to time  we enter into foreign exchange forward transactions to protect against possible changes in exchange rates related to scheduled or anticipated cash movements among our operating entities 
generally  we evaluate the performance of our international businesses by focusing on the local currency results of the business  and not with regard to the translation into us dollars  as the latter is impacted by external factors 
commodities risk we operate a large network of stores and delivery centers around the world 
as such  we purchase significant amounts of fuel needed to transport products to our stores and customers as well as pay shipping costs to import products from overseas 
we are exposed to potential changes in the underlying commodity costs associated with this transport activity 
as of december   a change in domestic commodity costs would result in an increase or decrease in our operating profit of approximately million 
inflation and seasonality although we cannot determine the precise effects of inflation on our business  we do not believe inflation has had a material impact on our sales or the results of our operations 
we consider our business to be only somewhat seasonal  with sales generally trending lower in the second quarter  following the back to business sales cycle in the first quarter and preceding the back to school sales cycle in the third quarter and the holiday sales cycle in the fourth quarter 
certain working capital components may build and recede during the year reflecting established selling cycles 
business cycles can and have impacted our operations and financial position when compared to other periods 
new accounting standards effective for the first quarter of  a new accounting standard will require the presentation of net income and other comprehensive income either as a continuous statement or as two separate statements 
the portion of the new standard which would require the presentation of reclassifications of other comprehensive income on the face of the income statement has been deferred 
in past periods  we have presented the components of other comprehensive income as a separate statement for the full year and as a separate footnote for interim periods 
we anticipate following the two statement format 
the standard will not change the recognition or measurement of net income or other comprehensive income 
also effective for the first quarter of  a new accounting standard has been issued that is intended to achieve common fair value measurements and disclosure requirements between us generally accepted accounting principles and international financial reporting standards 
this new standard amends current fair value guidance to include increased transparency around valuation inputs and investment categorization 
effective for testing for goodwill impairment  entities will have an option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of their reporting units 
if  based on the qualitative assessment  an entity concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  quantitative testing for impairment is not necessary 
the company did not elect the early adoption that was available for additionally  effective for the first quarter of  a new accounting standard will require disclosure of information about the effect or potential effect of financial instrument netting arrangements on the company s financial position 
companies will be required to present both net offset amounts and gross information in the notes to the financial statements for relevant assets and liabilities that are offset 

table of contents including the above  there are no recently issued accounting standards that are expected to have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
however  the financial accounting standards board has issued proposed accounting rules relating to leasing transactions that  if passed in their current form  would have significant impacts to our financial statements 
among other things  the current proposal would create a right of use asset and corresponding liability on the balance sheet measured at the present value of minimum lease payments  record amortization of the right of use asset and implied interest of the liability on the statement of operations and characterize a portion of the lease payments as financing activities rather than operating activities on the statement of cash flow 
these proposed changes in accounting rules would have no direct economic impact to the company
