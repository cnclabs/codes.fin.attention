we are not a certified public accounting firm and do not provide audit  attest  or public accounting services 
our business is organized in four reporting segments business consulting services  dispute and investigative services  economic consulting  and international consulting which are discussed in further detail below 
we are a delaware corporation incorporated in and headquartered in chicago  illinois 
our executive office is located at south wacker drive  suite  chicago  illinois our telephone number is our common stock is traded on the new york stock exchange under the symbol nci 
general development of the business since our inception  we have grown through the recruitment of new consultants combined with acquisition investments of select firms that are complementary to our business 
we completed a strategic review during and based on the results of that review we have been focused on managing our resources and concentrating on fewer practice areas that have growth potential and where we believe we enjoy scale and competitive advantages 
our growth strategy has been focused on the following areas healthcare  energy  disputes and economics  which now comprise approximately of our revenues 
over the past four years we have invested approximately million primarily in these four areas 
over the same period we have reduced our debt from million to million 
in  we acquired chicago partners which formed the basis of our economic consulting segment and in early we acquired empiris to expand this segment to the washington  dc market  providing us with growth opportunities in the government and regulatory arena 
in late  we acquired summit blue to bolster our presence within the energy market  specifically energy efficiency  demand side management  smart grid and renewable energy strategies 
in  we expanded our healthcare consulting capabilities with the acquisition of ethospartners and grew our disputes and investigative services business specifically within the anti money laundering and foreign corrupt practices act areas with the acquisition of daylight forensics 
in  we acquired ignited solutions which expanded our technology advisory solutions services  including electronic discovery data collection  data processing and data hosting within our dispute and investigative services segment 
we also acquired several smaller businesses to further complement our existing services within these practice areas 
in addition to our acquisitions we continue to strengthen our team of recognized experts and thought leaders across various industries 
in recent years we have hired over senior level consultants 
in addition to the growth discussed above  we continue to operate other businesses that complement our focus areas 

table of contents see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations acquisitions for further discussion of acquisitions made during the past three years 
human capital resources at december   we had  employees 
after adjusting total employees for part time status we had  full time equivalent fte employees 
these fte employees were comprised of the following  consultants who are assigned to client service and record time to client engagements 
technology consultants who are assigned to client service and provide technology services but do not record time to specific client engagements 
project employees who perform client services on a contractual basis 
non billable employees who are assigned to administrative and support functions  including office services  corporate functions  and certain practice support functions 
the costs directly relating to practice support functions are recorded as costs of services before reimbursements 
our revenues are primarily generated from services performed by our consultants  therefore  our success depends in large part on attracting  retaining and motivating talented  creative and experienced consultants at all levels and across geographies 
we have acquired and seek to acquire these individuals through both recruitment and acquisitions of businesses 
in connection with recruiting  we employ internal recruiters  retain executive search firms  and utilize personal and business contacts 
our consultants are drawn from the industries we serve  from accounting and other consulting organizations  and from top rated colleges and universities 
our consultants include but are not limited to phds  mds  mbas  jds  cpas  cras certified risk analysts  certified fraud examiners  asas accredited senior appraisers  engineers  nurses and former government officials 
in addition to recruiting consultants  we have acquired and seek to acquire certain consulting businesses to add highly skilled consultants  to enhance our service offerings and to expand our geographical footprint 
we believe that the strategy of selectively acquiring consulting businesses and hiring additional consulting capabilities strengthens our platform  market share and overall operating results 
we retain our employees by offering competitive compensation packages of base and incentive compensation  and in certain instances share based compensation and retention incentives  attractive benefits and rewarding careers 
we continually review and adjust  if needed  our consultants total compensation including salaries  annual cash incentive compensation  other cash and equity incentives  and benefits to ensure that it is competitive within the industry and is consistent with our performance 
in addition to compensation  we promote numerous charitable  philanthropic  and social awareness programs that not only support our community  but also provide rewarding experiences for our employees outside of their client activities 
we regularly evaluate consultant resource levels and utilization against future demand expectations and historical trends 
from time to time  we may reduce or add resources in certain areas in an effort to align with changing demands 
in connection with these changing demands  we also utilize project employees and engage independent contractors to supplement our full time consultants on certain engagements 
we find that retaining independent contractors on a per engagement basis from time to time allows us to quickly adjust staffing in response to changes in demand for our services without incurring up front recruiting costs of increasing our full time employee base 
in connection with recruiting activities and business acquisitions  our general policy is to obtain non solicitation covenants from senior and some mid level consultants 
most of these covenants have restrictions that extend months or more beyond the termination of employment 
we utilize these contractual agreements and other agreements to reduce the risk of attrition and to provide stability to our existing clients  staff and projects 
our bill rates or fees charged to clients are tiered in accordance with the experience and levels of our consultants 
we monitor and adjust those bill rates or fees according to then current market conditions for our service offerings and within the various industries we serve 

table of contents industry sectors we provide services to and focus on industries undergoing substantial regulatory or structural change 
our service offerings are relevant to most industries including the public sector 
however  we have significant industry specific knowledge and a large client base in the legal  energy  healthcare and financial services industries 
competition the market for consulting services is highly competitive  highly fragmented and subject to rapid change 
the market includes a large number of participants with a variety of skills and industry expertise  including general management and information technology consulting firms  as well as global accounting firms  and other local  regional  national and international consulting firms 
many of these companies are international in scope and have larger teams of personnel  financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
in particular the big four accounting firms  pwc  deloitte  ernst young and kpmg  are highly competitive in the consulting industry 
however  we believe that our experience  reputation  industry focus and broad range of service offerings enable us to compete effectively in the consulting marketplace 
developing client relationships we market our services directly to corporate counsel  law firms  governmental agencies  corporate boards  corporate executives and special committees 
we use a variety of business development and marketing channels to communicate directly with current and prospective clients  including on site presentations  industry seminars  and industry specific articles 
we have recently strengthened our market presence by developing our brand name 
new engagements are sought and won by our senior and mid level consultants working together with our business development team that supports all of our business segments 
we seek to leverage our client relationships in one business segment to cross sell service offerings provided by the other business segments 
clients frequently expand the scope of engagements during delivery to include follow on  complementary services 
our future performance will continue to depend upon our ability to win new engagements  retain consultants  develop and continue client relationships and maintain our reputation 
we believe our unique mix of deep industry expertise  combined with our scale  broad geographic presence  multi disciplinary professionals and targeted service offerings  position us to serve the majority of our clients challenges 
we continue to establish programs to facilitate collaborative product development and marketing efforts  and also to develop new  innovative and repeatable solutions for our clients 
financial information about business segments our business is organized in four reporting segments business consulting services  dispute and investigative services  economic consulting  and international consulting 
these reporting segments are generally defined by the nature of their services and geography and may be the aggregation of multiple operating segments as indicated in the description below 
during the first quarter of  certain organizational changes were made which  along with other factors  resulted in the identification of two additional operating segments within the business consulting services segment and the repositioning of certain service offerings between the segments 
we have three operating segments within the business consulting services segment energy  healthcare and other business consulting services 
our business is managed and resources are allocated on the basis of the six operating segments 
prior year comparative segment data has been restated to be consistent with the current presentation 
the business consulting services reporting segment provides strategic  operational  financial  regulatory and technical management consulting services to clients  principally c suite executives and corporate management  government agencies and law firms 
the reporting segment is comprised of three operating segments energy  healthcare  and other business consulting services 
energy and healthcare are defined as operating segments due to their size  importance and organizational reporting relationships

our other business consulting operating segment provides operations advisory  valuation and restructuring services to the financial services and other industries 
the dispute and investigative services reporting segment provides a wide range of services to clients facing the challenges of disputes  litigation  forensic investigation  discovery and regulatory compliance 
the clients of this segment are principally law firms  corporate general counsels  corporate boards and government agencies

segment revenues before reimbursements  segment total revenues and segment operating profit together with a reconciliation to income before income tax expense for the last three years are included in note segment information to the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
certain unallocated expense amounts related to specific reporting segments have been excluded from the calculation of segment operating profit to be consistent with the information used by management to evaluate segment performance 
segment operating profit represents total revenues less cost of services excluding long term compensation expense attributable to consultants 
the information presented does not necessarily reflect the results of segment operations that would have occurred had the segments been stand alone businesses 
long term compensation expense related to consultants includes share based compensation expense and compensation expense attributed to retention incentives see note supplemental consolidated balance sheet information to the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
revenues attributable to each segment as a percentage of total company revenues were as follows for the year ended december  business consulting services dispute and investigative services economic consulting international consulting segment operating profit attributable to each segment as a percentage of total company segment operating profit was as follows for the year ended december  business consulting services dispute and investigative services economic consulting international consulting

the remaining assets are unallocated 
allocated assets by segment were as follows shown in thousands december  business consulting services dispute and investigative services economic consulting international consulting unallocated assets total assets how our income is derived we derive our revenues from fees and reimbursable expenses for professional services 
a majority of our revenues are generated under hourly or daily rates billed on a time and materials basis 
clients are typically invoiced on a monthly basis  with revenues recognized as the services are provided 
there are also client engagements in which we are paid a fixed amount for our services  often referred to as fixed fee billings  the vast majority of our healthcare operating segment utilizes fixed fee billing arrangements 
this may be one single amount covering the whole engagement or several amounts for various phases or functions of the engagement 
from time to time  we earn incremental revenues  in addition to hourly or fixed fee billings  which are contingent on the attainment of certain contractual milestones or objectives 
we also recognize revenues from business referral fees or commissions on certain contractual outcomes 
these performance based and referral revenues may cause unusual variations in our quarterly revenues and results of operations 
our most significant expense is labor costs  which consists of consultant salaries  incentive compensation  amortization of sign on and retention incentive payments  share based compensation and benefits 
labor costs are reported in cost of services before reimbursable expenses  which also includes sales and marketing expenses and the direct costs of recruiting and training consultants 
our most significant overhead expenses are administrative compensation and benefits and office related expenses 
administrative compensation includes salaries  incentive compensation  share based compensation and benefits for corporate management and administrative personnel  that indirectly support client engagements 
office related expenses primarily consist of rent for our offices 
other overhead costs include bad debt expense  marketing  technology  finance and human capital management 
concentration of revenues revenues earned from our top clients amounted to  and of our total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase over the past two years related primarily to larger credit crisis related jobs in our dispute and investigative services segment 
revenues earned from our top 
table of contents clients amounted to  and of our total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
no single client accounted for more than of our total revenues for any of the years ended december   and the mix of our largest clients may change from year to year 
some of our top clients  such as certain law firms  retain our services on behalf of their clients and those clients may change from year to year 
non us operations we have offices in the united kingdom  canada  hong kong  and dubai 
in addition  we have clients based in the united states that have international operations 
the united kingdom accounted for of our total revenues for the years ended december  and and of our total revenue for the year ended december  no country  other than the united states and the united kingdom  accounted for more than of our total revenues in any of the three years ended december   and our non us subsidiaries  in the aggregate  represented approximately  or million  of our total revenues in compared to  or million  in and  or million  in available information we maintain a corporate website at www

item a 
risk factors 
in addition to other information contained in this report and in the documents incorporated by reference herein  the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating us and our business 
these factors could have a significant impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by disruptions in the marketplace caused by economic and political conditions 
global economic and political conditions affect our clients businesses and the markets they serve 
a severe and or prolonged economic downturn or a negative or uncertain political climate could adversely affect our clients financial condition and the levels and types of business activity engaged in by our clients and the industries we serve 
clients could determine that discretionary projects are no longer viable or that new projects are not advisable 
this may reduce demand for our services  depress pricing for our services or render certain of our services obsolete  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
changes in global economic conditions or the regulatory or legislative landscape could also shift demand to services that we do not offer or for which we do not have competitive advantages  and this could negatively affect the amount of new business that we are able to obtain 
although we have implemented ongoing cost management measures  if we are unable to appropriately manage costs or if we are unable to successfully anticipate changing economic and political conditions  we may be unable to effectively plan for and respond to those changes  and our business could be adversely affected 
additionally  significant economic turmoil or financial market disruptions could also adversely impact the availability of financing to our clients and therefore may adversely impact our ability to collect amounts due from our clients or cause them to terminate their contracts with us  each of which could adversely affect our results of operations 

table of contents we cannot be assured that we will have access to sufficient sources of capital to meet our working capital needs or the future needs of our business 
in may  we entered into a new unsecured credit agreement with a syndicate of banks 
the credit agreement provides us a five year million revolving credit facility  which may be increased to million at our option  subject to the terms and conditions specified in the credit agreement 
we use the credit facility to assist in funding our short term working capital and long term cash requirements 
at december   we had million in borrowings outstanding under the credit facility 
there can be no assurance that the credit facility will continue to be sufficient to meet the future needs of our business  particularly if a decline in our financial performance occurs 
if this occurs  and we are unable to otherwise increase our operating cash flows or raise additional capital or obtain other debt financing  we may be unable to meet our future working capital needs or  for example  consummate future acquisitions 
furthermore  if our clients financial condition were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments to us  our financial position and operating cash flows would be adversely impacted 
lastly  certain financial institutions that are lenders under our credit facility could be adversely impacted by a depressed economy and therefore unable to meet their commitments under our credit facility  which in turn would reduce the amounts available to us under that facility 
our failure to comply with the covenants in our credit agreement could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity 
our credit agreement contains financial covenants requiring  among other things  certain levels of interest and debt coverage 
poor financial performance could cause us to be in default of these covenants 
while we were in compliance with these covenants at december   there can be no assurance that we will remain in compliance in the future 
our borrowings under our credit facility tend to be higher during the first half of the year to fund annual incentive payments  and as a result  our consolidated leverage ratio is expected to increase from december  levels 
if we fail to comply with the covenants in our credit agreement  this could result in our having to seek an amendment or waiver from our lenders to avoid the termination of their commitments and or the acceleration of the maturity of outstanding amounts under the credit facility 
the cost of our obtaining an amendment or waiver could be significant  and further  there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain an amendment or waiver 
if our lenders were unwilling to enter into an amendment or provide a waiver  all amounts outstanding under our credit facility would become immediately due and payable 
we have variable rate indebtedness which subjects us to interest rate risk and may cause our annual debt service obligations to increase significantly 
borrowings under our credit facility are at variable rates of interest which expose us to interest rate risk 
if interest rates increase  our debt service obligations would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same  and in turn  our net income would decrease 
our business could be impacted by competition and regulatory and legislative changes 
the market for consulting services is highly competitive  highly fragmented  and subject to rapid change 
the market includes a large number of participants with a variety of skills and industry expertise  including general management and information technology consulting firms  as well as the global accounting firms and other local  regional  national  and international consulting firms 
many of these firms are international in scope and have larger teams of personnel  financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
some firms may have lower overhead and other costs and  therefore  may be able to more effectively compete through lower cost service offerings 
many of our clients operate in highly regulated industries such as healthcare  energy  financial services and insurance 
regulatory and legislative changes in these industries potentially render certain of our service offerings obsolete and decrease our competitive position 
if we cannot compete effectively  our revenues and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

table of contents our inability to successfully recruit and retain senior level consultants will affect our ability to win new engagements and compete effectively 
we rely heavily on a group of senior level consultants  and we believe our future success is dependent on our ability to retain their services 
competition for skilled consultants is intense  and compensation and retention related issues are a continuing challenge 
the consulting industry has low barriers to entry making it easy for consultants to start their own business or work independently 
in addition  it is relatively easy for consultants to change employers 
further  limitations on available shares under our equity compensation plans or a sustained decline in our stock price could also impair our ability to offer share based compensation as incentives to our senior level consultants 
our inability to attract  retain and motivate our senior level consultants  as well as corporate management  could have an adverse effect on our ability to win new client engagements or meet client needs in our current engagements  and our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected 
further  our failure to realize the expected financial returns from our recruiting investments could adversely impact our results of operations 
our revenues and profitability may suffer if we are not able to maintain current bill rates and or utilization rates 
our revenues  and in turn our profitability  are largely based on the bill rates charged to clients and the number of hours our consultants work on client engagements  which we define as the utilization of our consultants 
accordingly  if we are not able to maintain the bill rates for our services or appropriate utilization rates for our consultants  our revenues  profit margins and profitability may suffer 
bill rates and consultant utilization rates are affected by a number of factors  including our ability to predict future demand for our services and maintain the appropriate staffing levels without significant underutilized consulting personnel  our ability to transition consultants from completed projects to new client engagements  our clients perceptions of our ability to add value through our services  our competitors pricing of services  the market demand for our services  our ability to manage our human capital resources  our ability to manage significantly larger and more diverse workforces as we increase the number of our consultants and execute our growth strategies  and the economic  political and regulatory environment as noted above 
additionally  the profitability of our fixed fee client engagements may not meet our expectations if we underestimate the cost of these engagements 
our inability to attract business from new or existing clients could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
many of our client engagement agreements are short term in nature less than one year and can be terminated by our clients with little or no notice and without penalty 
for example  in our litigation related engagements  if the litigation is settled  our services usually are no longer necessary and our engagement is promptly terminated 
some of our services involve multiple engagements or stages 
in those engagements  there is a risk that a client may choose not to retain us for the additional stages of an engagement or that a client will cancel or delay additional planned engagements 
our client engagements are usually relatively short term in comparison to our office related expenses and other infrastructure commitments 

table of contents in the past  we have derived significant revenues from events as inherently unpredictable as the california energy crisis  the sarbanes oxley act of  healthcare reform  the credit crisis and significant natural disasters including major hurricanes and earthquakes 
those events  in addition to being unpredictable  often have impacts that decline over time as clients adjust to and compensate for the challenges they face 
these factors also limit our ability to predict future revenues and make corresponding adjustments to our consulting staffing levels  which in turn could adversely impact our results of operations 
unsuccessful client engagements could result in damage to our professional reputation or legal liability which could have a material adverse effect on us 
our professional reputation and that of our consultants is critical to our ability to successfully compete for new client engagements and attract and retain employees 
any factors that damage our professional reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  our client engagements subject us to the risk of legal liability 
any public assertion or litigation alleging that our services were deficient or that we breached any of our obligations to a client could expose us to significant legal liabilities  distract our management and damage our reputation 
our professional insurance may not cover every type of claim or liability that could potentially arise from our client engagements 
in addition  the limits of our insurance coverage may not be enough to cover a particular claim or a group of claims and the costs of defense 
some of the work we do involves greater risk than ordinary consulting engagements 
we do work for clients that for financial  legal or other reasons may present higher than normal risks 
while we attempt to identify and mitigate our exposure with respect to higher risk engagements and higher risk clients  these efforts may be ineffective and an actual or alleged error or omission on our part or the part of our client or other third parties in one or more of these higher risk engagements could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition 
examples of higher risk engagements include  but are not limited to interim management engagements  including those for hospitals and other healthcare providers  engagements where we assist clients in complying with healthcare related regulatory requirements  including clinical documentation improvement training and auditing services  revenue cycle and operational performance improvement services  billing services  medical record coding and auditing services  strategic consulting for hospital and health system merger and affiliation  and independent review organization assignments corporate restructuring engagements  both inside and outside bankruptcy proceedings  engagements where we deliver a fairness opinion  engagements where we deliver project management services for large construction projects  engagements where we receive or process sensitive data  including personal consumer or private health information  engagements where we deliver a compliance effectiveness opinion  and engagements involving independent consultants reports in support of financings 
we encounter professional conflicts of interest 
if we are unable to accept new engagements for any reason  including business and legal conflicts  our consultants may become underutilized or discontented  which may adversely affect our future revenues and results of operations  as well as our ability to retain these consultants 
in addition  although we have systems and procedures to identify potential conflicts of interest prior to accepting a new engagement  there is no guarantee that all potential conflicts of interest will be identified and undetected conflicts may result in damage to our reputation and result in professional liability which may adversely impact our business and results of operations 

table of contents our international operations create special risks 
we have offices in the united kingdom  canada  hong kong  dubai and other cities outside of the us and conduct business in several other countries 
we expect to continue to expand globally and our international revenues may account for an increasing portion of our revenues in the future 
our international operations carry special financial  business and legal risks  including cultural and language differences  employment laws and related factors that could result in lower utilization  higher staffing costs  and cyclical fluctuations of utilization and revenues  currency fluctuations that adversely affect our financial position and operating results  differing regulatory requirements and other barriers to conducting business  impact on consulting spend from international firms and global economies impacted by the european sovereign debt crisis and related government and economic response managing the risks associated with engagements performed by employees and independent contractors with foreign officials and governmental agencies  including the risks arising from the foreign corrupt practices act  greater difficulties in managing and staffing foreign operations  including in high risk geographies  successful entry and execution in new markets  restrictions on the repatriation of earnings  and potentially adverse tax consequences  such as net operating loss carry forwards that cannot be realized 
if we are not able to successfully mitigate the special risks associated with our international operations  our business prospects and results of operations could be negatively impacted 
our work with governmental clients has inherent risks related to the governmental contracting process 
we work for various united states  state  local  and foreign governmental entities and agencies 
these projects have special risks that include  but are not limited to  the following governmental agencies generally reserve the right to audit our contract costs  including allocated indirect costs  and conduct inquiries and investigations of our business practices with respect to governmental contracts 
if the governmental entity finds that the costs are not reimbursable  then we will not be allowed to bill for them or the cost must be refunded to the governmental entity if it has already been paid to us 
findings from an audit also may result in our being required to prospectively adjust previously agreed rates for work which would affect our future profit margins 
if a governmental client discovers improper or illegal activities in the course of its audits or investigations  we may become subject to various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  which may include termination of contracts  forfeiture of profits  suspension of payments  fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with other agencies of that government 
governmental contracts  and the proceedings surrounding them  are often subject to more extensive scrutiny and publicity than other commercial contracts 
negative publicity related to our governmental contracts  regardless of whether it is accurate  may damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts 
the impact of any of the occurrences or conditions described above could affect not only our relationship with the particular governmental agency involved  but also other agencies of the same or other governmental entities 
depending on the size of the engagement or the magnitude of the potential costs  penalties or negative publicity involved  any of these occurrences or conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 

table of contents we have invested in specialized technology and other intellectual property for which we may fail to fully recover our investment or which may become obsolete 
we have invested in developing specialized technology and intellectual property  including proprietary systems  processes and methodologies  that we believe provide us a competitive advantage in serving our current clients and winning new engagements 
many of our service offerings rely on specialized technology or intellectual property that is subject to rapid change  and to the extent that this technology and intellectual property is rendered obsolete and of no further use to us or our clients  our ability to continue offering these services  and grow our revenues  could be adversely affected 
there is no assurance that we will be able to develop new  innovative or improved technology or intellectual property or that our technology and intellectual property will effectively compete with the intellectual property developed by our competitors 
if we are unable to develop new technology and intellectual property or if our competitors develop better technology or intellectual property  our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected 
if the integrity of our information systems is compromised or our information systems are inadequate to keep up with the needs of our business  our reputation  business and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we depend on information systems to manage and run our business 
additionally  certain services we provide require us to store  transmit or process sensitive or confidential client information  including personal consumer information and health or other personally identifiable information 
if any person  including any of our employees or third party vendors with whom we contract for data hosting services  negligently disregards or intentionally breaches the information security controls we have implemented to protect our clients data  or those security controls prove to be inadequate  we could incur legal liability and may also be subject to regulatory enforcement actions  fines and or criminal prosecution in multiple jurisdictions 
our potential liability in the event of a security breach of client data could be significant and depending on the circumstances giving rise to the breach  this liability may not be subject to a contractual limit of liability or an exclusion of consequential or indirect damages 
any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential data  whether through systems failure  employee negligence  fraud or misappropriation  could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients 
similarly  unauthorized access to or through our information systems  including an intentional attack by a person or persons who may develop and deploy viruses  worms or other malicious software programs  could result in negative publicity  legal liability and damage to our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  the scale and complexity of our business and new service offerings may require additional information systems that we may not be able to implement in a timely or cost effective manner 
this may impair our ability to achieve our operating objectives and retain our competitive position  which in turn could adversely affect our results of operations 
we may be exposed to potential risks if we are unable to achieve and maintain effective internal controls 
if we fail to achieve and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting or fail to implement necessary new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes  we may fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis  and may be unable to adequately or accurately report on our business and our results of operations 
even with adequate internal controls  we may not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud 
also  internal controls that are currently adequate may in the future become inadequate because of changes in conditions  and the degree of compliance with our policies or procedures may deteriorate 
this could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our stock 
acquired businesses may not achieve expected results which could adversely affect our financial performance 
we have grown our business  in part  through the acquisition of complementary businesses 
the substantial majority of the purchase price we pay for acquired businesses is related to goodwill and intangible assets 
we may not be able to realize the value of those assets or otherwise realize anticipated synergies unless we are able 
table of contents to effectively integrate the businesses we acquire 
we face multiple challenges in integrating acquired businesses and their personnel  including differences in corporate cultures and management styles  retention of personnel  conflict issues with clients  and the need to divert managerial resources that would otherwise be dedicated to our current businesses 
additionally  certain senior level consultants  as sellers of the acquired businesses  are bound by non competition covenants that expire after a specific amount of time from the date of acquisition 
when these covenants expire  our ability to retain these senior level consultants could significantly impact the acquired businesses 
any failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses and retain personnel could cause the acquired businesses to fail to achieve their expected results  which would in turn  adversely affect our financial performance and may require a possible impairment of the acquired assets 
additionally  the financing of acquisitions through cash  borrowings or common stock could also impair our liquidity or cause significant stock dilution 
goodwill and other intangible assets represent a significant portion of our assets  and an impairment of these assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
because we have acquired a significant number of businesses  goodwill and other intangible assets represent a significant portion of our assets 
under generally accepted accounting principles  we are required to perform an impairment test at the reporting unit level on our goodwill and  on a quarterly basis  we are required to assess both goodwill and long lived intangible assets 
we consider our operating segments to be our reporting units 
we may need to perform an impairment test more frequently if events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate  attrition of key personnel  a prolonged decline in our stock price and market capitalization  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  sale or disposition of a significant portion of one of our businesses  and other factors 
for example  during the year ended december   we recorded an impairment charge of million related to certain customer lists and relationships and non compete agreements in two markets within our international consulting segment 
if the fair market value of one of our reporting units or other long term assets is less than the carrying amount of the related assets  we could be required to record an impairment charge in the future 
the valuation of the reporting units requires judgment in estimating future cash flows  discount rates and other factors 
in making these judgments  we evaluate the financial health of our reporting units  including such factors as market performance  changes in our client base and projected growth rates 
because these factors are ever changing  due to market and general business conditions  we cannot predict whether  and to what extent  our goodwill and long lived intangible assets may be impaired in future periods 
at december   we had goodwill of million and net intangible assets of million 
the amount of any future impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial results

this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations relates to  and should be read in conjunction with  our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are an independent specialty consulting firm that combines deep industry knowledge with broad technical expertise 
we focus on industries that typically undergo substantial regulatory or structural change and provide services to enable clients to manage the uncertainty  risk and distress caused by those changes 
the nature of our services  as well as our clients demand for our services are impacted not only by these regulatory and structural changes  but also by the united states and global economy and other significant events specific to our clients 
our clients demand for our services ultimately drives our revenues and expenses 
we derive our revenues from fees on services provided 
the majority of our revenues are generated on a time and materials basis  though we also have engagements where fees are a fixed amount either in total or for a period of time 
from time to time  we may also earn incremental revenues  in addition to hourly or fixed fees  which are contingent on the attainment of certain contractual milestones or objectives 
we also recognize revenues from business referral fees or commissions on certain contractual outcomes 
these performance based and referral revenues may cause unusual variations in our quarterly revenues and results of operations 
regardless of the terms of our fee arrangements  our ability to earn those fees is reliant on deploying consultants with the experience and expertise to deliver services 
our most significant expense is consultant compensation  which includes salaries  incentive compensation  amortization of sign on and retention incentive payments  share based compensation and benefits 
consultant compensation is included in cost of services before reimbursable expenses  in addition to sales and marketing expenses and the direct costs of recruiting and training consultants 
our most significant overhead expenses are administrative compensation and benefits and office related expenses 
administrative compensation includes salaries  incentive compensation  share based compensation and benefits for corporate management and administrative personnel  that indirectly support client engagements 
office related expenses primarily consist of rent for our offices 
other administrative costs include bad debt expense  marketing  technology  finance and human capital management 
because our ability to derive fees is largely reliant on the hiring and retention of personnel  the average number of full time equivalents fte and our ability to keep consultants utilized are important drivers of the business 
the average number of full time equivalent fte consultants is adjusted for part time status and takes into account hiring and attrition which occurred during the reporting period 
our average utilization rate as defined below provides a benchmark for how well we are managing our fte s in response to changing demand 
while hiring and retention of personnel is key to driving revenues  fte levels and related consultant compensation in excess of demand drive additional costs that can negatively impact margin 
from time to time  we hire independent contractors to supplement our consultants on certain engagements  which allows us to adjust staffing in response to changes in demand for our services  and manage our costs accordingly 
in connection with recruiting activities and business acquisitions  our general policy is to obtain non solicitation covenants from senior and some mid level consultants 
most of these covenants have restrictions that extend months beyond the termination of employment 
we utilize these contractual agreements and other agreements to reduce the risk of attrition and to safeguard our existing clients  staff and projects 
in addition to managing the number of employees and utilization of consultants  we also continually review and adjust our consultants total compensation including salaries  annual cash incentive compensation  other cash and share based compensation  and benefits to ensure that it is competitive within the industry and is consistent with our performance 
we also monitor and adjust our bill rates according to then current market conditions for our service offerings and within the various industries we serve 
additional information about our operations is included in the preceding business section

key operating metrics we include the following metrics in order to provide additional operating information related to our business and reporting segments 
these key operating metrics may not be comparable to similarly titled metrics at other companies 
average fte represents our average headcount during the period adjusted for part time status 
average fte is further split between consulting individuals assigned to client service who record time to client engagements  technology individuals assigned to client service who provide technology services and do not record time to specific client engagements  and non billable individuals assigned to administrative and support functions  including office services  corporate functions  and certain practice support functions 
period end fte represents our headcount at the last day of the reporting period adjusted for part time status 
consulting  technology  and non billable criteria also apply to period end fte 
average bill rate excluding performance based fees is calculated by dividing fee revenues before certain adjustments such as discounts and markups  by the number of hours associated with the fee revenue 
fee revenues and hours on performance based services and related to technology fte are excluded from average bill rate 
average utilization rate is calculated by dividing the number of hours of our consulting fte which excludes technology fte who recorded time to client engagements during a period  by the total available working hours for these consultants during the same period  hours 

table of contents billable hours are the number of hours our consulting fte which excludes technology fte recorded time to client engagements during the reporting period 
segment operating profit represents total revenues less costs of services excluding long term compensation expense attributable to consultants 
long term compensation expense related to consultants includes share based compensation expense and compensation expense attributed to retention incentives 
prior period comparative metric data has been restated to be consistent with the current presentation

revenues before reimbursements increased by in compared to the increase was primarily due to improvements driven by strength in the business consulting services segment which includes our energy and healthcare operating segments as well as improved performances in the disputes and investigative services segment and the international consulting segment

consultant utilization improved to from in  while average billable fte s increased to  compared to  in average bill rate excluding performance based fees was for  up from in for the years ended and  performance based fees were million and million  respectively 
the increase in performance based fees was driven mainly by successes in our restructuring and healthcare practices within the business consulting services segment 
cost of services before reimbursable expenses 
cost of services before reimbursable expenses increased in compared to the increased cost of services was mainly due to higher performance based incentive compensation  wages and benefits increasing with headcount and  overall  solid revenue growth and improvement in our operating results 
in addition  amortization of certain recruiting incentives  retention and performance based incentives were higher in mainly due to and senior level hires 
these increases were partially offset by lower consultant severance costs which were million and million for the years ended and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  in compared to consistent with our improved financial performance  higher incentive compensation expense  along with rising information technology costs and additional costs related to acquisitions  drove most of the increase and was partially offset by lower bad debt expense  which decreased from average general and administrative fte s were up while supporting additional consulting fte s

other operating costs benefit intangible assets impairment 
during  we recorded an intangible assets impairment charge of million related to customer lists and relationships and non compete agreements in two markets within our international consulting segment 
depreciation expense 
the decrease in depreciation expense of for compared to was primarily due to the full depreciation of certain assets and relatively lower spending on property and equipment in recent years 
amortization expense 
amortization decreased by million  or in compared to this was due to reduced amortization associated with certain intangible assets within our international consulting segment which were subject to an impairment charge recorded during the three months ended december  in addition certain intangible assets became fully amortized as their useful lives came to term 
this decrease was partially offset by increased amortization relating to our recent acquisitions

our effective income tax rate in was compared to in a non recurring tax benefit of million in was offset by the positive impact in of increased income in the united kingdom which has lower tax rates 
results for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues before reimbursements 
our revenues before reimbursements decreased compared to average fte consultants for decreased due to higher attrition rates  the repositioning of several service lines in and certain late and early departures 
the decrease was partially offset by improvements in our average bill rate and the impact of our recent acquisitions

average bill rate increased for compared to  mainly as a result of a higher mix of more senior consultant utilization and overall efforts to increase rates in on a pro forma basis including the impact of our recent acquisitions in both periods  our revenues before reimbursements for would have decreased approximately from cost of services before reimbursable expenses 
cost of services before reimbursable expenses was relatively consistent during and cost of services in was impacted by lower compensation expense  mainly due to wage savings from redeployment of certain service areas and cost savings initiatives which included staffing reductions and managing salary adjustments mainly in response to lower demand 
severance costs relating to cost of services during and were million and million  respectively 
these savings were partially offset by higher incentive compensation expense during  as a result of improved operating performance in certain markets  higher practice development costs and the cost impact of recent acquisitions

other operating costs benefit office consolidation 
during  we re occupied one floor of office space at one of our new york locations in connection with expanded business subsequent to our second quarter acquisition of daylight 
as a result  we reversed million of the accrual for future rent obligation and recorded a benefit to other operating costs 
in addition  we recorded additional costs of million to increase our reserves for future rent obligations for one of our abandoned chicago office spaces as a result of continued weak sublease market conditions 
during  we recorded million for office closure related costs 
the costs consisted of adjustments to office closure obligations and accelerated depreciation on leasehold improvements in offices to be abandoned  due to costs associated with the relocation of our new york office and a reduction in space of our los angeles office 
the office closure related costs were also negatively impacted by the adjustments to estimated future sublease income due to the poor commercial property sublease market in the united states 

table of contents other operating costs benefit intangible assets impairment 
during the three months ended december   we recorded an intangible asset impairment charge of million related to customer lists and relationships and non compete agreements in two markets within our international consulting segment 
certain markets within the international consulting segment experienced weaker revenues before reimbursements throughout the public services market was negatively impacted by significant reductions to public spending as a result of a change in government in the united kingdom 
in response to these reductions  we continued to implement cost reduction plans throughout the fourth quarter of as the severity and speed of the spending cuts was greater than our initial expectations 
in addition  our financial services market experienced aggressive recruiting of our consultants from larger competitors  particularly impacting fourth quarter results  as the financial services consulting markets recovered from recent disruptions in the united kingdom 
as a result of the events above and in connection with our annual planning process  we lowered the expected future growth rates and profit margins for these market segments 
these events and the resulting lower cash flows from these markets required us to review the recoverability of the related intangible assets 
during our review of intangible asset values  we determined that the carrying value of the intangible assets relating to the public services and financial service areas were not recoverable 
since the impairment was a non cash charge  it did not have an impact on our liquidity or financial covenants 
depreciation expense 
the decrease in depreciation expense of for compared to was primarily due to the full depreciation of certain assets and relatively lower spending on property and equipment in recent years 
amortization expense 
the decrease in amortization expense of for compared to was primarily due to the lapse of amortization for certain intangible assets as such assets useful lives came to term 
the decrease was partially offset by increased amortization relating to recent acquisitions 
interest expense 
the decrease in interest expense for of million compared to related primarily to the expiration of an unfavorable interest rate swap in june and lower average borrowing balances under our credit agreement and our term loan 
in january  using our excess cash  we made an unscheduled repayment on our term loan of million 
our average borrowing rate under our credit agreement including the impact of our interest rate swap agreements  see note comprehensive income to the notes to our consolidated financial statements was and for and  respectively 
income tax expense 
our effective income tax rate for and was and  respectively 
the rate decreased in mainly due to the deemed liquidation of certain foreign entities  as allowed under an election made for us tax purposes  which resulted in the intercompany debt obligations held by these foreign entities to be considered uncollectible 
the election was made in connection with certain operating changes in these entities and resulted in a non recurring deduction  for us tax purposes  of million 
the non recurring tax benefit associated with this event was million during the foreign entities that made the election will be treated  for us tax purposes only  as single member limited liability companies and their resulting net income or loss will be reported on the consolidated us income tax return 
the overall lower effective tax rate during was partially offset by a lower deferred tax benefit on the international consulting segment intangible assets impairment as a result of the lower tax rate in the united kingdom 
we generated a taxable loss in the united kingdom during and had net deferred tax assets of approximately million as of december  segment results our business is organized in four reporting segments business consulting services  dispute and investigative services  economic consulting  and international consulting 
these reporting segments are generally defined by the nature of their services and geography and may be the aggregation of multiple operating segments as indicated in the description below

table of contents operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of a number of factors  including the significance of client engagements commenced and completed during a quarter  timing of acquisitions  the number of business days in a quarter  employee hiring and utilization rates 
the timing of revenues varies from quarter to quarter due to various factors  including the ability of clients to terminate engagements without penalty  attaining certain contractual objectives  the size and scope of assignments  and general economic conditions 
because a significant percentage of our expenses are relatively fixed  a variation in the number of client assignments  or the timing of the initiation or the completion of client assignments  can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
operating results are also impacted by other operating costs 
in addition  interest expense and interest income fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of balance changes in cash and debt 
liquidity and capital resources our cash flow activities were as follows shown in thousands for the years ended december  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities generally our net cash provided by operating activities is used to pay our day to day operating activities 
first quarter cash requirements are generally higher due to payment of our annual bonus incentives 
improved financial results and increased collections drove our strong cash flow generation in as a result of increased cash from operations we were able to reduce our debt by over million during in addition  we repurchased  shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of per share 
during the year ended december  we also entered into a new unsecured credit agreement which is described in detail below under debt  commitments and capital and bolstered our technology services with the acquisition of ignited solutions  llc and capital expenditures relating to leasehold improvements and internal software development 
based on the financial covenant restrictions contained in our credit agreement  at december  we had approximately million of borrowing capacity under our credit facility  providing us with significant financial flexibility 
our cash equivalents are primarily limited to money market accounts or a rated securities  with maturity dates of days or less 
we calculate accounts receivable days sales outstanding dso by dividing the accounts receivable balance  net of reserves and deferred revenue credits  at the end of the quarter  by daily net revenues 
daily net revenues are calculated by taking quarterly net revenues divided by days  approximately equal to the number of days in a quarter 
calculated as such  dso was days at december   compared to days at december  and days at december  the decrease in dso resulted primarily from the improved collection efforts for our accounts receivable 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased to million for  compared to million and million for and  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities for compared to related to lower working capital requirements  higher revenue and improved collections

the decrease in cash used during compared to related to less cash 
table of contents used for acquisition payment obligations in addition to lower capital spending on property and equipment 
during we acquired daylight and ethospartners and had lower property and equipment expenditures than in capital spending was higher in mainly due to leasehold improvements at a new office located in new york city and software license agreements 
financing activities net cash used in financing activities was million in  compared to net cash used in financing activities of million and million in and  respectively 
during  excess cash provided by operating activities was used to reduce borrowings under our credit facility 
also in  we entered into a new credit agreement 
net proceeds from the new credit agreement of million were used for payment of the term loan and credit facility under the previous credit agreement which was terminated see debt  commitments and capital below 
in connection with the new credit agreement  we paid million in debt issuance costs 
additionally  we began a share repurchase program during the three months ended december  under this program we acquired  shares of our common stock in the open market for million 
during  we used excess cash to prepay million on our term loan facility which was partially offset by borrowings for acquisitions 
debt  commitments and capital on may   we entered into a new unsecured credit agreement with a syndicate of banks 
the credit agreement provides a five year  million revolving credit facility and replaced our previous credit agreement 
at our option  subject to the terms and conditions specified in the credit agreement  we may elect to increase the commitments under the credit facility up to an aggregate amount of million 
the credit facility matures on may   at which time borrowings will be payable in full 
borrowings and repayments may be made in multiple currencies including us dollars  canadian dollars  uk pound sterling and euro 
initial borrowings of million under the credit facility were used to repay borrowings outstanding under the previous credit agreement 
at december   we had aggregate borrowings of million  compared to million at december  based on our financial covenant restrictions at december   a maximum of approximately million was available in additional borrowings under the new credit facility 
at our option  borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a variable rate equal to an applicable base rate or libor  in each case plus an applicable margin 
for libor loans  the applicable margin will vary depending upon our consolidated leverage ratio the ratio of total funded debt to adjusted ebitda  as defined in the credit agreement 
at december   the applicable margins on libor and base rate loans were and  respectively 
depending upon our performance and financial condition  our libor loans will have applicable margins varying between and and our base rate loans will have applicable margins varying between zero and 
our average borrowing rate including the impact of our interest rate swap agreements  see note comprehensive income was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our credit agreement contains certain financial covenants  including covenants that require that we maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of not greater than except for the first quarter of each calendar year when the covenant requires us to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of not greater than and a consolidated interest coverage ratio the ratio of the sum of adjusted ebitda as defined in the credit agreement and rental expense to the sum of cash interest expense and rental expense of not less than at december   under the definitions in the credit agreement  our consolidated leverage ratio was and our consolidated interest coverage ratio was in addition  the credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants subject to customary exceptions  including covenants that limit our ability to incur liens or other encumbrances  make investments  incur indebtedness  enter into mergers  consolidations and asset sales  change the nature of our business and engage in transactions with affiliates  as well as customary provisions with respect to events of default 
we were in compliance with the terms of our credit agreements as of december  and  however  there can be no assurances that we will remain in compliance in the future 

table of contents at december   we had total commitments of million 
the following table shows the components of our significant commitments at december  and the scheduled years of payments shown in thousands contractual obligations total to to thereafter deferred purchase price obligations cash purchase agreements revolving credit facility lease commitments of the million lease commitments at december   million are related to offices we have abandoned or reduced excess space within  which have been subleased or are available for sublease 
at december   we had contractual subleases of million  which is not reflected in the commitment table above 
such sublease income would offset the cash outlays 
we may seek to exercise termination clauses  if any  to shorten the term of the lease commitments 
the lease commitments for these offices extend through we have commitments of approximately million relating to costs associated with an information technology infrastructure project that we commenced during the quarter ended december  to support our corporate technology needs in addition to the needs of our expanding technology business 
in addition  we have various contracts with information technology related vendors to support our enterprise reporting system and although the contracts are non cancelable the terms contain termination clauses which would allow us to terminate the contracts for a penalty 
we do not expect  however  to terminate these contracts and expect to pay approximately million over the next three years 
on october   our board of directors extended until december  its previous authorization to repurchase up to million of our common stock  in open market or private transactions 
the previous authorization was scheduled to expire on december  during the quarter ended december  we repurchased  shares for approximately million 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  future cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit facility will provide adequate liquidity to fund anticipated short term and long term operating activities 
however  in the event we make significant cash expenditures in the future for major acquisitions or other unanticipated activities  we may require more liquidity than is currently available to us under our credit facility and may need to raise additional funds through debt or equity financings  as appropriate 
in addition  if our lenders are not able to fund their commitments due to disruptions in the financial markets or otherwise  our liquidity could also be negatively impacted 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenues when evidence of an arrangement exists  the price of work is fixed or determinable  work is performed and collectability is reasonably assured 
we generate the majority of our revenues from providing services under the following types of billing arrangements time and material  fixed fee and transaction event based 

table of contents for our time and material billing arrangements  clients are invoiced based on the number of hours worked by our consultants at the contracted bill rates  which are reviewed on a periodic basis 
revenue is recognized as work is performed on our time and material engagements 
additionally  revenue is recognized on our units of production engagements in a similar manner based on measures such as the number of items processed at agreed upon rates 
with our fixed fee billing engagements  we are contracted to complete a pre determined set of professional services for a pre determined fee 
however  the fee and engagement scope can be adjusted based on a mutual agreement between us and the client 
in many cases  the recording of fixed revenue amounts requires us to make an estimate of the total amount of work to be performed  and revenues are then recognized as efforts are expended based on i objectively determinable output measures  ii input measures if output measures are not reliable or iii the straight line method over the term of the arrangement 
in transaction or event based billing arrangements  fees are tied to the completion of contractually defined requirements 
in many cases  this contingent fee is earned in addition to an hourly or fixed fee  but is not recognized until certain milestones or objectives are met 
we also recognize revenue from business referral fees or commissions on certain contractual outcomes 
revenue recognized by transaction or event based billing arrangements may cause unusual variations in quarterly revenues and operating results 
in connection with recording revenues  estimates and assumptions are required in determining the expected conversion of the revenues to cash 
we may provide multiple services under the terms of an arrangement and are required to assess whether one or more units of accounting are present 
reimbursable expenses for our engagements include transportation  lodging  out of pocket and independent contractor costs 
such expenses are included in our revenue as applicable and are passed through to cost of services 
typically  reimbursable expenses are recognized as revenue during the period in which the expenses are incurred 
revenues recognized for services performed but not yet billed are recorded as unbilled receivables on our consolidated balance sheet 
advance payments and retainers are recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized as services are provided 
any taxes assessed on revenues relating to services provided to our clients are recorded on a net basis 
accounts receivable realization we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from our review and assessment of our clients ability to make required payments  and the estimated realization  in cash  by us of amounts due from our clients 
if our clients financial condition were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
notes receivable and prepaid sign on and retention bonuses we grant and pay sign on and retention bonuses to attract and retain highly skilled consultants 
generally  we require grantees to sign incentive recovery agreements  which obligate the grantees to fulfill a service term  typically between one to five years 
if such service term is not fulfilled  the monetary equivalent of the uncompleted service term is required to be paid back to us 
we record paid sign on and retention bonuses to current and non current other assets and the bonuses are amortized as compensation expense over the service period as defined by the incentive recovery agreements 
certain sign on and retention bonuses of relatively low amounts are expensed to compensation expense when paid 
we also issue notes receivable in the form of unsecured employee loans with terms generally three to five years 
these loans were issued to recruit and retain highly skilled consultants 
the principal amount and accrued interest is either paid by the consultant or forgiven by us over the term of the loans  so long as the consultants continue employment and comply with certain contractual requirements 
the expense associated with the forgiveness of the principal amount of the loans and accrued interest is recorded as compensation expense over the service period  which is consistent with the term of the loans 
the accrued interest is calculated based on the loan s effective interest rate and is recorded as interest income 

table of contents business combinations we recognize and measure identifiable assets acquired  liabilities assumed and any non controlling interest in the acquiree as of the acquisition date at fair value 
fair value measurements require extensive use of estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows to be generated by the acquired assets 
in addition  we recognize and measure contingent consideration at fair value as of the acquisition date 
contingent consideration obligations that are classified as liabilities are remeasured at fair value each reporting period with the changes in fair value resulting from either the passage of time  revisions  or ultimate settlement to the amount or timing of the initial measurement recognized in income 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price of acquired companies and the related fair value of the net assets acquired  which is accounted for by the acquisition method of accounting 
intangible assets consist of identifiable intangibles other than goodwill 
identifiable intangible assets other than goodwill include customer lists and relationships  employee non compete agreements  backlog revenue and trade names 
our long term assets are subject to changes in events or circumstances that could impact their carrying value 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually during the second quarter 
in addition to our annual goodwill test  on a periodic basis  we are required to consider whether it is more likely than not that the fair value has fallen below the carrying amount of an asset and thus requiring us to perform an interim goodwill impairment test 
we consider elements and other factors including  but not limited to adverse changes in the business climate in which we operate  attrition of key personnel  unanticipated competition  our market capitalization in excess of our book value  our recent operating performance and or our financial projections 
the goodwill impairment test is performed at a reporting unit level 
a reporting unit as defined by asc is an operating segment of a business one level below if discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management 
the test is two steps and is fair value based 
the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value 
the fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis and a comparable company analysis 
the second step is performed only if the carrying value exceeds the fair value determined in step one 
at december   we had six operating segments which are also considered to be our reporting units  as follows healthcare  energy and other business consulting  which comprise our business consulting services reporting segment  dispute and investigative services  international consulting  and economic consulting 
during the first step  we determine the fair value of each reporting unit using estimated future cash flows and terminal values 
considerable management judgment is required to estimate future cash flows 
assumptions used in our impairment evaluations  such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital  are consistent with internal projections and operating plans 
the achievement of such internal projections and operating plans will be impacted by the overall economic environment  among other factors 
the estimated fair value of our six reporting units is subject to  among other things  changes in our estimated business future growth rate  profit margin  long term outlook  market valuations of comparable companies  the ability to retain key personnel  changes in operating segments  competitive environment and weighted average cost of capital 
we use various methods to determine fair value  including market  income and cost approaches 
with these approaches  we adopt certain assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability  including assumptions about risk or the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation 
inputs to the valuation can be readily observable  market corroborated or unobservable 
wherever possible  we use valuation techniques that 
table of contents maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs  however  due to the use of our own assumptions about the inputs in measuring fair value  our goodwill impairment testing also makes use of significant unobservable inputs 
the fair value of our reporting units is also impacted by our overall market capitalization and may be impacted by volatility in our stock price and assumed control premium  among other things 
our annual goodwill impairment test was completed in the second quarter of and was completed based on our six reporting units 
at that time  we completed the first step of the goodwill impairment test and determined that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its net asset carrying value 
accordingly  there was no indication of impairment and the second step was not performed 
intangible assets  other than goodwill  are amortized based on the period of consumption 
we review for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset s carrying value may not be recoverable 
share based payments we recognize the cost resulting from all share based compensation arrangements  including stock option  restricted stock and restricted stock units that we grant under our long term incentive plans in the financial statements based on their grant date fair value 
management judgment is required in order to i estimate the fair value of certain share based payments  ii determine expected attribution period and iii assess expected future forfeitures 
we treat our employee stock purchase plan as compensatory and record the purchase discount from market price of stock purchases by employees as share based compensation expense 
income taxes our income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and a number of foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense 
deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies  and results of recent operations 
when appropriate  we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets 
the evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance requires management judgment and could impact our financial results and effective tax rate 
recent accounting pronouncements recently issued standards in september  the financial accounting standards board issued guidance which will add an optional qualitative assessment to goodwill impairment testing under topic intangibles goodwill and other 
the new guidance permits an entity to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying the two step goodwill impairment test 
if an entity concludes that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  it would not be required to perform the two step impairment test for that reporting unit 
the guidance lists certain factors to consider when making the qualitative assessment 
the guidance is effective for annual or interim goodwill tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december   however  early adoption is permitted for annual or interim goodwill tests performed prior to september  the adoption of this guidance will not have any impact on our financial statements 
however  it will change our processes around goodwill impairment testing 

table of contents in june  the financial accounting standards board issued guidance which will require public entities to increase the prominence of other comprehensive income in financial statements 
under topic presentation of comprehensive income  an entity will have the option to present the components of net income and comprehensive income in either one or two financial statements 
this update eliminates the option to present other comprehensive income in the statement of changes in equity 
this update is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december  recently adopted standards in december  the financial accounting standards board issued guidance to clarify the acquisition date that should be used for reporting the pro forma financial information disclosures required by topic business combinations  when comparative financial statements are presented 
the update also requires additional disclosures of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments that are directly attributable to the business combination 
this update is effective for acquisitions made in the first fiscal year beginning after december  we have adopted this guidance effective january  the adoption of this guidance did not have any impact on our financial statements as it contains only disclosure requirements 
in march  the financial accounting standards board issued guidance on milestone accounting 
the guidance applies to transactions involving research or development deliverables or other units of accounting where a performance obligation is met over a period of time and a portion or all of the consideration is contingent upon achievement of a milestone 
after meeting specified criteria  entities can make an accounting policy election to recognize arrangement consideration received for achieving specified performance measures during the periods in which the milestones are achieved 
the update is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june  we have adopted this guidance effective january  and the impact on our statements of financial position  results of operations and cash flows was not material 
in september  the financial accounting standards board issued guidance on revenue recognition which changes the criteria required to separate deliverables into separate units of accounting when they are sold in bundled arrangements 
previously  entities were required to have vendor specific objective evidence of fair value or other third party evidence of fair value 
the elimination of these requirements to separate deliverables into separate units of accounting will put more focus on a vendor s assessment of whether delivered items in multiple element arrangements have standalone value 
the update is effective for arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  we have adopted this guidance effective january  and the impact on our statements of financial position  results of operations and cash flows was not material 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not maintain any off balance sheet arrangements  transactions  obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates and foreign currencies 
the interest rate risk is associated with borrowings under our credit facility and our investment portfolio  classified as cash equivalents 
the foreign currency risk is associated with our operations in foreign countries 
at december   borrowings under our credit facility bear interest  in general  based on a variable rate equal to an applicable base rate equal to the higher of a reference prime rate or one half of one percent above the federal funds rate or libor  in each case plus an applicable margin 
we are exposed to interest rate risk relating to the fluctuations in libor 
we use interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to fluctuations in libor 
in december  we entered into four interest rate swap agreements of equal amounts with four different banks for an aggregate notional value of million 
these agreements effectively fixed million of our 
table of contents libor base rate indebtedness at an average rate of beginning july  through may  in march  we entered into two interest rate swap agreements of equal amounts with two different banks for an aggregate notional value of million 
these agreements effectively fixed million of our libor base rate indebtedness at an average rate of beginning july  through may  in november  we entered into a million notional value forward starting interest rate swap agreement 
this agreement effectively fixed million of our libor base rate indebtedness at a rate of beginning june  through may  in december  we entered into two million notional value forward starting interest rate swap agreements 
these agreements effectively fixed million of our libor base rate indebtedness at a rate of beginning january  through december  at december   our interest rate swaps effectively fixed our libor base rate on million of our debt 
based on borrowings under the credit facility at december  and after giving effect to the impact of our interest rate swap agreements  our interest rate exposure is limited to million of debt  and each quarter point change in market interest rates would result in approximately a million change in annual interest expense 
at december   our cash equivalents were primarily limited to money market accounts or a rated securities  with maturity dates of days or less 
these financial instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates rise 
because of the short periods to maturity of these instruments  an increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
we operate in various foreign countries  which expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
at december   we had net assets of approximately million with a functional currency of the uk pound sterling and million with a functional currency of the canadian dollar related to our operations in the united kingdom and canada  respectively 
at december   we had immaterial net assets denominated in the non functional currency 
excess cash held outside the united states is immaterial and therefore we have limited exposure to repatriating funds back to the united states
