item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and applicable notes to our consolidated financial statements and other information included elsewhere in this annual report  including risk factors disclosed in part i  item a 
the following information contains forward looking statements  which are subject to risks and uncertainties 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  our actual results may differ from those expressed or implied by the forward looking statements 
see forward looking statements at the beginning of this annual report 
executive summary on february   we acquired complete production services  inc complete pursuant to a merger that substantially expanded the size and scope of our business 
except as otherwise noted  the description of our business contained in this item refers to the business of superior and its consolidated subsidiaries  including complete and its subsidiaries  except where we refer to results of operations or operating data prior to february  however  because the complete acquisition occurred during the fiscal year  but prior to our filing of this annual report  the accompanying financial statements reflect the results of superior s stand alone operations as of december  additional information on our acquisition of complete is included in note of our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report 
additionally  on february   we entered into an agreement to sell our marine segment  consisting of a fleet of liftboats 
we believe we are a leading  highly diversified provider of specialized oilfield services and equipment 
as a result of the complete acquisition  we significantly added to our us land geographic footprint and product and service offering 
we now offer a wider variety of products and services throughout the economic life of an oil and gas well 
the acquisition of complete greatly expanded our ability to offer more products and services related to the completion of a well prior to full production commencing  and enhanced our full suite of intervention services used to carry out wellbore maintenance operations during a well s producing phase 
we serve energy industry customers who focus on developing and producing oil and gas worldwide 
our operations are managed and organized by both business units and geomarkets offering product and service families within various phases of a well s economic lifecycle  including end of life services 
business unit and geomarket leaders report to executive vice presidents  and we report our operating results in three segments subsea and well enhancement  drilling products and services and marine 
given our history of growth and long term strategy of expanding geographically  we provide supplemental segment revenue information in three geographic areas us land  gulf of mexico  and international 
overview of our business segments the subsea and well enhancement segment consists of completion and workover services  production services and subsea and technical solutions  all of which are labor and equipment intensive 
in  approximately of segment revenue was from the us land market area up from in  while approximately of this segment s revenue was derived from work performed for customers in the gulf of mexico market area down from in and approximately of segment revenue was from international market areas which remained constant from 
following the acquisition of complete  a significantly larger amount of revenue from this segment is expected to come from the us land market areas 
we intend to continue to focus our capital expenditures on expanding our existing products and services into us land market areas that are driven by oil and liquids rich drilling and completion activity  and on expanding into new and existing international market areas 
in the us  the acquisition of complete will allow us to take advantage of opportunities with larger oil and gas producers that procure services from providers offering multiple and complementary product lines 
this segment s income from operations as a percentage of segment revenue operating margin can vary based on drilling and completion spending and activity  especially in the us land market areas 

table of contents the drilling products and services segment is capital intensive with higher operating margins as a result of relatively low operating expenses 
the largest fixed cost is depreciation as there is little labor associated with our drilling products and services businesses 
the financial performance is primarily a function of changes in volume rather than pricing 
in  approximately of segment revenue was derived from us land market areas up from in  while approximately of segment revenue was from the gulf of mexico market area down from in and approximately of segment revenue was from international market areas down from in 
three drilling products and their ancillary equipment accommodations  drill pipe and stabilization tools each accounted for more than of this segment s revenue in the marine segment is comprised of our rental liftboats 
operating costs of our liftboats are relatively fixed  and therefore  income from operations as a percentage of revenue can vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year based on changes in dayrates and utilization levels 
with all of our liftboats currently operating in the gulf of mexico  our activity levels can be impacted by harsh weather  especially tropical systems that occur during hurricane season 
we entered into an agreement on february  to sell our marine segment 
we expect this transaction to close in march of market drivers and conditions the oil and gas industry remains highly cyclical and seasonal 
activity levels are driven primarily by traditional energy industry activity indicators  which include current and expected commodity prices  drilling rig counts  well completions and workover activity  geological characteristics of producing wells which determine the number and intensity of services required per well  oil and gas production levels  and customers spending allocated for drilling and production work  which is reflected in our customers operating expenses or capital expenditures 
historical market indicators are listed below change change worldwide rig count us international commodity prices average crude oil west texas intermediate natural gas henry hub estimate of drilling activity as measured by average active drilling rigs based on baker hughes incorporated rig count information 
excludes canadian rig count 
as indicated by the table above  the major activity drivers continued to improve in the average number of drilling rigs working in the united states increased  while the international rig count increased 
the average price of west texas intermediate crude oil increased while the average price of henry hub natural gas decreased from 
table of contents the following table compares our revenues generated from major geographic regions for the years ended december  and in thousands 
we attribute revenue to countries based on the location where services are performed or the destination of the sale of products 
revenue change gulf of mexico us land international total in  our us land revenue increased to million as a result of higher oil prices  the increase in drilling rig counts particularly the number of rigs drilling horizontal wells in the us land market areas and higher overall industry activity which led to increased utilization of existing assets and high utilization of new assets added through capital expenditures 
in this market area  we experienced a increase in revenue from our subsea and well enhancement segment and a increase in revenue from our drilling products and services segment 
within individual product and service lines  the largest increases in the us land market area were in coiled tubing  cased hole wireline  pressure control tools  rentals of accommodations and rentals and sales of premium drill pipe and accessories 
our gulf of mexico revenue declined to million 
the slow recovery in activity following the deepwater horizon incident in april without the offsetting spill recovery work that we concluded in the fourth quarter of resulted in a slight decline in our gulf of mexico revenue 
drilling and production activity was slow to recover through most of due to the slow pace of permits issued for such projects early in the year 
while the incident curtailed much activity in the second half of  the incident also created demand for many of our products and services during the well capping and cleanup phases  which were completed in the fourth quarter of our international revenue increased to million due primarily to improved performance at hallin  increases in demand for completion tools  and down hole drilling products and hydraulic workover and snubbing services in latin america 
industry outlook we believe drivers of industry demand  commodity prices and drilling rig counts should remain favorable in most geographic market areas 
we also believe gulf of mexico deep water activity will continue to gradually increase 
we believe us land market areas with high concentrations of rigs drilling horizontal oil wells will remain underserved for products and services such as coiled tubing  premium drill pipe and ancillary products 
internationally  we expect to continue to build out market areas  such as australia and brazil  that provide us the best opportunities to provide as many products and services as possible 
we expect our capital expenditures allocated for expansion in the us land and international market areas will substantially increase over levels 
our gulf of mexico operations generally focus on three areas drilling support  production enhancement and decommissioning or end of life services 
our exposure to drilling activity is primarily in the drilling products and services segment 
we anticipate that our financial performance from the gulf of mexico in this segment will gradually increase as the number of permits for deep water drilling increases  resulting in more rigs drilling in than in the shallow water gulf of mexico  most of our revenue is related to production enhancement and end of life services 
we anticipate that demand for products and services participating in these market segments will remain stable 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note of our consolidated financial statements  which is included in part ii  item of this annual report  contains a description of the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis  including those related to long lived assets  goodwill  income taxes  allowance for doubtful accounts  revenue recognition  long term construction accounting  self insurance  and oil and gas properties 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we define a critical accounting policy or estimate as one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates about matters that are uncertain 
we believe that the following are the critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  there are other items within our consolidated financial statements that require estimates but are not deemed critical as defined in this paragraph 
long lived assets 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable 
we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when the fair value of those assets is less than their respective carrying amount 
fair value is measured  in part  by the estimated cash flows to be generated by those assets 
our cash flow estimates are based upon  among other things  historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market rates  utilization levels and operating performance 
our estimates of cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  changes in economic conditions or changes in an asset s operating performance 
assets are grouped by subsidiary or division for the impairment testing  except for liftboats  which are grouped together by leg length 
these groupings represent the lowest level of identifiable cash flows 
we have long lived assets  such as facilities  utilized by multiple operating divisions that do not have identifiable cash flows 
impairment testing for these long lived assets is based on the consolidated entity 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs to sell 
our estimate of fair value represents our best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market transactions and is subject to variability 
the oil and gas industry is cyclical and our estimates of the period over which future cash flows will be generated  as well as the predictability of these cash flows  can have a significant impact on the carrying value of these assets and  in periods of prolonged down cycles  may result in impairment charges 
as a result of pursuing strategic alternatives  we entered into an agreement dated february  to sell our marine segment 
as such  we concluded that indicators of impairment existed and therefore conducted a fair value assessment of our liftboats at december  this valuation included two components estimated undiscounted cash flows and indicated valuation evidenced by tenders from prospective buyers 
we then applied a weighted average to the two components to obtain an estimate of the fair market value of the liftboats 
based on this valuation analysis  we determined that the liftboats had a fair market value that was approximately million less than their carrying value 
therefore  a reduction in the value of assets property  plant and equipment was recorded for approximately million 
goodwill 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill  we make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
we test goodwill for impairment in accordance with authoritative guidance related to goodwill and other intangibles  which requires that goodwill as well as other intangible assets with indefinite lives not be amortized  but instead tested annually for impairment 
our annual testing of goodwill is based on carrying value and our estimate of fair value at december we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units which are consistent with our business segments using various cash flow and earnings projections discounted at a rate estimated to approximate the reporting units 
table of contents weighted average cost of capital 
we then compare these fair value estimates to the carrying value of our reporting units 
if the fair value of the reporting units exceeds the carrying amount  no impairment loss is recognized 
our estimates of the fair value of these reporting units represent our best estimates based on industry trends and reference to market transactions 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events 
we completed our assessment as of december  to determine whether our goodwill was impaired  and as a result we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our marine segment was less than its carrying amount  indicating that goodwill was potentially impaired 
as a result  we initiated the second step of the goodwill impairment test which involved calculating the implied fair value of our goodwill by allocating the fair value of the marine segment to all of the assets and liabilities other than goodwill and comparing it to the carrying amount of goodwill 
we determined that the implied fair value of our goodwill for our marine segment was less than its carrying value and wrote off the segment s goodwill balance of million  which was recorded as a reduction in the value of assets 
based on business conditions and market values that existed at december   we concluded that no goodwill impairment was required in our subsea and well enhancement and drilling and product services segments 
income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
this method takes into account the differences between financial statement treatment and tax treatment of certain transactions 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
our deferred tax calculation requires us to make certain estimates about our future operations 
changes in state  federal and foreign tax laws  as well as changes in our financial condition or the carrying value of existing assets and liabilities  could affect these estimates 
the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that the rate is enacted 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of some of our customers to make required payments 
these estimated allowances are periodically reviewed on a case by case basis  analyzing the customer s payment history and information regarding the customer s creditworthiness known to us 
in addition  we record a reserve based on the size and age of all receivable balances against those balances that do not have specific reserves 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in their inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
revenue recognition 
our products and services are generally sold based upon purchase orders or contracts with customers that include fixed or determinable prices 
we recognize revenue when services or equipment are provided and collectability is reasonably assured 
we contract for marine  subsea and well enhancement and environmental projects either on a day rate or turnkey basis  with a majority of our projects conducted on a day rate basis 
the products we rent within our drilling products and services segment are rented on a day rate basis  and revenue from the sale of equipment is recognized when the title to the equipment has transferred to the customer 
long term construction accounting for revenue and profit loss recognition 
a portion of our revenue is derived from long term contracts 
for contracts that meet the criteria under the authoritative guidance related to construction type and production type contracts  we recognize revenues on the percentage of completion method  primarily based on costs incurred to date compared with total estimated contract costs 
it is possible there will be future and currently unforeseeable significant adjustments to our estimated contract revenues  costs and profitability for contracts currently in process 
these adjustments could  depending on the magnitude of the adjustments  materially  positively or negatively  affect our operating results in an annual or quarterly reporting period 
to the extent that an adjustment in the estimated total contract cost impacts estimated profit of the contract  the cumulative change to revenue and profitability is reflected in the period in which this adjustment in 
table of contents estimate is identified 
the accuracy of the revenue and estimated earnings we report for fixed price contracts is dependent upon the judgments we make in estimating our contract performance and contract revenue and costs 
we use the percentage of completion method for recognizing our revenues and related costs on our contract to decommission seven downed oil and gas platforms and related well facilities located in the gulf of mexico 
during the fourth quarter of  as the project to decommission seven downed oil and gas platforms and well facilities neared completion  we determined it was necessary to increase the total cost estimate due to various well conditions and other technical issues associated with this complex and challenging project see note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report 
self insurance 
we self insure  through deductibles and retentions  up to certain levels for losses related to workers compensation  third party liability insurances  property damage  and group medical 
with our growth  we have elected to retain more risk by increasing our self insurance 
we accrue for these liabilities based on estimates of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
we regularly review our estimates of reported and unreported claims and provide for losses through reserves 
we obtain actuarial reviews to evaluate the reasonableness of internal estimates for losses related to workers compensation and group medical on an annual basis 
our financial results could be impacted if litigation trends  claims settlement patterns and future inflation rates are different from our estimates 
oil and gas properties 
our subsidiary  wild well control inc wild well  and our equity method investment  dynamic offshore holding  lp dynamic offshore  have oil and gas properties and the related well abandonment and decommissioning liabilities 
each of these entities follows the successful efforts method of accounting for their investment in oil and gas properties 
under the successful efforts method  the costs of successful exploratory wells and leases containing productive reserves are capitalized 
costs incurred to drill and equip developmental wells  including unsuccessful developmental wells  are capitalized 
other costs such as geological and geophysical costs and the drilling costs of unsuccessful exploratory wells are expensed 
all capitalized costs are accumulated and recorded separately for each field and allocated to leasehold costs and well costs 
leasehold costs and well costs are depleted on a units of production basis based on the estimated remaining equivalent proved developed oil and gas reserves of the field 
we estimate the third party market price to plug and abandon wells  abandon pipelines  decommission and remove platforms and clear sites  and use that estimate to record our proportionate share of the decommissioning liability 
in estimating the decommissioning liabilities  we perform detailed estimating procedures  analysis and engineering studies 
whenever practical  we will utilize the services of our subsidiaries to perform well abandonment and decommissioning work 
when these services are performed by our subsidiaries  all recorded intercompany revenues and expenses are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 
the recorded decommissioning liability associated with a specific property is fully extinguished when the property is completely abandoned 
the liability is first reduced by all cash expenses incurred to abandon and decommission the property 
if the liability exceeds or is less than our incurred costs  the difference is reported as income or loss in the period in which the work is performed 
we review the adequacy of our decommissioning liability whenever indicators suggest that the estimated cash flows underlying the liability have changed materially 
the timing and amounts of these cash flows are subject to changes in the energy industry environment and may result in additional liabilities recorded  which in turn would increase the carrying values of the related properties 
oil and gas properties are assessed for impairment in value on a field by field basis whenever indicators become evident 
we use our current estimate of future revenues and operating expenses to test the capitalized costs for impairment 
in the event net undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recorded based on the present value of expected future net cash flows over the economic lives of the reserves 
proved reserve estimates 
our reserve information is prepared by independent reserve engineers in accordance with guidelines established by the securities and exchange commission 
there are a number of uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves  including many factors beyond our control such as 
table of contents commodity pricing 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s guidelines  we use twelve month average prices  year end costs and a discount rate to determine the present value of future net cash flow 
actual prices and costs may vary significantly  and the discount rate may or may not be appropriate based on outside economic conditions 
comparison of the results of operations for the years ended december  and for the year ended december   our revenue was  million and our net income was million  or diluted earnings per share 
included in the results for the year ended december  were non cash pre tax charges of million for the reduction in value of assets within our marine segment 
for the year ended december   our revenue was  million and our net income was million  or diluted earnings per share 
included in the results for the year ended december  were pre tax management transition expenses of approximately million  as well as non cash pre tax charges of million for the reduction in value of assets within our marine segment

revenue cost of services  rentals and sales change change subsea and well enhancement drilling products and services marine total the following discussion analyzes our results on a segment basis 
subsea and well enhancement segment revenue for our subsea and well enhancement segment was  million for the year ended december   as compared to  million for cost of services remained constant at of segment revenue in both and our increase in revenue and profitability is due to demand increases in the us land and international market areas 
revenue from our us land market area increased approximately due to demand for coiled tubing  cased hole wireline  well control and pressure pumping services  as well as hydraulic workover and snubbing services 
additionally  revenue from our international market areas increased approximately primarily due increased revenue from our subsea projects  well control services  hydraulic workover and snubbing services and our acquisition of superior completion services in august of revenue from our gulf of mexico market area decreased approximately primarily based on a decline in revenue from work associated with our large scale decommissioning project as well as a decrease in well control services 
the decrease in the gulf of mexico was partially offset by increased revenue from cased hole wireline services  hydraulic snubbing and workover services and the acquisition of superior completion services in drilling products and services segment revenue for our drilling products and services segment was million for the year ended december   an approximate increase from cost of services decreased slightly to of segment revenue in 
table of contents from in the increase in revenue for this segment is primarily related to rentals of our accommodation units  drill pipe and specialty tubulars  specifically in our us land market area 
revenue in our us land market area increased approximately for the year ended december  over the same period in revenue generated from our international market areas increased approximately for the year ended december  over the same period in this increase was primarily related to increased rentals of drill pipe and specialty tubulars 
revenue from our gulf of mexico market area remained essentially flat due to the lingering effects of the macondo oil spill in april marine segment our marine segment revenue for the year ended december  decreased approximately from to million 
our cost of services percentage remained constant at of segment revenue for the years ended december  and due to the high fixed cost nature of this segment  cost of services does not fluctuate proportionately with revenue 
the fleet s average utilization decreased to approximately in from in however  the fleet s average dayrate increased to approximately  in from  in this is primarily due to the fact that our two foot class vessels  which typically generate our highest day rates  returned to work in the fourth quarter of after being taken out of service for repairs in the fourth quarter of during  we sold seven of our smaller liftboats for million and recorded gains of approximately million 
in december  we also sold one of our foot class liftboats for million and recorded a gain of approximately million 
on february   we entered into an agreement to sell the assets comprising our marine segment  or liftboats 
we expect this transaction to close in march of depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion increased to million for the year ended december  from million in depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion expense related to our subsea and well enhancement segment increased million  or  in from the same period in increases in depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion are related to the acquisition of superior completion services  capital expenditures and increased utilization of subsea vessels 
depreciation and amortization expense increased within our drilling products and services segment by million  or  due to capital expenditures 
depreciation expense related to the marine segment remained constant for the years ended december  and general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million in  which included approximately million of management transition expenses 
increases in general and administrative expenses are attributable to the acquisition of superior completion services and increased bonus and compensation expense due to our improved performance as well as additional infrastructure to enhance our growth 
reduction in value of assets as a result of pursuing strategic alternatives  we entered into an agreement on february  to sell our marine segment 
as such  we recorded a reduction in the value of assets for approximately million which included a write down of property and equipment of approximately million and a write down of goodwill of approximately million 
during  we recorded a reduction in the value of assets totaling million in connection with liftboat components primarily related to two partially completed liftboats 
after a detailed evaluation  we concluded in december that it was impractical to complete these vessels 
as such  we reduced our carrying value in these assets to their respective net realizable value 

table of contents comparison of the results of operations for the years ended december  and for the year ended december   our revenue was  million and our net income was million  or diluted earnings per share 
included in the results for the year ended december  were pre tax management transition expenses of approximately million  as well as non cash pre tax charges of million for the reduction in value of assets within our marine segment

subsea and well enhancement segment revenue for our subsea and well enhancement segment was  million for the year ended december   as compared to million for our increase in revenue and profitability is primarily due to demand increases in the us land and international market areas 
revenue from our us land market area increased approximately due to demand for coiled tubing  cased hole wireline  well control services and hydraulic workover and snubbing services 
additionally  revenue from our international market areas increased approximately primarily due to our acquisition of hallin along with increased revenue from our well control services and hydraulic workover and snubbing services 
revenue from our gulf of mexico market area decreased approximately primarily based on a decline in revenue from work associated with our large scale decommissioning project 
this decrease was partially offset by increased well control work and plug and abandonment activity  as well as our acquisitions of superior completion services and the bullwinkle platform 
cost of services decreased to of segment revenue in  as compared to of segment revenue in similar to revenue  our profitability increased due to increased demand for coiled tubing  cased hole wireline  well control services and hydraulic workover and snubbing services 
additionally  cost of services as a percentage of revenue for was impacted due to the adjustment related to our large scale decommissioning project 
during the fourth quarter of as we neared completion of this project  we determined it was necessary to increase our total cost estimate due to various well conditions and other technical issues associated with this complex and challenging project 
as the revenue related to this long term contract is recorded on the percentage of completion method utilizing costs incurred as a percentage of total estimated costs  the cumulative effect of changes to estimated total contract costs was recognized in the period in which revisions were identified 
drilling products and services segment revenue for our drilling products and services segment was million for the year ended december   an approximate increase from cost of services increased to of segment revenue in 
table of contents from in the increase in revenue for this segment is primarily related to rentals of our accommodation units and specialty tubulars  specifically in our us land market area 
revenue in our us land market area increased approximately for the year ended december  over the same period in revenue generated from our international market areas increased approximately 
revenue from our gulf of mexico market area decreased approximately due to decreased demand for specialty tubulars and stabilization equipment as a result of the lingering effects of the deepwater drilling moratorium 
the decrease in demand for specialty tubulars was partially offset by an increase in demand for accommodation rentals  which benefited from oil spill cleanup efforts 
cost of services as a percentage of revenue increased as rentals from high margin drill pipe  specialty tubulars and stabilization equipment fell significantly in the gulf of mexico due to the deepwater drilling moratorium 
marine segment our marine segment revenue for the year ended december  decreased from to million 
our cost of services percentage increased to of segment revenue for the year ended december  from in primarily due to increased liftboat inspections and maintenance costs coupled with decreased revenue 
due to the high fixed cost nature of this segment  cost of services does not fluctuate proportionately with revenue 
the fleet s average utilization increased to approximately in from in however  the fleet s average dayrate decreased to approximately  in from  in the average dayrate decreased as several of our larger liftboats were not available for work due to inspections and repairs 
both of our foot class liftboats were out of service for an extended period of time for us coast guard inspections 
additionally  our two completed foot class liftboats returned to service in october and november of after being out of service for repairs since november in december  we also sold one of our foot class liftboats for million and recorded a gain of approximately million 
depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion increased to million for the year ended december  from million in depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion expense related to our subsea and well enhancement segment increased million  or  in from the same period in increases in depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion related to the acquisitions of superior completion services  hallin and the bullwinkle platform  along with and capital expenditures  were offset by the decrease in depreciation and amortization as a result of the million reduction in value of assets related to our us land market area recorded in depreciation and amortization expense increased within our drilling products and services segment by million  or  due to and capital expenditures 
depreciation expense related to the marine segment decreased million  or 
the decrease in depreciation expense in our marine segment is attributable to very low utilization of our larger boats as our foot class liftboats were out of service for an extended period of time for us coast guard inspections and our two completed foot class liftboats returned to service in the october and november of after being out of the service for repairs since november general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million in included in this increase is approximately million of management transition expenses 
additional increases in general and administrative expenses include the acquisitions of superior completion services and hallin  as well as increased bonus and compensation expense due to our improved performance  and additional infrastructure to enhance our growth 

table of contents reduction in value of assets during  we recorded a reduction in the value of assets totaling million in connection with liftboat components primarily related to our two partially completed class liftboats 
after a detailed evaluation  we concluded in december that it was impractical to complete these vessels 
as such  we reduced our carrying value in these assets to their respective net realizable value 
during the second quarter of  we recorded an expense of approximately million in connection with intangible assets within our subsea and well enhancement segment 
this reduction in value of intangible assets was primarily due to the decline in demand for services in the us land market area 
during the fourth quarter of  the us land market area remained depressed and our forecast of this market did not suggest a timely recovery sufficient to support our current carrying values 
as such  we recorded an expense of approximately million related to our tangible assets property  plant and equipment within the same segment 
additionally in  we recorded a million expense to write off our remaining investment in bog  an equity method investment in which we owned a interest 
in april  bog defaulted under its loan agreements due primarily to the impact of production curtailments from hurricanes gustav and ike in and the decline of natural gas and oil prices 
as a result of continued negative bog operating results  lack of viable interested buyers and unsuccessful attempts to renegotiate the terms and conditions of bog s loan agreements  we wrote off the remaining carrying value of our investment in bog 
liquidity and capital resources in the year ended december   we generated net cash from operating activities of million as compared to million in our primary liquidity needs are for working capital and to fund capital expenditures  debt service and acquisitions 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we had cash and cash equivalents of million at december  compared to million at december  in addition  we had restricted cash and cash equivalents of approximately million that was used to partially fund the complete acquisition 
at december   approximately million of our cash balance was held in foreign jurisdictions 
cash balances held in foreign jurisdictions could be repatriated to the united states  however  they would be subject to united states federal income taxes  less applicable foreign tax credits 
the company has not provided united states income tax expense on earnings of its foreign subsidiaries because it expects to reinvest the undistributed earnings indefinitely 
we expect increased liquidity in from complete s cash on hand at the date of acquisition 
in addition  we collected million  exclusive of selling costs  in february from the sale of a derrick barge 
we also expect to collect million  exclusive of working capital and selling costs  from the pending sale of our marine segment in the first quarter of and million late in the first half of in connection with the large scale platform decommissioning project in the gulf of mexico  pending certain regulatory approvals 
these amounts are exclusive of any tax payments related to these transactions 
we spent million of cash on capital expenditures during the year ended december  approximately million was used to expand and maintain our drilling products and services equipment inventory  approximately million was spent on our marine segment and approximately million was used to expand and maintain the asset base of our subsea and well enhancement segment 
at december   we had a million bank revolving credit facility 
any amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility were due on july  at december   we had million outstanding under the bank credit facility with a weighted average interest rate of per annum 
on february   at the time of the complete acquisition  we amended our revolving credit facility to increase the borrowing capacity to million from million  and to include a million term loan 
the maturity date for both the credit facility and the term loan is february   and any amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
table of contents and the term loan are due at maturity 
the principal balance of the term loan is payable in installments of million on the last day of each fiscal quarter  commencing june  at february   we had million outstanding under the bank credit facility with a weighted average interest rate of per annum 
we also had million of letters of credit outstanding  which reduces our borrowing capacity under this credit facility 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at libor plus margins that depend on our leverage ratio 
indebtedness under the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets  including the pledge of the stock of our principal subsidiaries
