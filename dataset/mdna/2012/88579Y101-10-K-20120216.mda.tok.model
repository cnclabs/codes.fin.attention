item a 
risk factors provided below is a cautionary discussion of what we believe to be the most important risk factors applicable to the company 
discussion of these factors is incorporated by reference into and considered an integral part of part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations 
results are impacted by the effects of  and changes in  worldwide economic and capital markets conditions 
the company operates in more than countries and derives approximately two thirds of its revenues from outside the united states 
the company s business is subject to global competition and may be adversely affected by factors in the united states and other countries that are beyond its control  such as disruptions in financial markets  economic downturns in the form of either contained or widespread recessionary conditions  elevated unemployment levels  sluggish or uneven recovery  in specific countries or regions  or in the various industries in which the company operates  social  political or labor conditions in specific countries or regions  natural and other disasters affecting the operations of the company or its customers and suppliers  or adverse changes in the availability and cost of capital  interest rates  tax rates  or regulations in the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
the company s credit ratings are important to m s cost of capital 
the major rating agencies routinely evaluate the company s credit profile and assign debt ratings to m 
the company currently has an aa credit rating  with a stable outlook  from standard poor s and an aa credit rating  with a stable outlook  from moody s investors service 
this evaluation is based on a number of factors  which include financial strength  business and financial risk  
table of contents as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting 
the company s current ratings have served to lower m s borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of lenders 
failure to maintain the current ratings level would adversely affect the company s cost of funds and could adversely affect liquidity and access to capital markets 
the company s results are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences 
demand for the company s products  which impacts revenue and profit margins  is affected by i the development and timing of the introduction of competitive products  ii the company s response to downward pricing to stay competitive  iii changes in customer order patterns  such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes  changes in the company s incentive programs  or the customer s ability to achieve incentive goals  and iv changes in customers preferences for our products  including the success of products offered by our competitors  and changes in customer designs for their products that can affect the demand for some of the company s products 
foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the company s ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and earnings 
because the company s financial statements are denominated in us dollars and approximately two thirds of the company s revenues are derived from outside the united states  the company s results of operations and its ability to realize projected growth rates in sales and earnings could be adversely affected if the us dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies 
the company s growth objectives are largely dependent on the timing and market acceptance of its new product offerings  including its ability to continually renew its pipeline of new products and to bring those products to market 
this ability may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development  such as the inability to identify viable new products  obtain adequate intellectual property protection  or gain market acceptance of new products 
there are no guarantees that new products will prove to be commercially successful 
the company s future results are subject to fluctuations in the costs and availability of purchased components  compounds  raw materials and energy  including oil and natural gas and their derivatives  due to shortages  increased demand  supply interruptions  currency exchange risks  natural disasters and other factors 
the company depends on various components  compounds  raw materials  and energy including oil and natural gas and their derivatives supplied by others for the manufacturing of its products 
it is possible that any of its supplier relationships could be interrupted due to natural and other disasters and other events  or be terminated in the future 
any sustained interruption in the company s receipt of adequate supplies could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  while the company has a process to minimize volatility in component and material pricing  no assurance can be given that the company will be able to successfully manage price fluctuations or that future price fluctuations or shortages will not have a material adverse effect on the company 
acquisitions  strategic alliances  divestitures  and other unusual events resulting from portfolio management actions and other evolving business strategies  and possible organizational restructuring could affect future results 
the company monitors its business portfolio and organizational structure and has made and may continue to make acquisitions  strategic alliances  divestitures and changes to its organizational structure 
with respect to acquisitions  future results will be affected by the company s ability to integrate acquired businesses quickly and obtain the anticipated synergies 
the company s future results may be affected if the company generates fewer productivity improvements than estimated 
the company utilizes various tools  such as lean six sigma  to improve operational efficiency and productivity 
there can be no assurance that all of the projected productivity improvements will be realized 
security breaches and other disruptions to the company s information technology infrastructure could interfere with the company s operations  compromise information belonging to the company and its customers and suppliers  and expose the company to liability which could adversely impact the company s business and reputation 
in the ordinary course of business  the company relies on information technology networks and systems  some of which are managed by third parties  to process  transmit and store electronic information  and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities 
additionally  the company collects and stores sensitive data  including proprietary business information 
despite security measures and business continuity plans  the company s information technology networks and infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage  disruptions or shutdowns due to attack by hackers or breaches  employee error or malfeasance  power outages  computer viruses  telecommunication or utility failures  systems failures  natural disasters or other catastrophic events 
any such events could result in legal claims or proceedings  liability or penalties under privacy laws  disruption in operations  and damage to the company s reputation  which could adversely affect the company s business 

table of contents the company s future results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings and legal compliance risks  including those involving product liability  antitrust  environmental  the us foreign corrupt practices act and other anti bribery  anti corruption  or other matters 
the outcome of these legal proceedings may differ from the company s expectations because the outcomes of litigation  including regulatory matters  are often difficult to reliably predict 
various factors or developments can lead the company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable  or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates  such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment  a significant settlement  significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law 
a future adverse ruling  settlement or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or cash flows in any particular period

critical accounting estimates information regarding significant accounting policies is included in note as stated in note  the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the company believes its most critical accounting estimates relate to legal proceedings  the company s pension and postretirement obligations  asset impairments and income taxes 
senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of m s board of directors 
legal proceedings the categories of claims for which the company has a probable and estimable liability  the amount of its liability accruals  and the estimates of its related insurance receivables are critical accounting estimates related to legal proceedings 
please refer to the section entitled process for disclosure and recording of liabilities and insurance receivables related to legal proceedings contained in legal proceedings in note for additional information about such estimates 
pension and postretirement obligations m has various company sponsored retirement plans covering substantially all us employees and many employees outside the united states 
the us defined benefit pension plan was closed to new participants effective january  the company accounts for its defined benefit pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans in accordance with accounting standard codification asc  compensation retirement benefits  in measuring plan assets and benefit obligations and in determining the amount of net periodic benefit cost 
asc requires employers to recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit pension or postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income  which is a component of stockholders equity 
while the company believes the valuation methods used to determine the fair value of plan assets are appropriate and consistent with other market participants  the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date 
pension benefits associated with these plans are generally based primarily on each participant s years of service  compensation  and age at retirement or termination 
two critical assumptions  the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets  are important elements of expense and liability measurement 
see note for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses 
the company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the december measurement date for its pension and postretirement benefit plans 
the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
the company sets its rate to reflect the yield of a portfolio of high quality  fixed income debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits 
using this methodology  the company determined a discount rate of for us pension and for us postretirement benefits to be appropriate as of december   which represents a decrease from the and rates  respectively  used as of december  the weighted average discount rate for international pension plans as of december  was  a decrease from the rate used as of december  
table of contents a significant element in determining the company s pension expense in accordance with asc is the expected return on plan assets  which is based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes 
for the us pension plan  the expected long term rate of return on an annualized basis for is  a decrease from refer to note for information on how the rate was determined 
return on assets assumptions for international pension and other post retirement benefit plans are calculated on a plan by plan basis using plan asset allocations and expected long term rate of return assumptions 
the weighted average expected return for the international pension plan is for  compared to for for the year ended december   the company recognized total consolidated pre tax pension and postretirement expense after settlements  curtailments and special termination benefits of million  up from million in pension and postretirement expense before settlements  curtailments and special termination benefits is anticipated to increase to approximately million in  an increase of million compared to for the pension plans  holding all other factors constant  a percentage point increase decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would decrease increase pension expense by approximately million for us pension plans and approximately million for international pension plans 
also  holding all other factors constant  a percentage point increase in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities would decrease pension expense by approximately million for us pension plans and approximately million for international pension plans 
in addition  a percentage point decrease in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities would increase pension expense by approximately million for us pension plans and approximately million for international pension plans 
asset impairments as of december   net property  plant and equipment totaled billion and net identifiable intangible assets totaled billion 
management makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which actual results will emerge over long periods of time 
this includes the recoverability of long lived assets employed in the business  including assets of acquired businesses 
these estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant 
for instance  expected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related asset group 
impairments recorded in related to restructuring actions are discussed in note in june  m s security systems division within the safety  security and protection services business segment was notified that the uk government decided to award the production of its passports to a competitor upon the expiration of m s existing uk passport contracts in october as a result of this event  in june  m tested the long lived assets associated with the uk passport activity for recoverability and also reassessed their remaining useful lives 
in addition  m tested goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit security systems division level 
the result of the june test of recoverability of long lived assets associated with the uk passport activity indicated that the asset grouping s carrying amount of approximately million before impairment exceeded the remaining expected cash flows 
accordingly  m recorded a non cash impairment charge of approximately million in the second quarter of to write these assets down to their fair value 
in addition  accelerated depreciation amortization was taken over the period june through the date of expiration of the contract based on a reassessment of the remaining expected useful life of these assets 
m goodwill totaled approximately billion as of december  m s annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the fourth quarter of each year 
impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level  with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit 
reporting units are one level below the business segment level m has six business segments at december   but can be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics 
at m  reporting units generally correspond to a division 
m did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing 
an impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a price earnings ratio for comparable industry groups  or by using a discounted cash flow analysis 
m typically uses the price earnings ratio approach for stable and growing businesses that have a long history and track record of generating positive operating income and cash flows 
m uses the discounted cash flow approach for start up  loss position and declining businesses  but also uses discounted cash flow as an additional tool for businesses that may be growing at a slower rate than planned due to economic or other conditions 

table of contents as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  effective in the first quarter of  m made certain product moves between its business segments 
for those changes that resulted in reporting unit changes  the company applied the relative fair value method to determine the impact to reporting units 
during the first quarter of  the company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by this new structure and determined that no impairment existed 
the discussion that follows relates to the separate fourth quarter annual impairment test and is in the context of the segment structure that existed at that time 
as of september   m had primary reporting units  with ten reporting units accounting for approximately percent of the goodwill 
these ten reporting units were comprised of the following divisions m purification inc  occupational health and environmental safety  optical systems  infection prevention  security systems  m espe  industrial adhesives and tapes  communication markets  abrasive systems and health information systems 
the fair values for m purification inc and optical systems  based on fourth quarter testing  were both in excess of carrying value by approximately percent  while security systems was in excess of carrying value by percent  all with no impairment indicated 
as part of its annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter  m used a weighted average discounted cash flow analysis for these divisions  using projected cash flows that were weighted based on different sales growth and terminal value assumptions  among other factors 
the weighting was based on management s estimates of the likelihood of each scenario occurring 
the fair values for all other significant reporting units were in excess of carrying value by more than percent 
in  m primarily used an industry price earnings ratio approach  but also used a discounted cash flows approach for certain reporting units  to determine fair values 
goodwill is testing for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year 
based on fourth quarter testing  m s estimated fair value when valuing each reporting unit individually would aggregate to approximately billion  implying a control premium of percent when compared to m s market value of approximately billion at september  at december   m s market value was approximately billion  implying a control premium of percent 
the control premium is defined as the sum of the individual reporting units estimated market values compared to m s total company estimated fair value  with the sum of the individual values typically being larger than the value for the total company 
m s market value at both september  and december  was significantly in excess of its equity of approximately billion and billion  respectively 
m is an integrated materials enterprise  thus  many of m s businesses could not easily be sold on a stand alone basis 
based on its annual test in the fourth quarter of  no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting units 
factors which could result in future impairment charges  among others  include changes in worldwide economic conditions  changes in competitive conditions and customer preferences  and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
these risk factors are discussed in item a  risk factors  of this document 
as of december   m had approximately billion of goodwill related to m purification inc  million related to optical systems and million related to security systems 
if future non cash asset impairment charges are taken  m would expect that only a portion of the long lived assets or goodwill would be impaired 
m will continue to monitor its reporting units in for any triggering events or other indicators of impairment 
income taxes the extent of m s operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions 
the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors  including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal  state  and international tax audits 
the company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
the company follows guidance provided by asc  income taxes  regarding uncertainty in income taxes  to record these liabilities refer to note for additional information 
the company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  however  due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the company s current estimate of the tax liabilities 
if the company s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  an additional charge to expense would result 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary

a monte carlo simulation technique was used to test the company s exposure to changes in currency and interest rates and assess the risk of loss or benefit in after tax earnings of financial instruments  derivatives and underlying exposures outstanding at december  the model third party bank dataset used a percent confidence level over a month time horizon 
the model used analyzed currencies  interest rates related to two currencies  and five commodities  but does not purport to represent what actually will be experienced by the company 
this model does not include certain hedge transactions  because the company believes their inclusion would not materially impact the results 
foreign exchange rate risk of loss or benefit increased in  primarily due to increases in exposures  which is one of the key drivers in the valuation model 
interest rate volatility decreased in because interest rates are currently very low and are projected to remain low  based on forward rates 
the following table summarizes the possible adverse and positive impacts to after tax earnings related to these exposures 
adverse impact on positive impact on after tax earnings after tax earnings millions foreign exchange rates interest rates commodity rates the global exposures related to purchased components and materials are such that a percent price change would result in a pre tax cost or savings of approximately million per year
