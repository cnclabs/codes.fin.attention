overview synta pharmaceuticals corp 
is a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering  developing  and commercializing small molecule drugs to extend and enhance the lives of patients with severe medical conditions  including cancer and chronic inflammatory diseases 
we have two drug candidates in clinical trials for treating multiple types of cancer and several drug candidates in the preclinical stage of development 
each of our drug candidates was discovered and developed internally using our proprietary  unique chemical compound library and integrated discovery engine 
we retain full ownership of all of our drug candidates 
we believe that our competitive advantages include the broad clinical and commercial potential of our drug candidates  the strength of our intellectual property portfolio  consisting of over issued and pending patents  our proprietary chemical compound library and the strength of our drug discovery platform  with which we have generated all of our drug candidates  our ability to integrate discovery  translational  and clinical research to optimize our scientific and clinical choices and further strengthen our intellectual property position  our operational experience in effectively managing large scale  global clinical programs  the ownership of our programs  which creates strategic flexibility in partnership discussions that can be used to enhance the value we may ultimately capture from our drug candidates  our strong network of relationships with leading investigators and institutions  which facilitates our ability to conduct clinical trials efficiently  and the skills  talent  and level of industry experience of our employees 
we believe that these competitive advantages provide us with multiple  sustainable growth opportunities 
we were incorporated in march and commenced operations in july since that time  we have been principally engaged in the discovery and development of novel drug candidates 
as of december   we have funded our operations principally with million in net proceeds from private and public offerings of our equity  as well as million in gross proceeds from two term loans  including million from a term loan that was executed in september with general electric capital corporation  or gecc  and one other lender  and million from a term loan that was executed in march with oxford finance corporation  or oxford 
in january and february  we raised approximately million in net proceeds from the sale of an aggregate of  shares of our common stock in a public offering at a public offering price of per share  including  shares in the initial closing in january and  shares in a second closing in february following the full exercise of the over allotment option granted to the underwriters 
in addition to raising capital from financing activities  we have also received substantial capital from partnering activities 
in october  we entered into a global collaborative development  commercialization and license agreement with glaxosmithkline  or gsk  for the joint development and commercialization of elesclomol 
this collaboration was terminated in september in december  we entered into a collaborative license agreement with hoffman la roche  or roche  for our cracm inhibitor program 
this collaboration was terminated effective on february  as of december   we have received million in nonrefundable partnership payments under these agreements with gsk and with roche  including million in upfront payments  million in operational milestones and million in research and development funding 
as of december   these nonrefundable partnership payments together with the net cash proceeds from equity financings  the term loans from gecc and oxford  and the exercise of common stock warrants and options  provided aggregate net cash proceeds of approximately million 
we have also generated funds from government grants  equipment lease financings and investment income 
we are engaged in preliminary partnership discussions for a number of our programs  which may provide us with additional financial resources if consummated 
we have devoted substantially all of our capital resources to the research and development of our drug candidates 
since our inception  we have had no revenues from product sales 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future as we advance our drug candidates from discovery through preclinical development and clinical trials  and seek regulatory approval and eventual commercialization 
we will need to generate significant revenues from product sales to achieve future profitability and may never do so 
oncology programs we have two clinical stage programs and one preclinical stage program in oncology ganetespib hsp inhibitor ganetespib is a potent  synthetic inhibitor of hsp many of the known oncogenic proteins that play major roles in pathogenesis of solid tumor and hematologic malignancies are client proteins of hsp by inhibiting hsp  ganetespib causes the degradation of these client proteins and the subsequent death of cancer cells dependent on these proteins 
ganetespib has shown potent anticancer activity in a broad range of solid and hematologic cancers both in vitro and in vivo  including cancers resistant to targeted agents and chemotherapies 
in clinical trials to date  ganetespib has shown encouraging evidence of clinical activity  including prolonged tumor shrinkage in patients who have progressed after  or failed to respond to  treatment with commonly used drugs for these tumors 
currently  over patients have been treated with ganetespib across all trials 
ganetespib has been well tolerated to date  with no evidence of the serious liver or common ocular toxicities reported with other hsp inhibitors  or the neurotoxicity  bone marrow toxicities  and alopecia characteristic of many chemotherapies 
the most common adverse event reported with ganetespib has been transient  mild or moderate diarrhea  which can be prevented or effectively managed with standard supportive care 
ganetespib mechanism of action ganetespib potently inhibits hsp  a chaperone protein required for the proper folding and activation of other cellular proteins  particularly kinases 
many of these client proteins of hsp such as akt  bcr abl  braf  kit  met  egfr  flt  her  pdgfra  vegfr have been shown to be critical to cancer cell growth  proliferation  and survival and are the targets of clinically validated and approved cancer drugs  such as gleevec  avastin  herceptin  sutent  nexavar  tarceva  and erbitux 
in preclinical studies  inhibiting hsp causes the degradation of multiple client proteins and leads to cancer cell death 
ganetespib preclinical results results published by our scientists and by our academic collaborators over the past several years have established that ganetespib has potent anticancer activity in a broad range of models of solid and hematologic cancers  both in vitro and in vivo  both as a monotherapy and in combination with a number of widely used anti cancer agents 
agents for which we and our academic collaborators have shown synergistic activity in vitro or in vivo in combination with ganetespib include docetaxel  paclitaxel  pemetrexed  gemcitabine  bevacizumab  cytarabine  irinotecan  etoposide  doxorubicin  carboplatin  cisplatin  vincristine  tamoxifen  fulvestrant  temsirolimus  lapatinib  crizotinib  vemurafenib  selumetinib  and bortezomib 
in november  we published results of certain physicochemical properties of ganetespib that are supportive of the safety and activity profiles observed in clinical trials with ganetespib 
results presented at the aacr eortc nci meeting in november demonstrated that common ocular toxicities seen with some hsp inhibitors  but not observed in clinical trials with aag or ganetespib  are associated with physicochemical properties that affect drug distribution to the eye 
results published in molecular cancer therapeutics in december highlighted other physicochemical properties of ganetespib believed to contribute to the improved safety and activity of ganetespib relative to other hsp inhibitors 
these include smaller molecular weight  greater potency  greater lipophilicity  ability of ganetespib to enter the atp binding pocket of hsp in either the open or closed pocket lid conformation  absence of the benzoquinone moiety in ganetespib s molecular structure  and ability of ganetespib to penetrate deep into tumor tissues 
ganetespib clinical trials based on encouraging results reported in in patients with lung and breast cancer treated with ganetespib  three principal company sponsored trials with ganetespib are ongoing or initiating a randomized phase b trial in patients with advanced nsclc  called the galaxy trial ganetespib assessment in lung cancer with docetaxel evaluating ganetespib in combination with docetaxel versus docetaxel alone  a trial in nsclc patients whose tumors have a genetic profile known as the alk gene rearrangement alk  and a trial in her and triple negative breast cancer patients 
preliminary results from the galaxy trial are expected in the second quarter of  and additional results from the galaxy trial together with preliminary results from the alk lung cancer and breast cancer trials are expected in the second half of in addition to the company sponsored trials in lung and breast cancers  additional investigator sponsored  foundation sponsored  and cooperative group sponsored trials with ganetespib are expected to initiate in nsclc in june and july  we presented results from a phase trial of ganetespib administered as a monotherapy in patients with advanced nsclc at the annual meeting of the american society of clinical oncology asco  and the international association for the study of lung cancer iaslc th world conference on lung cancer  respectively 
patients in this trial had failed to respond to  or experienced disease progression following treatment with  numerous prior therapies for lung cancer 
in this trial  as in other trials  ganetespib had a favorable safety profile without the serious hepatic or common ocular toxicities reported with other hsp inhibitors 
encouraging evidence of clinical activity was observed following treatment with ganetespib as a monotherapy  including durable  objective tumor responses in certain patients  as evaluated by standard response evaluation criteria in solid tumors recist 
the disease control rate  using the standard definition of complete response plus partial response plus stable disease  was 
this rate compares favorably with disease control rates observed in trials for approved and experimental agents in a similar broad  pre treated  advanced nsclc patient population 
alk patients results presented at these meetings showed a connection between single agent ganetespib clinical activity and certain tumor genetic profiles 
four of eight patients for whom genetic testing of their tumors indicated an anaplastic lymphoma kinase alk gene rearrangement  called alk patients  experienced confirmed partial responses following treatment with ganetespib a objective response rate  using the standard definition of complete response plus partial response 
these responses have been durable  with the responding patients remaining on therapy an average of months range to months 
six of these eight patients experienced tumor shrinkage in target lesions  and seven of these eight patients achieved disease control for eight weeks or more disease control rate 
these results are encouraging compared to historical results for chemotherapy and other agents in pre treated patients with advanced nsclc  for which objective response rates have been in the range of and median progression free survival times have been in the range of two to three months 
while early and in a small patient population  these results are comparable to results with the direct alk inhibitor crizotinib  which was granted accelerated approval in august by the fda for the treatment of alk nsclc patients 
in a phase trial in alk patients and in a single arm  non randomized phase trial in alk patients  crizotinib demonstrated a and a objective response rate  respectively  by investigator review  and a and objective response rate  respectively  by independent review 
hsp inhibition has been shown to be effective in preclinical models of alk nsclc with a mechanism of action that is complementary  rather than competitive  to the mechanism of action of crizotinib and other direct alk inhibitors 
in addition to the clinical activity seen with ganetespib  activity was also seen with a first generation hsp inhibitor two out of three alk advanced nsclc patients achieved objective tumor responses 
together  these clinical and preclinical results present strong evidence that hsp inhibition is a promising approach for treating alk advanced nsclc patients 
we are now initiating a global clinical trial evaluating monotherapy administration of ganetespib in alk advanced nsclc patients who have not been previously treated with a direct alk inhibitor 
in addition to our monotherapy trial  a number of cancer centers and cooperative groups have approached us with proposals to support trials evaluating ganetespib in combination with other agents in alk advanced nsclc patients 
we expect at least one such combination trial to start in patients with kras mutations an encouraging signal of activity was seen in patients for whom genetic testing of their tumors indicated a kras mutation  a nsclc patient population with limited treatment options 
results presented at asco in showed that of patients with the kras mutation showed shrinkage of target tumor lesions following treatment with single agent ganetespib 
as a result of this observation in our phase trial  activity in patients with a kras mutation was selected to be a co primary endpoint in the ongoing phase b galaxy trial 
galaxy trial cancer treatments are often given in combination in order to maximize benefit to patients 
a challenge with combination therapy is that the added toxicities from combining two or more potent anti cancer agents may not be tolerable  particularly if the toxicity profiles from distinct treatments overlap 
the favorable safety profile seen to date with ganetespib  and the non overlapping toxicities with many standard of care agents  support a broad combination treatment approach 
results to date suggest potential for combining ganetespib and taxanes 
these include a strong scientific rationale based on multiple mechanisms of synergistic anti cancer activity  the consistent synergy effects seen between ganetespib and taxanes in preclinical tumor models  and the encouraging safety profile and signs of activity seen in our phase nsclc trial in those patients who received both ganetespib and docetaxel as well as in our phase combination study of ganetespib and docetaxel 
initial results from our phase combination study were presented at the annual meeting of the european society of medical oncology esmo in september in the second quarter of we initiated the galaxy trial  a phase b trial in patients with advanced nsclc who have received one prior treatment for advanced disease  ie  a second line setting 
the galaxy trial compares treatment with docetaxel alone  which is approved for second line treatment  versus treatment with ganetespib plus docetaxel 
this program is designed to be registration enabling in two stages 
the first stage is an approximately patient phase b portion designed to establish the clinical benefit and safety profile of ganetespib in combination with docetaxel relative to docetaxel alone  and to identify the patient populations  by biomarker or other disease characteristics  that may be most responsive to combination treatment 
the first stage of this program will be used to build the clinical and operational experience needed to optimize the design and execution of the second stage  phase portion 
the phase portion of the program is expected to enroll between to patients 
progression free survival in the intent to treat and in the kras mutation patient populations are co primary endpoints of the first stage of the phase b portion 
interim results are expected to be available in the first half of breast cancer at the san antonio breast cancer conference in december  researchers at mskcc presented results of a phase trial evaluating ganetespib monotherapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer who had been previously treated with multiple lines of chemotherapy or other anti cancer agents 
results showed that of the her patients experienced a confirmed partial response and an additional achieved stable disease 
these results for hsp inhibition in her disease are consistent with results from an earlier phase study of aag  a first generation hsp inhibitor  in patients who had progressed following treatment with one line of herceptin 
in that trial  of patients achieved a partial response and an additional achieved stable disease 
while in the latter study aag was given in combination with trastuzumab  in the former study ganetespib was given as a monotherapy 
together  these studies present strong evidence that hsp inhibition is a promising approach for treating her breast cancer 
results with ganetespib in patients with triple negative breast cancer were also reported in december one of three evaluable tnbc patients in the phase clinical trial experienced significant tumor shrinkage following three doses of ganetespib 
an objective response was also reported in a patient with metastatic tnbc participating in a ganetespib phase trial 
tnbc represents a difficult to treat disease  for which no targeted therapies are currently approved 
these results are encouraging  and suggest that ganetespib is active in tnbc 
memorial sloan kettering cancer center has announced that it will initiate a phase trial evaluating ganetespib in combination with paclitaxel and herceptin in her breast cancer  and ganetespib in combination with paclitaxel in tnbc 
in addition  we are currently initiating a global clinical trial with ganetespib in these two breast cancer patient populations 
additional clinical trials in addition to the clinical trials we plan to initiate or continue in  we expect that a number of ganetespib trials sponsored by third parties  including cooperative groups  foundations  and individual investigators  will initiate in these include the trials to be sponsored by memorial sloan kettering and other cancer centers described above  trials in combination with radiotherapy  a randomized trial in elderly patients with aml evaluating ganetespib in combination with the chemotherapy drug ara c  and a trial in multiple myeloma  both as a single agent and in combination with velcade 
the clinical trial in multiple myeloma is supported by a grant of up to million by the multiple myeloma research foundation 
elesclomol mitochondria targeting agent elesclomol is a first in class  investigational drug candidate that triggers programmed cell death apoptosis  in cancer cells through a novel mechanism disrupting cancer cell mitochondrial metabolism 
in preclinical experiments  anti cancer activity of elesclomol has been shown to correlate with certain biomarkers  including ldh  which can distinguish between active mitochondria sufficient oxygen and inactive mitochondria insufficient oxygen 
consistent with these findings in three randomized clinical trials  ldh was an important predictor of elesclomol treatment outcome 
our current clinical program for elesclomol includes a clinical trial of elesclomol as a monotherapy in aml 
in december  we presented results at the american society for hematology ash meeting showing that elesclomol was highly active against aml cell lines and primary blast cells from aml patients 
in february  we announced that the first patient had been treated in a phase dose escalation study of elesclomol as a single agent in patients with aml 
this trial will enroll up to patients with relapsed or refractory aml and total baseline serum ldh level less than times uln 
patients will be treated with elesclomol sodium on a once weekly schedule at a starting dose of mg m  with dose escalation planned based on safety  tolerability and pharmacokinetic considerations 
the trial is being conducted at princess margaret hospital in toronto  canada and at memorial sloan kettering cancer center in new york 
we are also evaluating the use of elesclomol in combination with paclitaxel in ovarian cancer 
in march  the gynecological oncology group gog  initiated a phase clinical trial of elesclomol in combination with paclitaxel for the treatment of persistent or recurrent ovarian  fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer for patients with total baseline serum ldh level less than times uln 
the gog is a non profit organization with the purpose of promoting excellence in the quality and integrity of clinical and basic scientific research in the field of gynecologic malignancies 
the national cancer institute is providing financial support of up to approximately  for the trial through its cancer therapy evaluation program 
sta vascular disrupting agent sta is a novel  injectable  small molecule compound that appears to disrupt the blood vessels that supply tumors with oxygen and essential nutrients  and is in preclinical development 
in march  we received a million grant from the united states department of defense dod for the development of sta in advanced prostate cancer and initiated work on this study in the second quarter of inflammatory disease programs we have two preclinical stage programs focusing on treatments for inflammatory diseases 
both of our inflammatory disease programs focus on oral  disease modifying drug candidates that act through novel mechanisms and could potentially target multiple indications 
cracm ion channel inhibitors we have developed novel  small molecule inhibitors of cracm ion channels expressed on immune cells 
our cracm ion channel inhibitors have shown strong anti inflammatory activity in preclinical studies both in vitro and in vivo  inhibiting t cell and mast cell activity  including cytokine release  degranulation  and immune cell proliferation 
potential applications include a wide range of inflammatory diseases and disorders for which modulating t cell and mast cell function has been shown to be critical  including ra  asthma  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd  allergy  transplant rejection  and other autoimmune diseases and inflammatory conditions 
we have several promising cracm inhibitors in preclinical development 
because there are a number of cracm ion channel targets on immune cells  we believe that cracm inhibitor compounds can be developed that target different diseases 
roche cracm inhibitor alliance in december  as amended in february  february and july  we formed a strategic alliance with roche to discover  develop  and commercialize small molecule drugs targeting cracm channels  which we refer to as the roche agreement 
the goal of this alliance was to develop a novel category of oral  disease modifying agents for the treatment of ra and other autoimmune diseases and inflammatory conditions 
on november   we received notice from roche of its election to terminate the roche agreement  which termination became effective on february  roche s termination of the agreement falls under the termination for convenience clause of the agreement 
as a result of termination of the roche agreement  the research  development and commercialization licenses granted to roche by us have terminated 
ownership of all rights to all licensed compounds as defined in the agreement including the scientific data relating to those compounds has reverted to us 
we have also received an exclusive license to use roche s patent rights and know how to research  develop  manufacture  commercialize and import any collaboration compound  including the licensed compounds 
we are obligated to pay a low single digit royalty on a country by country and licensed product by licensed product as defined in the agreement basis upon commercialization of any licensed product 
il inhibitors we have identified several small molecule il inhibitors that represent a promising opportunity to develop drug candidates that could be administered orally and potentially address a wide range of serious inflammatory diseases with high unmet medical needs 
financial operations overview revenue we have not yet generated any product revenue and do not expect to generate any product revenue in the foreseeable future  if at all 
our revenues to date have been generated primarily through our former collaboration agreements with gsk and roche 
the terms of these agreements included payment to us of upfront license fees  milestone payments  research and development cost sharing and royalties 
we will seek to generate revenue from product sales and from future collaborative or strategic relationships 
upfront license payments and milestones are recognized ratably as collaboration revenue using the time based model over the estimated performance period and any changes in the estimated performance period could result in substantial changes to the period over which these revenues are recognized 
in the future  we expect any revenue we generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing and amount of payments received and expenses incurred under future collaborations or strategic relationships  and the amount and timing of payments we receive upon the sale of our drug candidates  to the extent any are successfully commercialized 
research and development research and development expense consists of costs incurred in connection with developing and advancing our drug discovery technology and identifying and developing our drug candidates 
we charge all research and development expenses to operations as incurred 
our research and development expense consists of internal costs associated with research  preclinical and clinical activities  payments to third party contract research organizations  investigative sites and consultants in connection with our preclinical and clinical development programs  costs associated with drug formulation and supply of drugs for clinical trials  personnel related expenses  including salaries  stock based compensation  benefits and travel  and overhead expenses  including rent and maintenance of our facilities  and laboratory and other supplies 
we do not know if we will be successful in developing our drug candidates 
we believe that accurately projecting total program specific expenses through commercialization is not possible at this time 
the timing and amount of these expenses will depend upon the costs associated with potential future clinical trials of our drug candidates  and any expansion of our research and development organization  regulatory requirements  advancement of our preclinical programs and product manufacturing costs  many of which cannot be determined with accuracy at this time based on the stage of development of our drug candidates 
this is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the duration and cost of clinical trials  which vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of unanticipated events arising during clinical development  including with respect to the number of clinical sites included in the trial  the length of time required to enroll suitable subjects  the number of subjects that ultimately participate in the trials  and the efficacy and safety results of our clinical trials and the number of additional required clinical trials 
our expenditures are subject to additional uncertainties  including the terms and timing of regulatory approvals and the expense of filing  prosecuting  defending or enforcing any patent claims or other intellectual property rights 
in addition  we may obtain unexpected or unfavorable results from our clinical trials 
we may elect to discontinue  delay or modify clinical trials of some drug candidates or focus on others 
a change in the outcome of any of the foregoing variables in the development of a drug candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that drug candidate 
for example  if the fda or other regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we currently anticipate  or if we experience significant delays in any of our clinical trials  we would be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development 
additionally  future commercial and regulatory factors beyond our control will evolve and therefore impact our clinical development programs and plans over time 
in  we anticipate that the overall costs under our ganetespib program will increase as we further advance clinical development of ganetespib  including the galaxy trial and other clinical trials that we plan to initiate in  as well as the conduct of non clinical supporting activities 
however  this anticipated increase will be offset in part due to the anticipated lower investment in cracm research following the conclusion of the roche agreement in its entirety on february   and the anticipated completion in the first quarter of of the work under the grant by the dod for the development of sta in advanced prostate cancer 
beyond our current lead drug candidates  we anticipate that we will select drug candidates and research projects for further development on an ongoing basis in response to their preclinical and clinical success  as well as commercial potential 
general and administrative general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel in executive  finance  business and commercial development  investor and medical community relations  human resources and administrative functions 
other costs include stock based compensation costs  directors and officers liability insurance premiums  legal costs of pursuing patent protection of our intellectual property  fees for general legal  accounting  public company requirements and compliance  and other professional services  as well as overhead related costs not otherwise included in research and development 
in  we anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will remain at levels similar to restructuring on march   we committed to a restructuring plan that consisted primarily of an immediate workforce reduction of approximately positions  to a total of approximately positions  to align our workforce to our revised operating plans following the suspension of our symmetry clinical trial of elesclomol 
in the first quarter of  we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately million for severance and estimated benefits continuation costs and outplacement services 
the approximate million in restructuring related payments for severance  unused paid time off  benefits and outplacement services was fully paid in to conserve additional capital resources  we did not renew one of our office building leases that expired in august and consolidated our operations within our three other facilities 
we did not incur an impairment charge in connection with the facility consolidation 
critical accounting policies and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods 
we are required to make estimates and judgments with respect to research contract accruals  the recoverability of long lived assets  measurement of stock based compensation and the periods of performance under collaborative research and development agreements 
we base our estimates on historical experience  known trends and events  and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies and estimates are most critical to aid in understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
marketable securities marketable securities consist of investments in high grade corporate obligations  and government and government agency obligations that are classified as available for sale 
since these securities are available to fund current operations they are classified as current assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
we adjust the cost of available for sale debt securities for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity 
we include such amortization and accretion in interest and investment income 
realized gains and losses and declines in value  if any  that we judge to be other than temporary on available for sale securities are reported in interest and investment income 
to determine whether an other than temporary impairment exists  we consider whether we intend to sell the debt security and  if we do not intend to sell the debt security  we consider available evidence to assess whether it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before the recovery of our amortized cost basis 
during the years ended december   and  we determined that no securities were other than temporarily impaired 
marketable securities are stated at fair value  including accrued interest  with their unrealized gains and losses included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss  which is a separate component of stockholders equity 
the fair value of these securities is based on quoted prices and observable inputs 
realized gains and losses are determined on the specific identification method 
during the years ended december   and  we recorded no realized gains or losses on marketable securities 
revenue recognition collaboration and license agreements our principal source of revenue to date has been generated from former collaborative research and development agreements with roche and gsk  which included upfront license payments  development milestones  reimbursement of research and development costs  and potential profit sharing payments  commercialization and sales based milestones and royalties 
the application of accounting rules requires subjective analysis and requires management to make estimates and assumptions about whether deliverables within multiple element arrangements are separable from the other aspects of the contractual arrangement into separate units of accounting and to determine the fair value to be allocated to each unit of accounting 
in october  the financial accounting standards board issued a new accounting standard  asu no 
multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  which amends the guidance on the accounting for arrangements involving the delivery of more than one element 
this standard addresses the determination of the unit s of accounting for multiple element arrangements and how the arrangement s consideration should be allocated to each unit of accounting 
we adopted this new accounting standard on a prospective basis for all multiple element arrangements entered into on or after january  and for any multiple element arrangements that were entered into prior to january  but materially modified on or after january  pursuant to the new standard  each required deliverable is evaluated to determine if it qualifies as a separate unit of accounting 
for us  this determination is generally based on whether the deliverable has stand alone value to the customer 
the arrangement s consideration is then allocated to each separate unit of accounting based on the relative selling price of each deliverable 
the estimated selling price of each deliverable is determined using the following hierarchy of values i vendor specific objective evidence of fair value  ii third party evidence of selling price  and iii management s best estimate of the selling price  or besp 
the besp reflects our best estimate of what the selling price would be if the deliverable was regularly sold by us on a stand alone basis 
we expect  in general  to use besp for allocating consideration to each deliverable 
in general  the consideration allocated to each unit of accounting is then recognized as the related goods or services are delivered limited to the consideration not contingent upon future deliverables 
for multiple element arrangements entered into prior to january  and not materially modified thereafter  we continued to apply our prior accounting policy with respect to such arrangements 
under this policy  in general  revenue from non refundable  upfront fees related to intellectual property rights licenses where we had continuing involvement was recognized ratably over the estimated period of ongoing involvement because there was no objective and reliable evidence of fair value for certain of the undelivered item to allow the delivered item to be considered a separate unit of accounting 
this requirement with respect to the fair value of undelivered items was eliminated in the newly issued accounting standard 
in general  the consideration with respect to the other deliverables was recognized when the goods or services were delivered 
our deliverables under our former collaboration agreements with roche and gsk  including the related rights and obligations  contractual cash flows and performance periods  are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
certain of the deliverables were combined as a single unit of accounting 
the cash flows associated with the single unit of accounting from the research and development portions of our collaborations are recognized as revenue using a time based model 
under this model  cash flow streams are recognized as revenue over the estimated performance period 
upon achievement of milestones  as defined in the collaboration agreements  revenue is recognized to the extent the accumulated service time  if any  has occurred 
the remainder is deferred and recognized as revenue ratably over the remaining estimated performance period 
a change in the period of time expected to complete the deliverable is accounted for as a change in estimate on a prospective basis 
revenue is limited to amounts that are non refundable and that our collaborators are contractually obligated to pay to us 
effective  january   we adopted new accounting guidance which codified a method of revenue recognition that has been common practice 
under this method  contingent consideration from research and development activities that is earned upon the achievement of a substantive milestone is recognized in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved 
at the inception of each arrangement that includes milestone payments  we evaluate whether each milestone is substantive 
this evaluation includes an assessment of whether a the consideration is commensurate with either the entity s performance to achieve the milestone  or the enhancement of the value of the delivered item s as a result of a specific outcome resulting from the entity s performance to achieve the milestone  b the consideration relates solely to past performance and c the consideration is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement 
we evaluate factors such as the scientific  clinical  regulatory  commercial and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the respective milestone  the level of effort and investment required and whether the milestone consideration is reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement in making this assessment 
from the effective date of the adoption of this standard  we did not achieve any developmental  commercial or sales based milestones pursuant to our research and collaboration agreement with roche 
upon the effectiveness of the termination of the collaboration agreement with roche on february   as more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements  we have no ongoing research and collaboration agreements under which milestones may be achieved 
royalty revenues are based upon a percentage of net sales 
royalties from the sales of products will be recorded on the accrual basis when results are reliably measurable  collectibility is reasonably assured and all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
sales milestones  which are based upon the achievement of certain agreed upon sales thresholds  will be recognized in the period in which the respective sales threshold is achieved and collectibility is reasonably assured 
accrued expenses and accrued contract research liabilities as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying services which have been performed on our behalf  and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements 
given our current business  the primary area of uncertainty concerning accruals which could have a material effect on our business is with respect to service fees paid to contract manufacturers in conjunction with the production of clinical drug supplies and to contract research organizations in connection with our preclinical studies and clinical trials 
in connection with all of the foregoing service fees  our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status and timing of services provided 
the majority of our service providers  including contract research organizations  invoice us in arrears for services performed 
in the event that we do not identify some costs which have begun to be incurred  or we under or over estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services in a given period  our reported expenses for such period would be understated or overstated 
we currently reflect the over or under accrual of expenses directly in our operations in the period the amount was determined 
our arrangements with contract research organizations in connection with clinical trials often provide for payment prior to commencing the project or based upon predetermined milestones throughout the period during which services are expected to be performed 
we recognize expense relating to these arrangements based on the various services provided over the estimated time to completion 
the date on which services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date  and the cost of such services are often determined based on subjective judgments 
we make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us based on the terms of the contract and our ongoing monitoring of service performance 
in the years ended december   and  respectively  we had arrangements with multiple contract research organizations whereby these organizations commit to performing services for us over multiple reporting periods 
we currently recognize and plan to continue to recognize the expenses associated with these arrangements based on our expectation of the timing of the performance of components under these arrangements by these organizations 
generally  these components consist of the costs of setting up the trial  monitoring the trial  closing the trial and preparing the resulting data 
costs related to patient enrollment in clinical trials are accrued as patients are enrolled in the trial 
with respect to financial reporting periods presented in this annual report on form k  and based on our receipt of invoices from our third party providers  the timing of our actual costs incurred have not differed materially from our estimated timing of such costs 
in light of the foregoing  we do not believe our estimates of future expenses and our practice of making judgments concerning the accrual of expenses are reasonably likely to change in the future 
there were no changes in our estimates and accruals for contract service fees that had a material effect on our net income loss for the years ended december   and  respectively 
stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation expense based on the fair value of stock options granted to employees  officers and directors 
we use the black scholes option pricing model as it is the most appropriate valuation method for our option grants 
the black scholes model requires inputs for risk free interest rate  dividend yield  volatility and expected lives of the options 
since we have a limited history of stock activity  expected volatility for the period from april  through december  was based upon the weighted average historical volatility data of our common stock and the historical volatility data from several guideline public biotechnology companies similar in size and value to us that also have stock compensation plans with similar terms 
we use our historical volatility combined with other similar public entity volatility information 
we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical data 
based on an analysis of historical forfeitures  we have applied a forfeiture rate of to all options that vest upon completion of the first year of service following the date of grant 
the analysis is re evaluated at least annually and the forfeiture rate is adjusted as necessary 
the risk free rate for periods within the expected life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant 
the expected lives for options granted represent the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
we use the simplified method for determining the expected lives of options 
for awards with graded vesting  we allocate compensation costs on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
we amortize the fair value of each option over each option s service period  which is generally the vesting period 
our net income loss included compensation costs in the amount of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  and no income tax benefit related to our stock based compensation arrangements for employee and non employee awards 
as of december   the total amount of unrecognized stock based compensation expense was million  which will be recognized over a weighted average period of years

in december  as amended in february  february and july  we entered into a collaborative license agreement with roche to discover  develop  and commercialize small molecule drugs targeting cracm channels and received a million nonrefundable upfront payment from roche in january reimbursements of research and development costs to us by roche were recorded as cost sharing revenue in the period in which the related research and development costs were incurred 
the initial two year research term concluded on december  on november   the company received written notice of roche s election to terminate the roche agreement  which termination became effective on february  see notes and in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in as compared to  license and milestone revenue under the roche agreement increased by million 
in the fourth quarter of  upon notification of roche s election to terminate the roche agreement  we accelerated the recognition of approximately million of remaining deferred revenue from the upfront payment because we had no remaining significant performance obligations 
in as compared to  cost sharing reimbursements from roche decreased by million as the initial two year research term under the roche agreement concluded on december  in as compared to  cost sharing reimbursements from roche decreased by million due to the realignment of our resources to focus on advancing the research program  thereby shifting preclinical and clinical development to roche  as well as a corresponding lower level of research and development funding by roche 
gsk overview in october  as amended in june  we entered into a collaborative development  commercialization and license agreement with gsk for elesclomol  received an million nonrefundable upfront payment from gsk and achieved a total of million in nonrefundable operational milestones

in as compared to  no revenue related to gsk was recognized due to the termination of the gsk agreement in september in the third quarter of  upon the effectiveness of the termination of the gsk agreement  we recognized approximately million of remaining deferred revenue from upfront payments and milestones  all of which were recorded as license and milestone revenue as we had no further obligation for deliverables under the gsk agreement 
also  in  cost sharing reimbursements related to the gsk agreement increased by million 
the requirement to pay the cumulative gsk cost sharing reimbursements did not survive termination of the gsk agreement and in the third quarter of  upon the effectiveness of the termination of the gsk agreement  we reversed approximately million of cost sharing reimbursement liabilities as collaboration revenue 
grant revenue in as compared to  grant revenue decreased by million 
in march  we received a grant from the dod in the approximate amount of million  for the development of sta in advanced prostate cancer 
we initiated work on this study upon the commencement of the grant period in april reimbursements are based on actual costs agreed upon in the proposal salary  fringe benefits  overhead  and direct costs such as materials and subcontractors 
in  we recognized  of grant revenue under this grant 
the remaining work under this grant is anticipated to be completed in the first quarter of in  we recognized grant revenue of million as compared to no grant revenue recognition in in november  we were informed that all four therapeutic discovery tax credit applications we submitted under the patient protection and affordable care act  as amended by the health care and education affordability reconciliation act  had been approved and that we had been awarded approximately million in grants

costs incurred in connection with the galaxy trial that was initiated in the second quarter of  and the conduct of investigator sponsored studies and supporting non clinical activities were offset  in part  by lower costs in several company sponsored clinical trials that were completed in we anticipate that the overall costs under our ganetespib program will increase in as we further advance clinical development  including the galaxy trial and other clinical trials that we plan to initiate in  as well as the conduct of non clinical supporting activities 
in as compared to  costs incurred under our ganetespib program increased by million  principally including increases of million for personnel related costs  related research supplies  operational overhead and stock compensation  and million for external costs 
these increases were principally due to the advancement of clinical development  including fifteen ongoing clinical trials as of december   the manufacture of supporting drug supply  and the evaluation of additional cancer types and planning activities in connection with future clinical trials 
in  we initiated nine clinical trials  including a phase company sponsored clinical trial of ganetespib in combination with docetaxel in solid tumors and eight investigator sponsored clinical trials  which include a phase trial in hepatic cancer and seven phase trials in colon  gastric  ocular melanoma  pancreatic  prostate  breast and small cell lung cancers

elesclomol in as compared to  costs incurred under our elesclomol program increased by million  including increases of million for personnel related costs  related research supplies  operational overhead and stock compensation  and million for external costs 
these increases were principally related to the commencement of patient enrollment in two clinical trials that were initiated in the fourth quarter of  including a phase clinical trial of elesclomol in combination with paclitaxel in ovarian cancer that is being conducted by the gog and a phase clinical trial of elesclomol as a single agent in aml  as well as supporting clinical drug supply

these decreases were principally due to non recurring costs incurred in resulting from the suspension of our previous elesclomol program and subsequent restructuring in the first quarter of  offset in part by efforts in support of the restart of clinical development 
in the fourth quarter of  we initiated a phase clinical trial of elesclomol in combination with paclitaxel in ovarian cancer that is being conducted by the gog and a phase clinical trial of elesclomol as a single agent in aml 
apilimod in as compared to  costs incurred under our apilimod program decreased by million principally due to decreases of million for personnel related costs  related research supplies  operational overhead and stock compensation  and million for external costs 
based on our review of the results of a phase a clinical trial of apilimod in patients with ra  we do not expect to continue development of apilimod in this indication  with this formulation and route of administration 
cracm in as compared to  costs incurred under our cracm program decreased by million  including decreases of million for personnel related costs  related research supplies  operational overhead and stock compensation  and million for external costs 
these decreases are the result of a lower investment in cracm research following the conclusion on december  of the two year research term under the roche agreement 
in  we anticipate that costs under the cracm program will decrease as the result of a lower investment in cracm research following the conclusion of the roche agreement in its entirety on february  in as compared to  costs incurred under our cracm program decreased by million  principally including decreases of million for personnel related costs  related research supplies  operational overhead and stock compensation  and million for external costs 
these decreases reflect the realignment of our resources to focus on advancing the research program  thereby shifting preclinical and clinical development to roche  as well as a corresponding lower level of research and development funding by roche 
sta in as compared to  costs incurred under our sta program increased by million  including increases of million for personnel related costs  related research supplies  operational overhead and stock compensation  and million for external costs

to date  no shares have been sold to azimuth under the facility 
liquidity funding requirements we expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses and capital expenditures and anticipate that our expenses and losses may increase substantially in the foreseeable future as we complete the ongoing clinical trials of ganetespib in solid tumors  including the galaxy trial and other trials that we plan to initiate in  and hematologic cancers and initiate additional clinical trials of ganetespib if supported by trial results  complete preclinical development of an additional hsp inhibitor and initiate clinical trials of this compound  if supported by the preclinical data  complete the ongoing clinical trials of elesclomol in aml and ovarian cancers  and initiate additional clinical trials of elesclomol  if supported by trial results  complete preclinical development of sta and initiate clinical trials  if supported by preclinical data  advance our cracm inhibitor into preclinical development and initiate clinical trials  if supported by preclinical data  discover  develop  and seek regulatory approval for backups of our current drug candidates and other new drug candidates  identify additional compounds or drug candidates and acquire rights from third parties to those compounds or drug candidates through licenses  acquisitions or other means  and commercialize any approved drug candidates 
our funding requirements will depend on a number of factors  including the progress and results of our ongoing clinical trials of ganetespib and elesclomol  and any additional clinical trials we may initiate in the future based on the results of these clinical trials  the results of our preclinical studies of any additional hsp inhibitors we may develop  our cracm inhibitor and sta  and our decision to initiate clinical trials  if supported by the preclinical and other test results  uncertainty associated with costs  timing  and outcome of regulatory review of our drug candidates  the scope  progress  results  and cost of preclinical development  clinical trials  and regulatory review of any new drug candidates we may discover or acquire  the costs of preparing  filing  and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining  enforcing  and defending intellectual property related claims  our ability to establish additional strategic collaborations and licensing or other arrangements on terms favorable to us  the costs to satisfy our obligations under potential future collaborations  and the timing  receipt  and amount of sales or royalties  if any  from ganetespib  elesclomol  sta  our cracm inhibitors  our il inhibitors and our other potential products 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  a decrease of million from million as of december  this decrease principally reflects our cash used in operations as discussed under cash flows above  partially offset by the million in net proceeds from the sale of  shares of our common stock in an issuer directed registered direct offering in april and million in gross proceeds from the oxford term loan that was executed in march we do not anticipate that we will generate product revenue in the foreseeable future  if at all 
we expect our continuing operations to use cash over the next several years and such cash use may increase significantly from year to year 
while we are engaged in multiple preliminary partnership discussions for each of our currently unpartnered programs  including ganetespib  elesclomol  sta  cracm  and our il inhibitors  which could result in one or more new partnership agreements that may include upfront payments and cost sharing provisions  there is no guarantee we will be successful in entering into any such partnership agreements on commercially reasonable terms  if at all  or that we will receive any other revenue through these partnership efforts in the future 
based on our current operating levels  we expect our cash resources  including the million in net proceeds raised in the january and february public offering  will be sufficient to fund operations into the first half of this estimate assumes that certain activities contemplated for will be conducted subject to the availability of sufficient financial resources 
we continue to evaluate additional potential sources of funding  including partnership agreements  cost or risk sharing arrangements  equity financings or other sources 
we may require significant additional funds earlier than we currently expect in order to conduct additional clinical trials and conduct additional preclinical and discovery activities 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our drug candidates  we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated clinical trials 
to the extent our capital resources are insufficient to meet our future capital requirements  we will need to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity offerings  collaboration agreements  debt financings or licensing arrangements 
however  the credit markets and the financial services industry have recently been experiencing a period of turmoil and uncertainty that have made equity and debt financing more difficult to obtain 
additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
in addition  the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders 
for example  if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities or by selling convertible debt securities  further dilution to our existing stockholders may result 
if we raise funds through collaboration agreements or licensing arrangements  we may be required to relinquish rights to our technologies or drug candidates  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to terminate  significantly modify or delay our research and development programs  reduce our planned commercialization efforts  or obtain funds through collaborators that may require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or drug candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently 
conversely  we may elect to raise additional funds even before we need them if the conditions for raising capital are favorable  including through offerings of securities pursuant to our shelf registration statement on form s  under which we currently have up to million in securities available for issuance  including up to million in shares of common stock that we may offer and sell under the eloc with azimuth until its expiration on may  recent accounting pronouncements refer to note  summary of significant accounting polices  in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities 
tax loss carryforwards for tax years through  we performed analyses to determine if there were changes in ownership  as defined by section of the internal revenue code that would limit our ability to utilize certain net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we determined that we experienced a change in ownership  as defined by section  in connection with the acquisition of principia associates  inc on september   but did not experience a change in ownership upon the effectiveness of our ipo or any other equity offerings to date 
as a result  the utilization of our federal tax net operating loss carryforwards generated prior to the ownership change is limited 
as of december  we have net operating loss carryforwards for us federal tax purposes of approximately million  after taking into consideration net operating losses expected to expire unused as a result of this limitation  and the remainder will expire in varying amounts through unless utilized 
in addition  as of december   we have state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  which will expire through unless utilized 
the utilization of these net operating loss carryforwards may be further limited as we experience future ownership changes as defined in section of the internal revenue code

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million consisting of cash deposited in a highly rated financial institution in the united states and in a short term us treasury money market fund  as well as high grade commercial paper and government agency securities 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital for the purpose of funding operations and we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
we believe that we did not have material exposure to high risk investments such as mortgage backed securities  auction rate securities or other special investment vehicles within our money market fund investments 
we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in fair value as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates  however  would reduce future investment income 
capital market risk 
we currently have no product revenues and depend on funds raised through other sources 
one possible source of funding is through further equity offerings 
our ability to raise funds in this manner depends upon capital market forces affecting our stock price
