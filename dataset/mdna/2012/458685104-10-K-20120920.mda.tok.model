seasonality the hotel s operations historically have been seasonal

these seasonal patterns can be expected to cause fluctuations in the quarterly revenues from the hotel 
competition hotel the hotel industry is highly competitive 
competition is based on a number of factors  most notably convenience of location  brand affiliation  price  range of services and guest amenities or accommodations offered and quality of customer service 
competition is often specific to the individual market in which properties are located 
the hotel is located in an area of intense competition from other hotels in the financial district and san francisco in general 
the hotel is somewhat limited by having only  square feet of meeting room space 
other hotels  with greater meeting room space  may have a competitive advantage by being able to attract larger groups and small conventions 
increased competition from new hotels  or hotels that have been recently undergone substantial renovation  could have an adverse effect on occupancy  average daily rate adr and room revenue per available room revpar and put pressure on the partnership to make additional capital improvements to the hotel to keep pace with the competition 
the hotel s target market is business travelers  leisure customers and tourists  and small to medium size groups 
since the hotel operates in an upper scale segment of the market  we also face increased competition from providers of less expensive accommodations  such as limited service hotels  during periods of economic downturn when leisure and business travelers become more sensitive to room rates 
like other hotels  we have experienced some decrease in some higher rated corporate and business travel as many companies have cut their travel and entertainment budgets in response to economic conditions 
as a result  there could be added pressure on all hotels in the san francisco market to lower room rates in an effort to maintain occupancy levels during such periods 
although we have seen some signs of recovery in the san francisco market during the fiscal year  like all hotels  we will remain subject to the uncertain domestic and global economic environment 
in this highly competitive market  we continue with our efforts to upgrade our guest rooms and facilities and explore new and innovative ways to differentiate the hotel from its competition 
during fiscal  we completed several projects to enhance the guest experience  including our new executive lounge on the th floor of the hotel and the upgrading of the lobby and common areas of the hotel 
we have also made improvements to our restaurant facilities and food and beverage services and have upgraded internet connectivity throughout the hotel and are providing more technological amenities for our guests 
we continue to make the hotel more energy efficient and have enhanced our recycling program to support the concept of a greener world while reducing our operating costs 
the hotel also became a groundbreaker in implementing hilton s huanying welcome program which features a tailored experience for chinese travelers 
we have also taken important steps to further develop our ties to the local chinese community and the city as part of being a good corporate citizen and to promote new business 
moving forward  we will continue to focus on cultivating more international business  especially from china  and capturing a greater percentage of the higher rated business  leisure and group travel 
during the last twelve months  we have seen improvement in business and leisure travel 
if that trend in the san francisco market and the hotel industry continues  it should translate into an increase in room revenues and profitability 
however  like all hotels  it will remain subject to the uncertain domestic and global economic environment 
the hotel is also subject to certain operating risks common to all of the hotel industry  which could adversely impact performance 
these risks include competition for guests and meetings from other hotels including competition and pricing pressure from internet wholesalers and distributors  increases in operating costs  including wages  benefits  insurance  property taxes and energy  due to inflation and other factors  which may not be offset in the future by increased room rates  labor strikes  disruptions or lock outs  dependence on demand from business and leisure travelers  which may fluctuate and is seasonal  increases in energy costs  cost of fuel  airline fares and other expenses related to travel  which may negatively affect traveling  terrorism  terrorism alerts and warnings  wars and other military actions  pandemics or other medical events or warnings which may result in decreases in business and leisure travel  and adverse effects of downturns and recessionary conditions in international  national and or local economies and market conditions 
competition rental properties the ownership  operation and leasing of multifamily rental properties are highly competitive 
the company competes with domestic and foreign financial institutions  other reits  life insurance companies  pension trusts  trust funds  partnerships and individual investors 
in addition  the company competes for tenants in markets primarily on the basis of property location  rent charged  services provided and the design and condition of improvements 
the company also competes with other quality apartment owned by public and private companies 
the number of competitive multifamily properties in a particular market could adversely affect the company s ability to lease its multifamily properties  as well as the rents it is able to charge 
in addition  other forms of residential properties  including single family housing and town homes  provide housing alternatives to potential residents of quality apartment communities or potential purchasers of for sale condominium units 
the company competes for residents in its apartment communities based on resident service and amenity offerings and the desirability of the company s locations 
resident leases at the company s apartment communities are priced competitively based on market conditions  supply and demand characteristics  and the quality and resident service offerings of its communities 
environmental matters in connection with the ownership of the hotel  the company is subject to various federal  state and local laws  ordinances and regulations relating to environmental protection 
under these laws  a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on  under or in such property 
such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of hazardous or toxic substances 
environmental consultants retained by the partnership or its lenders conducted updated phase i environmental site assessments in fiscal year ended june  on the hotel property 
these phase i assessments relied  in part  on phase i environmental assessments prepared in connection with the partnership s first mortgage loan obtained in july phase i assessments are designed to evaluate the potential for environmental contamination on properties based generally upon site inspections  facility personnel interviews  historical information and certain publicly available databases  however  phase i assessments will not necessarily reveal the existence or extent of all environmental conditions  liabilities or compliance concerns at the properties 
although the phase i assessments and other environmental reports we have reviewed disclose certain conditions on our properties and the use of hazardous substances in operation and maintenance activities that could pose a risk of environmental contamination or liability  we are not aware of any environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the company believes that the hotel and its rental properties are in compliance  in all material respects  with all federal  state and local environmental ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances and other environmental matters  the violation of which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company has not received written notice from any governmental authority of any material noncompliance  liability or claim relating to hazardous or toxic substances or other environmental matters in connection with any of its present properties

fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  the company had net loss of  for the year ended june  compared to net income of  for the year ended june  the significant change is primarily attributable to the recording of an unrealized gain of  in fiscal related to the preferred stock of comstock received by the company in exchange for debt as part of the debt restructuring  losses from investing activities in the current year  partially offset by a significant improvement in hotel operations and an improvement in real estate operations 
the company had net income from hotel operations of  for the fiscal year ended june   compared to net income of  for the fiscal year ended june  the significant increase in net income from hotel operations is primarily attributable to a  increase in room revenues and a  decrease in depreciation and amortization expense as many of the furniture and fixture improvements from the renovation of the hotel reached full deprecation during fiscal the following table sets forth a more detailed presentation of hotel operations for the years ended june  and for the years ended june  hotel revenues hotel rooms   food and beverage   garage   other operating departments   total hotel revenues   operating expenses excluding interest  depreciation and amortization operating income before interest  depreciation and amortization interest   depreciation and amortization   net income from hotel operations   for the fiscal year ended june   the hotel generated operating income of  before interest  depreciation and amortization  on total operating revenues of  compared to operating income of  before interest  depreciation and amortization  on operating revenues of  for the fiscal year ended june  the increase in income from hotel operations is primarily attributable to increases in room  food and beverage  and other revenues in the current year  partially offset by an increase in operating expenses due to higher labor costs and increased staffing to improve guest satisfaction as well as greater franchise and management fees which are based on a percentage of revenues 
room revenues increased by  for the fiscal year ended june  compared to the fiscal year ended june  and food and beverage revenues increased by  for the same period 
the increase in room revenues was primarily attributable to a significant increase in average daily room rates during fiscal as the hotel continued to see an increase in higher rated leisure  corporate and group business travel  which also resulted in higher in food and beverage revenues 
the following table sets forth the average daily room rate  average occupancy percentage and room revenue per available room revpar of the hotel for the fiscal years ended june  and fiscal year ended june  average daily rate average occupancy revpar the operations of the hotel experienced an increase in the higher rated business  leisure and group travel segments in the fiscal as the hospitality industry in the san francisco market continued to show signs of recovery 
as a result  the hotel s average daily rate increased significantly by for the fiscal year ended june  compared to the fiscal year ended june  the increase in occupancy of was due to continued increased demand for hotel rooms in san francisco and the hotel s ability to capture a greater share of those rooms within its market set 
due to that increased demand  the hotel was able to reduce the amount of discounted internet business that it was forced to take in prior years to maintain occupancy in a very competitive market and recessionary economic conditions 
as a result  the hotel was able to achieve a revpar number that was higher than fiscal during the past couple of years  we have seen our management team guide our hotel through a difficult economic period by taking bold steps to reduce expenses and implement innovative strategies in order to improve operations and enhance our competitiveness in the market 
as a result  we were well positioned to take advantage of the gradual recovery that took place in the san francisco market 
we saw a significant improvement in room rates as the hotel was able to expand its share of the higher rated business and leisure travel which increased our operating revenues and profitability 
those results made it possible for justice investors to declare its first limited partnership distribution since september as the partnership made a total distribution in the amount of  in december  of which portsmouth received  the general partners of justice will continue to monitor and review the operations and financial results of the hotel and to set the amount of any future distributions that may be appropriate based on operating results  cash flows and other factors  including establishment of reasonable reserves for debt payments and operating contingencies 
we will continue in our efforts to upgrade our guest rooms and facilities and explore new and innovative ways to differentiate the hotel from its competition 
during fiscal  we completed several projects to enhance the guest experience  including our new executive lounge on the th floor of the hotel and the upgrading of the lobby and common areas of the hotel 
we have also made improvements to our restaurant facilities and food and beverage services and have upgraded internet connectivity throughout the hotel and are providing more technological amenities for our guests 
we continue to make the hotel more energy efficient and have enhanced our recycling program to support the concept of a greener world while reducing our operating costs 
the hotel also became a groundbreaker in implementing hilton s huanying welcome program which features a tailored experience for chinese travelers 
we have also taken important steps to further develop our ties to the local chinese community and the city as part of being a good corporate citizen and to promote new business 
moving forward  we will continue to focus on cultivating more international business  especially from china  and capturing a greater percentage of the higher rated business  leisure and group travel 
during the last twelve months  we have seen improvement in business and leisure travel 
if that trend in the san francisco market and the hotel industry continues  it should translate into an increase in room revenues and profitability 
however  like all hotels  it will remain subject to the uncertain domestic and global economic environment 
while operating in a competitive rental market  real estate operations improved modestly 
the company had real estate revenues of  for the year ended june  compared with revenues of  for the year ended june  the increase in rental revenues occurred primarily in the properties located outside of california  particularly in texas  while the california properties remained relatively consistent with the exception of the new california property purchased in april  where the company had rental revenues for full year during fiscal versus only two months in fiscal real estate operating expenses increased to  from  as the result of the increase in occupancy and rental revenue and partially as result of having a full year of expenses related to the new property purchased in april depreciation expense related to the company s real estate operations decreased by approximately  from the prior comparable year primarily as the result of a one time depreciation expense catch up adjustment of  recorded in fiscal due to the reclass of the company s held for sale property from discontinued operations to continuing operations 
management continues to review and analyze the company s real estate operations to improve occupancy and rental rates and to reduce expenses and improve efficiencies 
in january  the company sold its unit apartment complex located in los angeles  california for  the company realized a gain on the sale of real estate of approximately  and received net proceeds of  from the sale after selling costs

however  the amount of gain or loss on marketable securities and other investments for any given period may have no predictive value and variations in amount from period to period may have no analytical value 
for a more detailed description of the composition of the company s marketable securities please see the marketable securities section below 
during the year ended june   the company had an unrealized loss of  related to other investments compared to an unrealized gain of  for the year ended june  the significant difference is due to an unrealized gain of  related to the company s comstock investment in the prior comparable year 
comstock had undergone a restructuring which resulted in the unrealized gain for the company 
during the years ended june  and  the company performed an impairment analysis of its other investments and determined that one of its investments had other than temporary impairment and recorded impairment losses of  and  for each respective period 
dividend and interest income decreased to  for the year ended june  from  for the year ended june  primarily as the result of the decreased investment in income yielding instruments 
the company and its subsidiaries  portsmouth and santa fe  compute and file income tax returns and prepare discrete income tax provisions for financial reporting 
since portsmouth consolidates justice hotel for financial reporting purposes and is not taxed on its non controlling interest in the hotel  variability in the tax provision results from the relative significance of the non controlling interest and the magnitude of the pretax income or loss at the company and its two principal subsidiaries

following the temporary suspension of operations in may for major renovations  the hotel started  and continues  to generate positive cash flows from its operations 
as a result  justice was able to pay some limited partnership distributions in fiscal years and however  due to the significant downturn in the san francisco hotel market beginning in september and the continued weakness in domestic and international economies  no partnership distributions were paid in fiscal and during such periods  the company had to depend more on the revenues generated from the investment of its cash and marketable securities and from its general partner management fees 
since we have seen significant improvement in the operations of the hotel  and the san francisco market in general  justice was in a position to pay a limited partnership distribution in december in an aggregate amount of  of which portsmouth received  the general partners of justice will continue to monitor and review the operations and financial results of the hotel and to set the amount of any future distributions that may be appropriate based on operating results  cash flows and other factors  including establishment of reasonable reserves for debt payments and operating contingencies 
the new justice compensation agreement that became effective on december   when portsmouth assumed the role of managing general partner of justice  has provided additional cash flows to the company 
under the new compensation agreement  portsmouth is now entitled to of the minimum base fee to be paid to the general partners of  while under the prior agreement portsmouth was entitled to receive only of the minimum base fee 
as a result of increases in hotel gross revenues in fiscal  total general partner fees paid to portsmouth for the year ended june  increased to  compared to  for the year ended june  to meet its substantial financial commitments for the renovation and transition of the hotel to a hilton  justice had to rely on borrowings to meet its obligations 
on july   justice entered into a first mortgage loan with the prudential insurance company of america in a principal amount of  the prudential loan 
the term of the prudential loan is for months at a fixed interest rate of per annum 
the prudential loan calls for monthly installments of principal and interest in the amount of approximately  calculated on a year amortization schedule 
the loan is collateralized by a first deed of trust on the partnership s hotel property  including all improvements and personal property thereon and an assignment of all present and future leases and rents 
the prudential loan is without recourse to the limited and general partners of justice 
the principal balance of the prudential loan was  as of june  on march   justice entered into a second mortgage loan with prudential the second prudential loan in a principal amount of  the term of the second prudential loan is for months and matures on august   the same date as the first prudential loan 
the second prudential loan is at a fixed interest rate of per annum and calls for monthly installments of principal and interest in the amount of  calculated on a year amortization schedule 
the second prudential loan is collateralized by a second deed of trust on the partnership s hotel property  including all improvements and personal property thereon and an assignment of all present and future leases and rents 
the second prudential loan is also without recourse to the limited and general partners of justice 
the principal balance of the second prudential loan was  as of june  effective april   the partnership obtained a modification of its  unsecured revolving line of credit facility with east west bank that was to mature on april   and converted that line of credit facility to an unsecured term loan 
the modification provides that justice will pay the  balance on its line of credit facility over a period of four years  to mature on april  this term loan calls for monthly principal and interest payments of  calculated on a nine year amortization schedule  with interest only from may  to august  pursuant to the modification  the annual floating interest rate was reduced by to the wall street journal prime rate plus with a minimum floor rate of per annum 
the modification provides for new financial covenants that include specific financial ratios and a return to minimum profitability after june  management believes that the partnership has the ability to meet the specific covenants and the partnership was in compliance with the covenants as of june  as of june   the interest rate was and the outstanding balance was  despite an uncertain economy  the hotel has continued to generate positive cash flows 
while the debt service requirements related to the two prudential loans  as well as the term loan to pay off the line of credit  may create some additional risk for the company and its ability to generate cash flows in the future  management believes that cash flows from the operations of the hotel and the garage will continue to be sufficient to meet all of the partnership s current and future obligations and financial requirements 
management also believes that there is sufficient equity in the hotel assets to support future borrowings  if necessary  to fund any new capital improvements and other requirements

impact of inflation hotel room rates are typically impacted by supply and demand factors  not inflation  since rental of a hotel room is usually for a limited number of nights 
room rates can be  and usually are  adjusted to account for inflationary cost increases 
since prism has the power and ability under the terms of its management agreement to adjust hotel room rates on an ongoing basis  there should be minimal impact on partnership revenues due to inflation 
partnership revenues are also subject to interest rate risks  which may be influenced by inflation 
for the two most recent fiscal years  the impact of inflation on the company s income is not viewed by management as material 
the company s residential rental properties provide income from short term operating leases and no lease extends beyond one year
