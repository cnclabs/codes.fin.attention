item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading molecular diagnostic company dedicated to making a difference in patient s lives through the discovery and commercialization of transformative tests which assess a person s risk of developing disease  guide treatment decisions and assess risk of disease progression and recurrence 
we believe in improving the healthcare experience for patients and physicians by providing them with critical information to solve unmet clinical needs 
by understanding the underlying genetic basis of disease  we believe that individuals who have a greater risk of developing disease can be identified and physicians may be able to use this information to improve patient outcomes and better manage patient healthcare 
in addition  by understanding the rna expression levels of certain genes  we believe that we can improve patient healthcare by providing information on the aggressiveness of their disease 
further  we have tests in development which analyze the expression of groups of proteins 
we think this protein information will help diagnose and determine treatment for many diseases 
our goal is to provide physicians with critical information that may guide the healthcare management of their patients to prevent disease  diagnose the disease at an earlier stage when it may be treatable  determine the most appropriate therapy  assess the aggressiveness of their disease or even potentially prevent disease 
we employ a number of proprietary technologies  including dna  rna and protein analysis  that help us to understand the genetic basis of human disease and the role that genes and their related proteins may play in the onset and progression of disease 
we use this information to guide the development of new molecular diagnostic tests that are designed to assess an individual s risk for developing disease later in life predictive medicine  identify a patient s likelihood of responding to drug therapy and guide a patient s dosing to ensure optimal treatment personalized medicine  or assess a patient s risk of disease progression and disease recurrence prognostic medicine 
our business strategy for future growth is focused on three key initiatives 
first  we are working to grow and expand our existing products and markets 
second  we are developing our business internationally and have recently established sales operations and a reference laboratory in europe 
finally  we intend to launch new transformative products across a diverse set of disease indications  complementing our current businesses in oncology  women s health and urology 
on may   we completed the acquisition of the privately held molecular diagnostic company  rules based medicine  inc of austin  texas  for a cash purchase price of approximately million 
the acquired company has been consolidated into our operations as myriad rbm 
the acquisition expanded our product pipeline into new disease states  including neuroscience disorders  infectious diseases and inflammatory diseases  and added eight new molecular diagnostic test candidates to our current product pipeline 
we believe that myriad rbm s strategic collaborations with over major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  coupled with our position in parp inhibitors and pik inhibitors  will allow us to create a leading franchise in companion diagnostics 
in addition  our acquisition of myriad rbm provides us with access to samples from additional patient cohorts for our diagnostic product development and is expected to enhance our industry leading dna and rna technologies with in protein discovery and analysis 
during the fiscal year ended june   we devoted our resources to supporting and growing our transformative molecular diagnostic and companion diagnostic businesses  as well as to the research and development of future molecular diagnostic and companion diagnostic candidates 
see note segment and related information in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding our operating segments 
our consolidated revenues primarily consisted of sales of molecular diagnostic tests through our myriad genetic laboratories subsidiary and companion diagnostic service revenue through our myriad rbm subsidiary 
during the year ended june   we reported net income of million and diluted earnings per share of that included income tax expense of million 
as of june   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we incurred research and development expenses of million  million  and million for the years ended june   and  respectively 
our research and development expenses include costs incurred in maintaining and improving our nine current molecular diagnostic tests offerings and costs incurred for the discovery  development and validation of our pipeline of molecular diagnostic and companion diagnostic test candidates 

table of contents our selling  general and administrative expenses include costs associated with growing our molecular diagnostic and companion diagnostic businesses domestically and internationally 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related personnel costs for sales  marketing  customer service  billing and collection  executive  legal  finance and accounting  information technology  human resources  and allocated facilities expenses 
we expect that our selling  general and administrative expenses will increase from quarter to quarter and that such increases may be substantial  depending on the number and scope of any new molecular diagnostic and companion diagnostic launches  our efforts in support of our existing molecular diagnostic tests and companion diagnostic services as well as our continued international expansion efforts 
between may and august  we repurchased million of our outstanding common stock 
on august   our board of directors authorized us to repurchase an additional million of our outstanding common stock 
in connection with this latest stock repurchase authorization  we have been authorized to repurchase shares at management s discretion based on market conditions and have repurchased million of our outstanding common stock as of june  under this authorization

critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those policies which are both important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  share based payment expense  goodwill  and income taxes revenue recognition 
revenue includes the sale of molecular diagnostic tests for our predictive  personalized and prognostic medicine tests  and is recorded at the invoiced amount net of any discounts or allowances 
molecular diagnostic testing revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
revenue also includes sales of our companion diagnostic services and is also recorded at the invoiced amount net of any discounts or allowances 
revenue is recognized upon completion of the test or service  communication of results  and when collectability is reasonably assured 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
trade accounts receivable are comprised of amounts due from sales of our molecular diagnostic tests  which are recorded net of any discounts or contractual allowances 
we analyze trade accounts receivable and consider historic experience  customer creditworthiness  facts and circumstances specific to outstanding balances  and payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we periodically evaluate and adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts through a charge or credit to expense when trends or significant events indicate that a change in estimate is appropriate 
such changes in estimate could materially affect our results of operations or financial position  however  to date these changes have not been material 
it is possible that we may need to adjust our estimates in future periods 
after a review of our allowance for doubtful accounts as of june  and  we have determined that a hypothetical ten percent increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts would result in additional bad debt expense and an increase to our allowance for doubtful accounts of  and  respectively 
share based payment expense 
we recognize share based equity compensation in our consolidated statements of income at the grant date fair value of our stock options 
the determination of grant date fair value is estimated using an option pricing model  which includes variables such as the expected volatility of our share price  the exercise 
table of contents behavior of our employees  interest rates  and dividend yields 
these variables are projected based on our historical data  experience  and other factors 
changes in any of these variables could result in material increases to the valuation of options granted in future periods and increases in the expense recognized for share based payments 
goodwill 
we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and in the interim by reporting unit if events and circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired 
the events and circumstances that are considered include business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators and competition 
impairment of goodwill is evaluated on a qualitative basis to determine if using a two step process is necessary 
if the qualitative assessment suggests that impairment is more likely than not  a two step impairment analysis is performed 
the first step involves comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the process involves a comparison of the fair value and the carrying amount of the goodwill of that reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of carrying value over fair value 
if an event occurs that would cause a revision to the estimates and assumptions used in analyzing the value of the goodwill  the revision could result in a non cash impairment charge that could have a material impact on the financial results 
at june   the company has recorded goodwill of  related to the companion diagnostic segment  which we have concluded represents a reporting unit 
we measured the fair value of the companion diagnostic reporting unit utilizing an income approach  considering management s business plans and projections as the basis for expected cash flows for the next five years and a residual growth rate thereafter 
we also used a weighted average discount rate of for the analysis 
other significant estimates used in the discounted cash flow analysis include the profitability of the respective reporting unit and working capital effects 
we noted the fair value of the companion diagnostic reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by less than using these assumptions mentioned 
a hypothetical increase in the weighted average discount rate of would decrease the calculated fair value as a percentage of book value for the companion diagnostic reporting unit by 
a hypothetical decrease in the residual growth rate of would decrease the calculated fair value as a percent of book value for the companion diagnostic reporting unit by 
income taxes 
our income tax provision is based on income before taxes and is computed using the liability method in accordance with accounting standards codification asc income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates projected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
significant estimates are required in determining our provision for income taxes 
some of these estimates are based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations  or the expected results from any future tax examinations 
various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our future provision for income taxes 
those factors include  but are not limited to  changes in tax laws  regulations and or rates  the results of any future tax examinations  changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations  changes in estimates of prior years items  past levels of r d spending  acquisitions  changes in our corporate structure  and changes in overall levels of income before taxes all of which may result in periodic revisions to our provision for income taxes 
developing our provision for income taxes  including our effective tax rate and analysis of potential uncertain tax positions  if any  requires significant judgment and expertise in federal and state income tax laws  regulations and strategies  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any estimated valuation allowance we deem necessary to offset deferred tax assets 
during the fiscal year ended june   we determined that a valuation allowance was not required for a substantial portion of our deferred tax assets because we have established a sufficient history of taxable income from operations 
however  if we do not maintain taxable income from operations in future periods  we may increase the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets and record material adjustments to our income tax expense 
our judgment and tax strategies are subject to audit by various taxing authorities 
while we believe we have provided adequately for our uncertain income tax positions in our consolidated financial statements  adverse determination by these taxing authorities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
interest and penalties on income tax items are included as a component of overall income tax expense 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued amended standards related to fair value measurements and disclosures that result in common fair value measurement and disclosures between gaap and international financial reporting standards 

table of contents the standards include amendments that clarify the intent behind the application of existing fair value measurements and disclosures and the other amendments which change principles or requirements for fair value measurements or disclosures 
this guidance is effective for fiscal year and is to be applied prospectively 
accordingly we will adopt these standards on july  the adoption is not expected to have a material effect on our financial results or disclosures 
in june  the fasb issued amended standards requiring comprehensive income to be presented as either one continuous statement of comprehensive income or two separate but consecutive statements 
the amended standards do not affect the reported amounts of comprehensive income 
in december  the fasb deferred the requirement to present components of reclassifications of other comprehensive income on the face of the income statement that had previously been included in the june amended standard 
this guidance is effective for fiscal year and is to be applied retrospectively 
accordingly we will adopt these standards on july  the adoption is not expected to have an impact on our financial results or disclosures but will have an impact on the presentation of comprehensive income 
results of operations years ended june  and revenue is comprised of sales of our molecular diagnostic tests and companion diagnostic services 
total revenue for the fiscal year ended june  was million compared to million for the prior fiscal year  an increase of 
of this increase in revenue  approximately is attributable to increased molecular diagnostic testing volume and approximately is due to companion diagnostic service revenue in connection with our acquisition of myriad rbm on may  sales of our bracanalysis test accounted for of our total revenues in fiscal compared to in the prior year 
we believe that increased sales  marketing  and education efforts resulted in wider acceptance of our tests by the medical community and increased patient testing volumes 
there can be no assurance that revenues will continue to increase or remain at current levels or that we will be successful in expanding the sale of our tests outside the united states

sales of molecular diagnostic tests in each market for the fiscal years ended june  and were as follows june  in thousands change molecular diagnostic revenues oncology women s health total molecular diagnostic revenues cost of molecular diagnostic revenue is comprised primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  laboratory supplies  royalty payments  equipment costs and facilities expense 
cost of molecular diagnostic testing revenue for the fiscal year ended june  was million compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
this increase of in molecular diagnostic cost of revenue is primarily due to the increase in molecular diagnostic testing volumes 
our costs of companion diagnostic services include similar items 
cost of companion diagnostic services was million for the fiscal year ended june  many of these costs associated with the performance of our companion diagnostic services are fixed  consequently  gross margins will vary as we experience fluctuations in our companion diagnostic service revenue 
our cost of revenue may fluctuate based on the introduction of new molecular diagnostic tests  changes in companion diagnostic services  price changes of existing tests and services  changes in our costs associated with such tests and services  new technologies and operating systems to integrate into our molecular diagnostic laboratories and costs associated with operating a molecular diagnostic laboratory outside the united states 
research and development expenses are comprised primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  laboratory supplies  molecular and companion diagnostic development  equipment and facility costs 
research and development expenses incurred during the fiscal year ended june  were million compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
this increase of was primarily due to the following an additional million in protein biomarker discovery costs for companion diagnostic development at our newly acquired myriad rbm subsidiary  an increase of approximately million in internal development activities and clinical studies to support our existing molecular diagnostic testing products  an increase of approximately million in clinical studies to support future molecular diagnostic testing products  and an increase of approximately million for the in license of new molecular diagnostic product candidates 
we expect our research and development expenses will increase over the next several years as we work to develop our product pipeline and introduce new molecular diagnostic and companion diagnostic tests 
our selling  general and administrative expenses include costs associated with growing our molecular diagnostic and companion diagnostic businesses domestically and internationally 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related personnel costs for sales  marketing  customer service  billing and collection  executive  legal  finance and accounting  information technology  human resources  and allocated facilities expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended june  were million compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expense of was due primarily to support the increase in revenue and include an increase in sales and marketing expense of approximately million due to various marketing programs and initiatives  added headcount and increased sales commissions  the addition of million of administrative costs from myriad rbm  an increase of approximately million in bad debt expense  some of which was associated with the increase in revenues  an increase of approximately million in international administrative costs from our european operations  and 
table of contents an increase in share based compensation expense of approximately million 
we expect that our selling  general and administrative expenses will continue to increase and that such increases may be substantial  depending on the number and scope of any new molecular diagnostic and companion diagnostic product launches  our efforts in support of our existing molecular diagnostic tests and companion diagnostic services as well as our continued international expansion efforts 
interest income for the fiscal year ended june  was million  compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
the increase was due primarily to interest income recorded from a million note receivable with crescendo bioscience  inc  or crescendo 
income tax expense for the fiscal year ended june  was million  for an effective rate of approximately  compared to income tax expense of million and an effective rate of approximately in the period 
income tax expense for the year ended june  was based on the application of an annual effective tax rate  adjusted by discrete items recognized during the period 
our annual effective tax rate is a product of the us federal statutory rate of  a blended state income tax rate of and a impact from our international operations 
the effective rate is adjusted by alternative minimum income taxes and timing differences related to the recognition of the tax effect of equity compensation expense from incentive stock options and the deduction realized if those options are disqualified upon exercise 
certain significant or unusual items are separately recognized during the period in which they occur and can be a source of variability in the effective tax rates from period to period 
for the year ended june  we realized million of excess tax benefits from stock based compensation as a reduction of taxes payable 
excess tax benefits from stock based compensation are credited directly to additional paid in capital and are not included in income tax expense 
accordingly  they do not impact our effective income tax rate 
due to the realization of these excess tax benefits that offset our taxes payable  our current income tax expense in fiscal is significantly higher than our actual cash paid 
see note in the fiscal notes to consolidated financial statements 
net income for the fiscal year ended june  was million compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in revenues partially offset by higher research and development expenses 
earnings per diluted share was for the fiscal year ended june  as compared to for the prior fiscal year  an increase of 
this increase was due to a larger net income and a reduced number of weighted shares outstanding during the fiscal year due to the company s share repurchase program

table of contents effects of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our business  revenues  or operating results during the periods presented 
certain factors that may affect future results of operations the securities and exchange commission encourages companies to disclose forward looking information so that investors can better understand a company s future prospects and make informed investment decisions 
this annual report on form k contains such forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of words such as may  anticipate  estimate  expects  projects  intends  plans  believes and words and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance  identify forward looking statements 
all forward looking statements are management s present expectations of future events and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those described in the forward looking statements 
these risks include  but are not limited to the risk that sales and profit margins of our existing molecular diagnostic tests and companion diagnostic services may decline or will not continue to increase at historical rates  the risk that we may be unable to develop or achieve commercial success for additional molecular diagnostic tests and companion diagnostic services in a timely manner  or at all  the risk that we may not successfully develop new markets for our molecular diagnostic tests and companion diagnostic services  including our ability to successfully generate revenue outside the united states  the risk that licenses to the technology underlying our molecular diagnostic tests and companion diagnostic services tests and any future tests are terminated or cannot be maintained on satisfactory terms  risks related to delays or other problems with operating our laboratory testing facilities  risks related to public concern over our genetic testing in general or our tests in particular  risks related to regulatory requirements or enforcement in the united states and foreign countries and changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems  risks related to our ability to obtain new corporate collaborations or licenses and acquire new technologies or businesses on satisfactory terms  if at all  risks relating to our ability to successfully integrate and derive benefits from any technologies or businesses that we license or acquire  the development of competing tests and services  the risk that we or our licensors may be unable to protect the proprietary technologies underlying our tests  the risk of patent infringement or challenges to the validity of our patent claims  risks of new  changing and competitive technologies and regulations in the united states and internationally  and other factors discussed under the heading risk factors contained in item a of this annual report

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain an investment portfolio in accordance with our written investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
our investments consist of securities of various types and maturities of five years or less  with a maximum average maturity of three years 
these securities are classified as available for sale 
available for sale securities are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses reported as part of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
realized gains and losses on investment security transactions are reported on the specific identification method 
dividend and interest income are recognized when earned 
a decline in the market value of any available for sale security below cost that is deemed other than temporary results in a charge to earnings and establishes a new cost basis for the security 

table of contents although our investment policy guidelines are intended to ensure the preservation of principal  current market conditions have resulted in high levels of uncertainty 
our ability to trade or redeem the marketable investment securities in which we invest  including certain corporate bonds and auction rate securities  has become difficult 
valuation and pricing of these securities has also become variable and subject to uncertainty 
as of june  we have net unrealized gains of thousand in our investment portfolio 
for the year ended june  we have experienced fluctuations in our portfolio value primarily from our investments in bonds of financial institutions 
if interest rates rise  the market value of our investments may decline  which could result in a realized loss if we are forced to sell an investment before its scheduled maturity 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates by basis points would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our net investment position of approximately million and million as of june  and  respectively 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risks
