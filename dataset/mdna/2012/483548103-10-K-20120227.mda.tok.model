overview of business kaman corporation is composed of two business segments industrial distribution  the third largest power transmission motion control industrial distributor in north america 
aerospace  a manufacturer and subcontractor in the international  commercial and military aerospace and defense markets 
financial performance net sales increased compared to the prior year 
net earnings increased compared to the prior year 
diluted earnings per share  when compared to the prior year  increased to 
cash flows provided by operating activities were million for  an increase of million when compared to the prior year 
our industrial distribution segment had record annual sales of million 
in  we elected to change our method of recognizing pension expense 
previously  for our non contributory qualified defined benefit pension plan qualified pension plan we used the market related value of plan assets reflecting changes in the fair value of plan assets amortized over a four year period 
under the new accounting method  the market related value of plan assets reflects the actual change in the fair value of plan assets for the year 
this change has been adopted through retrospective application of the new policy to all periods presented 
our diluted earnings per share would have been lower by had we accounted for the pension expense under the previous methodology 
see note  accounting changes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for the impact of all adjustments made to the financial statements as a result of this change 
significant acquisitions completed during the year on december   we acquired catching fluidpower  inc catching of bolingbrook  illinois and on september   we acquired the assets of target electronic supply target of westwood  massachusetts 
these acquisitions have been included in our industrial distribution segment 
on november   we acquired vermont composites  inc vermont composites of bennington  vermont  which has been included in our aerospace segment 
total consideration paid for these three acquisitions was million  inclusive of working capital adjustments and contingent consideration 
key events on december   we entered into an agreement with the us government usg to settle lawsuits related to our prior fmu fuze program 
the terms of the settlement with the us government required us to make a million payment  which was made in january in addition  both parties have released each other as to the subject matter of the litigation  the usg has withdrawn its fraud allegation and neither party has admitted liability 
separately  we wrote off program related inventory in the amount of million  net of reserves  bringing the total pre tax impact of the settlement to million 
on december   in conjunction with the acquisition of catching  parker hannifin corporation parker recognized us nationally as a value added reseller of parker hydraulics  fluid connector and automation products 
this will allow us full access to the parker motion technologies portfolio of products across all of its us locations utilizing local authorized parker distributors 
on september   the us navy and us marine corps selected the lockheed martin kaman unmanned k max for deployment to afghanistan 
the decision followed the successful completion of a five day quick reaction assessment for the us navy s cargo unmanned aircraft systems uas program 
two aircraft were deployed to afghanistan in the fourth quarter of at various times during we experienced problems during acceptance testing of fuzes produced for our joint programmable fuze jpf program that caused us to halt production multiple times throughout the year 
the acceptance testing failures resulted from issues with test equipment and testing procedures  as well as an isolated component failure 
despite these issues we were able to deliver approximately  units during the fourth quarter before having to halt deliveries again 
in cooperation with our customer  we analyzed  tested and verified the root causes of the acceptance testing failures and developed a plan to remediate the situation 
as a result  we resumed acceptance testing in january 
the recent jpf competitive source selection by the us government has transitioned into a sole source negotiation between us and the united states air force usaf 
based on the time needed for the us government to audit our proposal  and for contract negotiations to be completed  contract award is not expected until mid through december   we have made cumulative payments of million aud to the commonwealth of australia in accordance with our settlement agreement related to the sh g a helicopters 
of this amount  million aud was paid in  of which million aud was paid on march  at the exchange rate in effect on that date  the us dollar value of the payment was million  however  through the use of australian dollar foreign currency exchange contracts entered into in we were able to acquire the million aud for million 
during the second quarter  we amended our revolving credit facility and term loan agreement 
the amendments  among other things  allowed us to reduce the interest rates on these facilities to libor plus basis points compared to an interest rate of libor plus basis points prior to the amendments 
during the first quarter  we were awarded a million order from the usaf under option of our jpf program 
during the second quarter  we were awarded an additional million order from the usaf under option of our jpf program and a commercial jpf foreign military order of million 
during the first quarter of  we were awarded an additional million order from the usaf under option outlook as we look at  we anticipate growth in both of our segments 
our outlook is as follows industrial distribution sales of  million to  million  up to operating margin between and aerospace sales of million to million  up to operating margin between and corporate expenses in the range of million to million interest expense of approximately million estimated tax rate of free cash flow in the range of to million 
results of continuing operations consolidated results net sales in thousands industrial distribution aerospace total change change the increase in net sales for as compared to was attributable to an increase in organic sales at both our segments and the contribution of million in sales from the acquisitions completed in and foreign currency exchange rates had a million favorable impact on sales during see segment results of operations and financial condition below for further discussion of segment net sales 
the increase in net sales for as compared to was attributable to an increase in organic sales at our industrial distribution segment  the contribution of sales from our acquisitions and the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of million  partially offset by a decrease in organic sales at our aerospace segment 
see segment results of operations and financial condition below for further discussion of segment net sales 
gross profit in thousands gross profit change change of net sales gross profit increased in primarily due to organic increases in gross profit at both our segments and the contribution of gross profit from our and acquisitions 
the organic increase in gross profit in our industrial distribution segment was primarily a result of higher sales volume compared to the prior year and higher gross margin rates despite increased competitive price pressures 
the organic increase in gross profit in our aerospace segment was due to increased sales volume related to our bearing product lines for the commercial and regional business jet markets  commercial sales to foreign militaries of the jpf fuze  the contribution of gross profit from the k max unmanned aircraft systems and the absence of program related losses recorded in these increases were partially offset by decreased gross profit resulting from fewer shipments under our jpf fuze program to the usg  lower volume in our helicopter aftermarket programs and a reduction in c program volume 
gross profit increased for as compared to due to an increase in gross profit at both our segments 
the increase in industrial distribution gross profit was primarily a result of higher sales volume and the addition of gross profit from the acquisitions completed during the year 
the increase in gross profit at our aerospace segment was primarily due to an increase in gross profit for our jpf program resulting from the improved pricing related to deliveries under option  an increase in gross profit on the sikorsky black hawk helicopter program resulting from an increase in deliveries compared to the prior year and an increase in gross profit on our blade erosion coating programs 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in sales volume related to our bearing product lines  million in contract losses on the sikorsky canadian mh program  million in losses on our bell helicopter program due to inefficiencies and scrap on our initial production units  reduced gross profit on the c program due to a reduction in volume requirements  a reduction in sales resulting from lower volume on our helicopter after market programs  including egypt sh g e  and million in losses resulting from a reduction in quantities required by our customer for one of our fuze programs 
selling  general administrative expenses s  g a in thousands s  g a change change of net sales s  g a increased for as compared to due to increased expenses in both of our segments  including million of expenses related to our and acquisitions 
the higher expense at our industrial distribution segment was attributable to acquisitions and an increase in variable costs such as sales commissions and other employee related costs resulting from the higher sales volume 
the increase in expense at our aerospace segment was primarily due to the additional expenses resulting from the acquisition of global aerosystems  our acquisition of vermont composites  million in expense associated with the settlement of the fmu matter and higher employee related costs 
corporate expense was relatively flat for as compared to  with increases in our incentive compensation expense and group health insurance expense virtually offset by lower acquisition related costs  lower pension expense and a nonrecurring benefit of million associated with the death of a former executive 
s  g a increased for as compared to due to an increase in expense at both our segments offset by a decrease in corporate expense 
the higher expense at our industrial distribution segment was attributable to the acquisitions as well as the absence of certain one time benefits related to employee furloughs taken in and an increase in variable costs such as sales commissions and other employee related costs resulting from the higher sales volume 
the increase in expense at our aerospace segment was due to an increase in legal fees associated with the fmu program litigation matters 
the decrease in our corporate expenses was primarily due to a million decrease in pension expense  partially offset by million in acquisition related costs 
goodwill impairment in thousands goodwill impairment during the first quarter of  we were informally notified by a customer of its intent to terminate a contract that had been obtained in our acquisition of uk composites 
no sales were recognized related to the contract in question during the years ended december  or throughout  management worked with this customer to find an acceptable resolution and maintain the work there under 
during the fourth quarter of we received a contract termination notice and  as a result  removed all future revenue and related profit associated with this contract from the reporting unit s projections when preparing its annual test for impairment 
we do not believe the termination of the contract will have a significant impact on our liquidity 
this contract loss  in addition to a reduction in revenue for other programs  reduced the revenue and earnings growth forecast to levels below those anticipated at the reporting unit s acquisition in  creating a situation in which step of the impairment analysis resulted in a fair value for the reporting unit below its carrying value 
prior to proceeding to step of the impairment analysis  management assessed the tangible and intangible assets subject to amortization to determine if they were impaired 
based on this analysis these assets were determined not to be impaired 
upon completion of the step impairment analysis  we recorded a non cash non tax deductible goodwill impairment charge of million representing of the total goodwill balance for the reporting unit to reduce the carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value 
this charge has been included in the operating results of our aerospace segment 
see note  fair value measurements  and note  goodwill and other intangible assets  net  in the notes to consolidated financial statements and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies  for further discussion 
operating income in thousands operating income change change of net sales the increase in operating income for as compared to was driven by increases in operating income at both our segments 
the increase in operating income for as compared to was primarily driven by a significant increase in operating income at our industrial distribution segment  offset slightly by a decrease in operating income at our aerospace segment 
see segment results of operations and financial condition below for further discussion of segment operating income 
interest expense  net in thousands interest expense  net net interest expense generally consists of interest charged on the revolving credit facility and other borrowings and the amortization of debt issuance costs  offset by interest income 
the increases in net interest expense for as compared to were primarily due to the absence of the million of look back interest received in the prior year  interest expense on our convertible notes and higher amortization of capitalized fees  partly offset by lower interest rates on our revolving credit facility and lower average bank borrowings during the year 
the decrease in interest expense  net for as compared to is primarily due to the receipt of million of look back interest during the period  partially offset by an increase in interest expense 
the increase in interest expense is due to higher interest rates on amounts outstanding under our revolving credit agreement  increased amortization of capitalized fees and progressively higher borrowings under the revolving credit agreement as we funded the acquisitions completed in effective income tax rate effective income tax rate the effective tax rate represents the combined federal  state and foreign tax effects attributable to pretax earnings for the year 
the decrease in the effective rate for as compare to is due to the non cash non tax deductible goodwill impairment charge of million recorded by the aerospace segment in the increase in the effective tax rate for compared to is due to the non cash non tax deductible goodwill impairment charge of million recorded by the aerospace segment in  a non recurring tax benefit for foreign exchange losses incurred in as part of an international recapitalization

organic sales per sales day net sales acquisition sales organic sales sales days organic sales per sales day a a organic sales per sales day is a metric management uses to evaluate performance trends at its industrial distribution segment and is calculated by taking total organic sales divided by the number of sales days 
an acquisition is included in organic sales beginning with the thirteenth month following the date of acquisition 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations non gaap financial measures 
net sales net sales for increased as compared to due to a increase in organic sales  when measured on a same day sales basis  with our and acquisitions contributing million in sales for the growth in organic sales is due to increases in sales volume to both original equipment manufacturer oem and maintenance  repair and operations mro customers and the impact of favorable foreign currency exchange rates for of million 
the increase in net sales for as compared to is due to a increase in organic sales  when measured on a same day sales basis  with the acquisitions contributing million in sales for the growth in organic sales is due to increases in sales volume to both oem and mro customers and the impact of favorable foreign currency exchange rates for of million 
there were significant increases across all industries  particularly in mining  fabricated metal products and durable goods 
operating income operating income increased during as compared to primarily due to the increased sales volume and the resulting impact on our ability to leverage operating costs  higher gross margin and the contribution of operating income from our acquisitions 
the increases were partially offset by an increase in variable costs such as sales commissions and other employee related costs resulting from the higher sales volume 
operating income increased in compared to primarily due to the increase in sales volume and the resulting impact on our ability to leverage operating costs  higher rebate income  contributions from the three acquisitions completed in and the benefit of lower group health insurance expense 
the increases were partially offset by an increase in variable costs such as sales commissions and other employee related costs resulting from the higher sales volume and the absence of the benefit of the one time cost savings of million resulting from the business wide furlough in the second quarter of aerospace segment our strategy our strategy for the aerospace segment is to expand our global market position in defense and commercial markets  while maintaining leadership in product technical performance and application engineering support  while continuing to concentrate on lean manufacturing techniques  lead time reduction and low cost sourcing 
results of operations the following table presents selected financial data for our aerospace segment in thousands net sales change change operating income change change of net sales backlog on contract net sales net sales increased for as compared to due to an increase in sales volume on bearings products in the commercial and business regional jet markets  the incremental contribution of sales from the acquisition of global aerosystems and vermont composites  work on the us naval air systems command contract for k max unmanned aircraft systems  an increase in commercial sales of the jpf fuze to foreign militaries  higher volume on the egypt sh g e upgrade program  an increase in sales volume on our legacy fuze programs  and changes in foreign currency exchange rates which favorably impacted sales by million 
these increases were partially offset by reduced shipments to the usg of the jpf fuze resulting from issues encountered during acceptance testing that interrupted production at various times throughout the year  reduced requirements under our sikorsky black hawk helicopter cockpit program  reduced volume on our c program  and lower volume on our helicopter after market programs  including blade erosion coating programs 
net sales decreased for as compared to due to a decrease in sales volume on bearings products  lower volume on our helicopter after market programs  including the egypt sh g e upgrade program  our k max program and sales of sh g spare parts to new zealand  a reduction in c ship set deliveries due to a reduction in volume requirements and production interruptions at our customer s facility  and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate changes which impacted sales by million 
these decreases were partially offset by higher priced sales on our jpf program to the united states government usg  resulting from the completion of option and the transition to option  which has a higher per fuze price  commercial sales to foreign militaries of the jpf fuze  increased sales volume on our blade erosion coating programs  initial deliveries on our bell helicopter program  and increased sales volume on our sikorsky black hawk helicopter cockpit program 
operating income operating income increased for as compared to due to higher gross profit generated by our bearings products resulting from the increased sales volume noted above  contribution of gross profit from the k max unmanned aircraft systems  the absence of program related losses experienced in on the sikorsky canadian mh program and on one of our fuze programs  and operating income contributed by global aerosystems and to a lesser extent vermont composites 
these increases were partially offset by million in expense associated with the settlement of the fmu matter and decreased gross profit on our helicopter aftermarket programs due to decreased volume and a decrease in gross profit on our jpf program as a result of the suspension of deliveries due to the production issues encountered in the second half of operating income decreased for as compared to due to the million non cash non tax deductible goodwill charge taken at our uk composites reporting unit  losses resulting from a decrease in the number of required units and program delays on one of our fuze programs  reduced gross profit generated by our bearings products resulting from the lower sales volume noted above  a reduction in gross profit due to a reduction in c ship set volume requirements  losses recorded on our bell helicopter program due to inefficiencies on our initial production units  additional losses recorded on the sikorsky canadian mh helicopter program  as discussed below  and increased selling  general and administrative expenses related to legal fees associated with the fmu program 
these decreases were partially offset by the increased volume on our sikorsky black hawk helicopter cockpit program  increased gross profit on our jpf program due to more favorable pricing on option deliveries  gross profit associated with the higher sales volume of the jpf fuze to commercial customers and an increase in gross profit on our blade erosion coating programs 
backlog vermont composites  acquired in the fourth quarter of  added million to our december  backlog 
this increase was offset by a million reduction in the uh backlog  which we expect will increase as we begin to receive orders during the first half of the increase in backlog in compared to is the result of an increase in orders for our bearing products  new usg orders and commercial sales to foreign militaries under our jpf program  as well as the bell helicopter and a programs  which were awarded in  but for which orders were received during major programs product lines defense markets a the segment has contracted with boeing to produce the wing control surfaces inboard and outboard flaps  slats and deceleron assemblies for the us air force s a fleet 
this contract has a potential value of over million  however  annual quantities will vary  as they are dependent upon the orders boeing receives from the us air force 
initial deliveries under this program began in the third quarter of  however  our customer s scheduling has changed and the timing of deliveries has shifted 
we expect full rate production for this program to begin in the fourth quarter of  with an average of approximately ship sets being delivered per year thereafter 
bearings our bearings products are included on military platforms manufactured in north america and europe 
these products are used as original equipment and or specified as replacement parts by the manufacturers 
the most significant portion of our military sales is derived from us military platforms  such as the ah  c and f a aircraft  and sales in europe for the typhoon program 
these products are primarily proprietary self lubricating  ball and roller bearings for aircraft flight controls  turbine engines  and landing gear and driveline couplings for helicopters 
black hawk the sikorsky black hawk helicopter cockpit program involves the manufacture of cockpits including the installation of all wiring harnesses  hydraulic assemblies  control pedals and sticks  seat tracks  pneumatic lines  and the composite structure that holds the windscreen for most models of the black hawk helicopter 
we are currently in the process of negotiating the next option under this program  which will allow us to continue to perform work under this program through orders placed to date for the program will allow us to continue deliveries into the segment also performs additional subcontract work involving blade erosion coating 
c the segment continues production of structural wing subassemblies for the boeing c we received additional orders under this program that will extend our work beyond during  we delivered ship sets 
we currently have orders for ship sets to be delivered in and beyond 
egypt sh g e the segment continues work under a program for depot level maintenance and upgrades for nine kaman sh g e helicopters originally delivered to the egyptian government during the s 
this program has a total contract value of approximately million and  as of december   is fully funded 
fmu joint programmable fuze jpf we manufacture the jpf  an electro mechanical bomb safe and arming device  which allows the settings of a weapon to be programmed in flight 
during  we entered into a contract modification with the usg for the award of options  and under our multi option jpf contract 
during the first quarter  we were awarded a million jpf order from the united states air force usaf for fuzes to be delivered in and under option of the program 
during the second quarter  we were awarded an additional million order from the usaf under option of our jpf program and a commercial jpf foreign military order of million 
total jpf backlog at december   is million 
during the first quarter of  we were awarded an additional million order from the usaf under option at various times during  we experienced issues during acceptance testing of fuzes produced for our jpf program that caused us to suspend deliveries multiple times 
the acceptance testing failures resulted from issues with test equipment and testing procedures  as well as an isolated component failure 
despite these issues we were able to deliver approximately  units during the fourth quarter before having to halt deliveries again 
in cooperation with our customer  we analyzed  tested and verified the root causes of these acceptance testing failures and developed a plan to remediate the issues 
as a result we resumed acceptance testing in january 
the recent jpf competitive source selection by the us government has transitioned into a sole source negotiation between us and the usaf 
based on the time needed for the us government to audit our proposal  and for contract negotiations to be completed  contract award is not expected until mid mh the sikorsky canadian mh helicopter program includes the manufacture and assembly of composite tail rotor pylons 
this program has undergone numerous customer directed design changes that caused costs on this program to exceed the originally proposed price for the contract 
during  we finalized contract price negotiations for this program increasing the contract value from million to approximately million 
although we received additional consideration for this contract we were not able to recover all the anticipated cost growth and because the price was less than anticipated we recorded a million contract loss during the third quarter of to date  we have recorded million in contract losses  and of this amount  million was recorded in no such charges were recorded in us army in december  we signed a million contract with the us army to perform blade erosion coating on helicopter blades 
initial deliveries began in the first quarter of and as of december  we have completed deliveries under this contract 
under all blade erosion coating contracts with the us army  we delivered blades through december  although this program is complete  we will continue to perform blade erosion coating for helicopter blades for sikorsky  which may include additional blades for the us army 
commercial markets in late  we signed a seven year follow on contract with boeing for the production of fixed wing trailing edge assemblies for the boeing and aircraft 
during  on average we delivered ship sets per month on the boeing platform and ship sets per month on the boeing for  we currently estimate deliveries on these programs to be consistent with this multiyear contract has a potential value in excess of million  however  annual quantities will vary  as they are dependent upon the orders boeing receives from its customers 
airbus our uk composites operations provide composite components for many airbus platforms 
the most significant of these are the a  a and a orders for these components are dependent on the customer s build rate 
bearings our bearings products are included on commercial airliners and regional business jets manufactured in north and south america  europe and asia and are used as original equipment and or specified as replacement parts by airlines and aircraft manufacturers 
these products are primarily proprietary self lubricating  ball and roller bearings for aircraft flight controls  turbine engines  and landing gear  and driveline couplings for helicopters 
the most significant portion of our commercial sales is derived from boeing and airbus platforms  such as the boeing   and and the airbus a  a  a and a bell helicopter in september  we were awarded a five year contract with a potential value of million to build composite helicopter blade skins and skin core assemblies for bell helicopter 
under the terms of the contract  we will provide different assemblies for h       and ba aircraft 
all work is being performed at our full service aerospace innovation and manufacturing support center in bloomfield  connecticut 
first article deliveries to bell s hurst  texas facility began in late  with full production starting in the first quarter of through december   the total sales value for our deliveries totaled million 
annual quantities for this program will vary  as they are dependent upon the orders bell receives from its customers 
other matters sh g i we continue to work with potential customers for the sale of sh g i aircraft  spare parts and equipment 
several foreign governments have expressed various levels of interest in the aircraft and we have received small orders for the spare parts and related equipment 
fmu on december   we entered into an agreement with the us government usg to settle lawsuits related to our prior fmu fuze program 
the terms of the settlement with the us government required us to make a million payment  which was made in january in addition  both parties have released each other as to the subject matter of the litigation  the usg has withdrawn its fraud allegation and neither party has admitted liability 
separately  we wrote off program related inventory in the amount of million  net of reserves  bringing the total pre tax impact of the settlement to million
