item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion compares the company s financial condition at december  to its financial condition at december  and the results of operations for the years ended december    and this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing in item of part ii of this annual report 
performance overview the company recorded a net loss of thousand in  compared to a net loss of million for and net income of million for the basic and diluted loss per common share was for and for the basic and diluted earnings per common share was for when comparing to  the principal factors resulting in the lower net loss were a million decrease in goodwill and other intangible assets impairment charges and a million decrease in the provision for credit losses  which were partially offset by a decline in net interest income of million 
during  the economic downturn continued to negatively impact our loan portfolio performance and our overall financial performance 
for  the main contributors to the net loss were goodwill and other impairment charges of million and a higher provision for credit losses of million when compared to during  net income available to common stockholders was negatively impacted by dividends and discount accretion associated with the sale and subsequent redemption of the company s series a preferred stock issued to the united states department of the treasury the treasury under the treasury s troubled asset relief program capital purchase program the tarp cpp 
the impact on earnings from the preferred stock activity was million 
return on average assets was for  compared to for and for return on average stockholders equity for was  compared to for and for average assets were billion for  a slight increase when compared to average loans decreased to million while average earning assets increased slightly to billion 
average deposits increased to million while average stockholders equity decreased to million for comparing to  average assets increased less than  average loans decreased less than  and average earning assets remained relatively unchanged 
average deposits increased while average stockholders equity decreased for critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and follow general practices within the industries in which it operates 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions  and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources  when available 
the most significant accounting policies that the company follows are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the notes to the financial statement and in this discussion  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has determined that the accounting policy with respect to the allowance for credit losses to be the accounting area that requires the most subjective or complex judgments  and  as such  could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
accordingly  the allowance for credit losses is considered to be a critical accounting policy  along with goodwill and other intangible assets and fair value  as discussed below 
the allowance for credit losses represents management s estimate of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheets 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for credit losses 
a discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for credit losses is included in the provision for credit losses and risk management section of this discussion 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
other intangible assets represent purchased assets that also lack physical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual or other legal rights or because the asset is capable of being sold or exchanged either on its own or in combination with a related contract  asset or liability 
goodwill and other intangible assets are required to be recorded at fair value 
determining fair value is subjective  requiring the use of estimates  assumptions and management judgment 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested at least annually for impairment  usually during the third quarter  or on an interim basis if circumstances dictate 
intangible assets that have finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and also are subject to impairment testing 
impairment testing requires that the fair value of each of the company s reporting units be compared to the carrying amount of its net assets  including goodwill 
the company s reporting units were identified based on an analysis of each of its individual operating segments 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than book value  an expense may be required to write down the related goodwill or purchased intangibles to record an impairment loss 
the company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value  with the measurements made on a recurring or nonrecurring basis 
significant financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis are investment securities and interest rate caps 
impaired loans and other real estate and other assets owned are significant financial instruments measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis 
fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
in determining fair value  the company is required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs  reducing subjectivity 
recent accounting pronouncements and developments the fasb s asc became effective on july  at that date  the codification became fasb s officially recognized source of authoritative us generally accepted accounting principles gaap applicable to all public and non public non governmental entities  superseding existing fasb  american institute of certified public accountants aicpa  emerging issues task force eitf and related literature 
rules and interpretive releases of the sec under the authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
all other accounting literature is considered non authoritative 
the switch to the codification affects the way companies refer to us gaap in financial statements and accounting policies 
citing particular content in the codification involves specifying the unique numeric path to the content through the topic  subtopic  section and paragraph structure 
note to the consolidated financial statements discusses new accounting policies that the company adopted during and the expected impact of accounting policies recently issued or proposed but not yet required to be adopted 
to the extent the adoption of new accounting standards materially affects our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity  the impacts are discussed in the applicable section s of this discussion and notes to the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations net interest income and net interest margin net interest income remains the most significant component of our earnings 
it is the excess of interest and fees earned on total average earning assets loans  investment securities  federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits with other banks over interest owed on average interest bearing liabilities deposits and borrowings 
as shown in the table below  tax equivalent net interest income for was million  a decrease from the decrease was primarily due to lower yields earned on average earning assets and a decline in higher yielding average loan balances 
tax equivalent net interest income for was million  a increase over the increase was primarily due to lower rates paid on interest bearing liabilities offsetting the decline in yields on earning assets our net interest margin ie  tax equivalent net interest income divided by average earning assets represents the net yield on earning assets 
the net interest margin is managed through loan and deposit pricing and asset liability strategies 
the net interest margin was for  compared to for  representing a decline of basis points due to the decrease in net interest income 
the increase in net interest income in when compared to was enough to improve the net interest margin by basis points 
the net interest spread  which is the difference between the average yield on earning assets and the rate paid for interest bearing liabilities  was for  for and for the following table sets forth the major components of net interest income  on a tax equivalent basis  for the years ended december    and average interest yield average interest yield average interest yield dollars in thousands balance rate balance rate balance rate earning assets loans    investment securities taxable     tax exempt   federal funds sold   interest bearing deposits   total earning assets   cash and due from banks   other assets   allowance for credit losses   total assets   interest bearing liabilities demand deposits   money market and savings deposits   certificates of deposit   or more   other time deposits    interest bearing deposits   short term borrowings   long term debt  total interest bearing liabilities   noninterest bearing deposits   other liabilities   stockholders equity   total liabilities and stockholders equity  net interest spread   net interest margin all amounts are reported on a tax equivalent basis computed using the statutory federal income tax rate of for and and for  exclusive of the alternative minimum tax rate and nondeductible interest expense 
the tax equivalent adjustment amounts used in the above table to compute yields aggregated thousand in  thousand in and thousand in average loan balances include nonaccrual loans 
interest income on loans includes amortized loan fees  net of costs  and all are included in the yield calculations 
interest expense on money market and savings deposits includes expense on deposits related to the promontory insured network deposits program 
the interest expense for these deposits was million for  thousand for and thousand for on a tax equivalent basis  total interest income was million for  compared to million for and million for for  average earning assets remained relatively unchanged but yields earned decreased basis points  mainly due to loan activity  which reduced interest income by million when compared to during  average loans decreased million and the yield earned on loans decreased basis points 
interest income for also declined when compared to mainly due to a decrease of million in average loans and a decrease of basis points in the yield on loans 
excluding average nonaccrual loans  the yield on loans would have been  and for   and  respectively 
the changes in all other average earning assets included increases in interest bearing deposits with other banks and taxable investment securities of million and million  respectively  when compared to and decreases in federal funds sold and tax exempt investment securities of million and million  respectively  when compared to during  the investment of excess cash from customers deposits shifted from federal funds sold to interest bearing deposits in other banks  primarily with the federal reserve bank  to take advantage of higher yields on these deposits 
similarly for  average taxable investment securities and interest bearing deposits increased while average federal funds sold and tax exempt investment securities decreased 
as a percentage of total average earning assets  loans  investment securities  federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits were   and  respectively  for the comparable percentages were    and  respectively  for and    and  respectively  for the yields on all other earning assets in declined when compared to except for the yield on interest bearing deposits which increased four basis points 
likewise  the yields on all other earning assets decreased in when compared to yields in except for the yield on federal funds sold which increased one basis point 
when comparing to  the overall decrease in yields on earning assets produced million less in interest income and the decrease in average balances of earning assets produced million less in interest income  as seen in the rate volume variance analysis below 
both rate and volume variances for interest income were primarily impacted by loan activity 
in  the million decrease in interest income was almost all due to lower rates 
interest expense was million for  compared to million for and million for although overall volume increased slightly  lower rates paid for interest bearing liabilities were the main reason for the decrease in interest expense in a similar situation prevailed during  with overall volumes of interest bearing liabilities increasing but rates decreasing enough to reduce interest expense 
interest expense on time deposits certificates of deposit of  or more and other time deposits had the largest effect on the decrease in interest expense  declining million when compared to the decrease in interest expense was due to a decrease of million in average time deposits and a decrease of basis points on rates paid on these deposits when compared to the decrease in average time deposits reflected a decrease in the company s liquidity needs and the lower rates reflected current market conditions 
for  average time deposits decreased million and rates paid decreased basis points when compared to during  average interest bearing demand deposits and money market and savings deposits increased million  offsetting the decline in average time deposits 
the rates paid on average interest bearing demand deposits decreased basis points but the rates paid on money market and savings deposits increased basis points 
the changes in average balances and rates paid on these deposits increased interest expense by thousand when compared to interest expense for money market deposits included thousand more in than in related to the promontory insured network deposits program the ind program 
see the section below entitled deposits for additional information 
in  the movement from time deposits to interest bearing demand and money market and other savings deposits reflected a shift in customer investment needs 
for  average interest bearing demand deposits and money market and savings deposits increased million and the rates paid on these deposits increased basis points 
during  lower rates on interest bearing liabilities produced million less in interest expense and decreased volume produced thousand less in interest expense  as shown in the table below 
both rate and volume variances for interest expense were primarily impacted by time deposit activity 
in  lower rates produced million less in interest expense while increased volume produced thousand more in interest expense 
the following rate volume variance analysis identifies the portion of the changes in tax equivalent net interest income attributable to changes in volume of average balances or to changes in the yield on earning assets and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities

noninterest income noninterest income decreased thousand  or  in when compared to this compared to a decrease of million  or  in when compared to the decrease in noninterest income in when compared to was mainly due to declines in insurance agency commissions of thousand  service charges on deposit accounts of thousand and other noninterest income of thousand 
the decline in insurance agency commissions reflected the ongoing soft market in the insurance industry and the decline in service charges on deposit accounts reflected a decrease in customer use of overdraft protection programs 
the primary reasons for the lower amount in other noninterest income was a thousand gain relating to the surrender of directors life insurance policies in and thousand less in mortgage broker fees in the company terminated the operations of its mortgage subsidiary during and now conducts brokerage activities through a minority series investment in an unrelated delaware limited liability company under the name wye mortgage group 
during and  wye mortgage group generated income of thousand and a loss of thousand  respectively 
in  the decreases in noninterest income were partially offset by thousand in gains on sales of investment securities 
the decrease in noninterest income in when compared to was mainly due to a decline in insurance agency commissions of million  a decline in mortgage broker fees of thousand and a mark to market gain of thousand on interest rate swaps in the decline in insurance agency commissions reflected the continuing soft market in the insurance industry 
mortgage broker fees declined since the company began conducting brokerage activities in through its unconsolidated subsidiary  wye mortgage group  the results of which were reported in other noninterest income 
the decrease in noninterest income was partially offset by increases in trust and investment fee income and other noninterest income of thousand and thousand  respectively 
other noninterest income included the thousand gain relating to the surrender of directors life insurance policies

the company recorded goodwill impairment charges of million and other intangible assets impairment charges of thousand 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the impact of goodwill and other intangible assets on the financial statements 
when comparing to  in addition to the large decrease in impairment charges  salaries and wages declined thousand due to cost containment measures  fdic insurance premium expense declined thousand due to regulatory changes in the calculation of the premium  and insurance agency commissions expense declined thousand 
these decreases in expenses were somewhat offset by higher expenses related to other real estate owned activities reported in other noninterest expense and higher data processing charges related to the merger of the felton bank into cnb during the first quarter of a significant portion of the increase in noninterest expense in when compared to was due to goodwill and other intangible assets impairment charges of million 
as a result of the annual assessment for goodwill and other intangible assets impairment  it was determined that goodwill was impaired at one of the banks and goodwill and other intangible assets were impaired in our wholesale insurance business 
the company recorded goodwill impairment charges of million at that bank and goodwill impairment charges of million and other intangible assets impairment charges of thousand at the wholesale insurance business 
other noninterest expenses for increased thousand when compared to  over half of which included expenses related to collection and other real estate owned activities 
partially offsetting these increases in expense were a decrease in salaries and wages of million and a decrease in employee benefits of thousand reflecting lower expenses accrued for bonus and profit sharing plans which are a part of overall cost containment measures taken by the company 
insurance agency commissions expense and fdic insurance premium expense decreased thousand and thousand  respectively

total interest bearing deposits with other banks and federal funds sold increased million from million at december  to million at december  average interest bearing deposits with other banks and federal funds sold increased million to million for the year ended december  during  the investment of excess cash from customers deposits shifted from federal funds sold  which decreased million  to interest bearing deposits in other banks  which increased million  to take advantage of higher yields on these deposits 
total interest bearing deposits with other banks and federal funds sold decreased from the end of to the end of average interest bearing deposits with other banks and federal funds sold decreased million in the fluctuations in these accounts reflected that there was less excess cash in than in investment securities the investment portfolio is structured to provide us with liquidity and also plays an important role in the overall management of interest rate risk 
investment securities available for sale are stated at estimated fair value based on quoted market prices

with the exception of municipal securities  our general practice is to classify all newly purchased securities as available for sale 
investment securities available for sale were million at the end of and million at the end of investment securities available for sale increased million  or  in  much higher than the million  or  in the larger increase in investment securities available for sale reflected that there were more funds available for investing in securities than were needed for funding loans during than in at year end  of the securities in the portfolio were us government agencies and of the securities were mortgage backed securities  compared to and  respectively  at year end  reflecting a shift in the composition of the portfolio to higher yielding mortgage backed securities 
our investments in mortgage backed securities are issued or guaranteed by us government agencies or government sponsored agencies 
investment securities held to maturity  consisting primarily of tax exempt municipal bonds  totaled million at december   compared to million at december  and million at december  the balance continues to decline because there were only maturities and no purchases of investment securities held to maturity during and we do not typically invest in structured notes or other derivative securities

provision for credit losses and risk management originating loans involves a degree of risk that credit losses will occur in varying amounts according to  among other factors  the types of loans being made  the credit worthiness of the borrowers over the term of the loans  the quality of the collateral for the loan  if any  as well as general economic conditions 
the company s board of directors demands accountability of management  keeping the interests of shareholders in focus 
through the company s and banks asset liability management committees and the company s audit committee  the board actively reviews critical risk positions  including credit  market  liquidity and operational risk 
the company s goal in managing risk is to reduce earnings volatility  control exposure to unnecessary risk  and ensure appropriate returns for risk assumed 
senior members of management actively manage risk at the product level  supplemented with corporate level oversight through the asset liability management committee and internal audit function 
the risk management structure is designed to identify risk issues through a systematic process  enabling timely and appropriate action to avoid and mitigate risk 
credit risk is mitigated through loan portfolio diversification  limiting exposure to any single industry or customer  collateral protection and standard lending policies and underwriting criteria 
the following discussion provides information and statistics on the overall quality of the company s loan portfolio 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the accounting policies related to nonperforming loans nonaccrual  delinquent days or more and troubled debt restructurings and loan charge offs and describes the methodologies used to develop the allowance for credit losses  including the specific  formula and nonspecific components also discussed below 
management believes the policies governing nonperforming loans and charge offs are consistent with regulatory standards 
the amount of the allowance for credit losses and the resulting provision are reviewed monthly by senior members of management and approved quarterly by the board of directors 
the allowance is increased by provisions for credit losses charged to expense and recoveries of loans previously charged off 
it is decreased by loans charged off in the current period 
loans  or portions thereof  are charged off when considered uncollectible 
provisions for credit losses are made to bring the allowance for credit losses within the range of balances that are considered appropriate based on the results of the allowance methodology and to reflect losses within the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is determined based on management s estimate of the inherent risks associated with lending activities  estimated fair value of collateral  past experience and present indicators such as loan delinquency trends  nonaccrual loans and current market conditions 
management believes the allowance is adequate to provide for probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio  however  future changes in the composition of the loan portfolio and financial condition of borrowers may result in additions to the allowance 
examination of the portfolio and allowance by various regulatory agencies and consultants engaged by the company may result in the need for additional provisions based on information available at the time of the examination 
each of the banks maintains a separate allowance for credit losses  which is only available to absorb losses from their respective loan portfolios 
the allowance set by each of the banks is subject to regulatory examination and determination as to its adequacy 
the allowance for credit losses is comprised of three parts the specific allowance  the formula allowance and the nonspecific allowance 
the specific allowance is established against impaired loans until charge offs are made 
loans are considered impaired ie  nonaccrual loans and accruing troubled debt restructurings when it is probable that the company will not collect all principal and interest payments according to the loan s contractual terms 
the formula allowance is determined based on management s assessment of industry trends and economic factors in the markets in which we operate 
the determination of the formula allowance involves a higher risk of uncertainty and considers current risk factors that may not have yet manifested themselves in our historical loss factors 
the nonspecific allowance captures losses that have impacted the portfolio but have yet to be recognized in either the specific or formula allowance 
the specific allowance is used to individually allocate an allowance to loans identified as impaired 
an impaired loan may involve deficiencies in the borrower s overall financial condition  payment history  support available from financial guarantors and or the fair market value of collateral 
if it is determined that there is a loss associated with an impaired loan  a specific allowance is established until a charge off is made 
impaired loans  or portions thereof  are charged off when deemed uncollectible 
the formula allowance is used to estimate the loss on internally risk rated loans  exclusive of those identified as impaired 
loans that are identified as special mention  substandard and doubtful are adversely rated 
these loans are assigned higher allowance factors than favorably rated loans due to management s concerns regarding collectability or management s knowledge of particular elements regarding the borrower 
loans that are favorably rated are grouped by type commercial real estate and construction  residential real estate  commercial or consumer 
each loan type is assigned an allowance factor based on management s estimate of the risk  complexity and size of individual loans within a particular category 
the nonspecific allowance is used to estimate the loss on loans stemming from more global factors such as delinquencies  loss history  trends in volume and terms of loans  effects of changes in lending policy  the experience and depth of management  national and local economic trends  concentrations of credit  the quality of the loan review system and the effect of external factors such as competition and regulatory requirements 
the economic downturn has continued to materially impact our performance since the second half of because most of our loans are secured by real estate  persistent weaknesses in our local real estate market and construction industry  and lack of improvement in general economic conditions have had a material adverse effect on the credit quality and performance of our loan portfolio 
factors affecting the loan portfolio performance and our overall financial performance included higher provisions for credit losses  loan charge offs and nonperforming assets nonperforming loans and other real estate and other assets owned 
as seen in the table below  the allowance for credit losses was million  or of average outstanding loans and of total nonaccrual loans at december   compared to an allowance of million  or of average outstanding loans and of nonaccrual loans at december  although the allowance was relatively unchanged from year end to year end  the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of average loans increased 
at december   the allowance for credit losses was million  or of average outstanding loans and of nonaccrual loans 
the ratio of net charge offs to average loans was in  in and in the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of nonaccrual loans has declined in each of the last three years as a result of the increased volume of impaired nonaccrual loans 
when a loan is determined to be impaired  the uncollectible portion is charged off 
impaired nonaccrual loans were reduced by partial charge offs totaling million  or  of the unpaid principal balance at december   compared to million  or  at december  the provision for credit losses was million for  compared to million and million for and  respectively 
net loan charge offs totaled million in  million in and million in when comparing to  residential and commercial real estate were the two loan categories that reflected increases in charge offs 
when comparing to  all loan categories reflected increases in charge offs except for commercial real estate 
construction loans had the largest amount of charge offs in these losses primarily related to two significant construction loan relationships 
although credit quality has been negatively impacted by weak economic conditions  we continue to observe strong underwriting guidelines 
however  as management identifies problem loans  it quantifies and attempts to minimize losses and pursues loan workouts  which result in either mutually acceptable resolutions or the disposal of the problem loans 
in light of the impact that the recession has had on our loan quality over the past few years  we have been more focused in our efforts to dispose of existing problem loans in an attempt to improve our financial performance 
the historically low real estate values that we are experiencing delay this process

the amount of the provision is determined based on management s analysis of the portfolio  growth and changes in the condition of credits and their resultant specific loss allocations 
historically  we have experienced the majority of our losses in the commercial loan portfolio  which are typically not secured by real estate 
however  beginning in  the company experienced significantly higher losses on real estate secured loans due to declining real estate values and the economic downturn 
included in the balance of the allowance for credit losses were specific reserves of million  thousand and thousand at the end of  and  respectively 
these specific reserves were primarily for residential real estate loans at year end and  and commercial loans at year end as seen in the table below  the unallocated portion of the allowance for credit losses was a fairly small percent of the total allowance with thousand at december   thousand at december  and thousand at december  as stated previously  most of our loans are secured by real estate with the portfolio comprised of construction  residential real estate and commercial real estate at december  that compares to  and  respectively  at december  and  and  respectively  at december  the following table sets forth the allocation of the allowance for credit losses and the percentage of loans in each category to total loans for the years ended december of of of of of dollars in thousands amount loans amount loans amount loans amount loans amount loans construction    residential real estate   commercial real estate   commercial    consumer unallocated total    nonperforming assets were million  million and million at december   and  respectively

see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the changes in the balances of nonaccrual loans and troubled debt restructurings 
for  total nonperforming loans increased million  primarily in nonaccrual real estate loans and troubled debt restructurings  and other real estate and other assets owned increased million 
from year end to year end  the increase in nonaccrual loans was primarily in construction loans that related largely to two borrowing relationships while the increase in troubled debt restructurings reflected a rise in concessionary workouts relating to problem loans

our principal market risk is interest rate risk that arises from our lending  investing and deposit taking activities 
our profitability is largely dependent on the banks net interest income 
interest rate risk can significantly affect net interest income to the degree that interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice at different intervals than interest earning assets 
the company s and banks asset liability management committees oversee the management of interest rate risk 
the primary purpose of these committees is to manage the exposure of net interest margins to unexpected changes due to interest rate fluctuations 
these efforts affect our loan pricing and deposit rate policies as well as asset mix  volume guidelines  and liquidity and capital planning 
during  the company began using derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to changes in interest rates 
the company does not use derivatives for any trading or other speculative purposes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on hedging activities 
because we are not exposed to market risk from trading activities and do not use off balance sheet management strategies  the asset liability management committees of the company and banks rely on gap analysis as its primary tool in managing interest rate risk 
gap analysis summarizes the amount of interest sensitive assets and liabilities  which will reprice over various time intervals 
the excess between the volume of assets and liabilities repricing in each interval is the interest sensitivity gap 
positive gap occurs when more assets reprice in a given time interval  while negative gap occurs when more liabilities reprice 
at december   as seen in the table below  we had an overall negative gap position within the one year repricing interval because the interest sensitive liabilities exceeded the interest sensitive assets within the one year repricing interval by million  or of total assets 
the negative gap position within the one year interval at december  totaled million  or of total assets  similar to the negative gap position at the end of the negative gap position within the one year interval at december   totaled million  or of total assets 
the million decrease in the one year negative gap for when compared to was primarily due to fewer time deposits in the one year interval gap at the end of than at the end of which was attributable to management reducing rates on time deposits 
the following table summarizes our interest sensitivity at december  loans  federal funds sold  time deposits and short term borrowings are classified based on contractual maturities if fixed rate or earliest repricing date if variable rate 
investment securities are classified by contractual maturities or  if they have call provisions  by the most likely repricing date

the model takes into consideration the effect of call features of investment securities as well as prepayments of loans in periods of declining rates 
the chart below summarizes the forecasted results provided by the simulation model for net interest income and the fair value of capital as of year end and for example  the model projects that  compared with net interest income under stable rates  net interest income would increase if interest rates increased basis points 
conversely  net interest income would decrease if interest rates decreased basis points 
when actual changes in interest rates occur  the changes in interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities may differ from the assumptions used in the model 
due to the low interest rate environment  we believe the results of the minus basis point change in rates are not meaningful

these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
the banks exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to these financial instruments is represented by the contractual amount of the instruments 
the banks use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as they use for on balance sheet instruments 
the banks generally require collateral or other security to support the financial instruments with credit risk 
the amount of collateral or other security is determined based on management s credit evaluation of the counterparty 
the banks evaluate each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the banks to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
letters of credit and other commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
because many of the letters of credit and commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
further information about these arrangements is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
management does not believe that any of the foregoing arrangements have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
liquidity management liquidity describes our ability to meet financial obligations that arise during the normal course of business 
liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of customers and to fund current and planned expenditures 
liquidity is derived through increased customer deposits  maturities in the investment portfolio  loan repayments and income from earning assets 
to the extent that deposits are not adequate to fund customer loan demand  liquidity needs can be met in the short term funds markets 
we have arrangements with correspondent banks whereby we have million available in federal funds lines of credit and a reverse repurchase agreement available to meet any short term needs which may not otherwise be funded by the banks portfolio of readily marketable investments that can be converted to cash 
the banks are also members of the fhlb  which provides another source of liquidity  and had credit availability of approximately million from the fhlb as of december  further information is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   our loan to deposit ratio was approximately  which represents a more liquid position than the and at year end and  respectively 
during  we began participating in the ind program which increased liquidity 
investment securities available for sale totaling million at the end of were available for the management of liquidity and interest rate risk 
the comparable amounts were million and million at december  and  respectively 
cash and cash equivalents were million at december   compared to million at year end and million at year end overall  we were in a more liquid position at the end of than we were at the end of our liquidity position at the end of was similar to that at the end of management is not aware of any demands  commitments  events or uncertainties that will materially affect our ability to maintain liquidity at satisfactory levels 
we have various financial obligations  including contractual obligations and commitments that may require future cash payments
