summary of consolidated results of operations condensed revenue and income information follows year ended december  premium earned investment income realized investment gains other income total revenues net loss income net loss income per share for the year ended december   total revenues were  compared to  for the same period last year  a decrease of 
a decrease in earned premium in the p c segment along with a decline in net realized investment gains were the primary contributing factors to the decrease in total revenue for over the company ended the year with a net loss totaling  compared to net income of  in the company ended with a net loss per share of compared to net income per share of in a increase in policyholder benefits was the primary factor contributing to the net loss in the current year 
for the year  policyholder benefits were of earned premium compared to in  an increase of percentage points 
losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in the p c segment from increased storm activity during combined with losses and adjustment expenses from an automobile program were the primary reasons for the increase compared to the same period last year 
results of operations for years ended december  and the company ended with premiums earned totaling  compared to  for the same period last year 
premium revenue is generated from our two operating segments p c segment and life segment 
the p c segment accounts for approximately of total premium revenue while our life segment contributes the remaining 
the p c segment operates in personal lines insurance products primarily generating premium revenue from dwelling fire  allied lines and homeowners policies 
our life segment produces premium revenue primarily from whole life  accident and critical illness insurance policies 
net investment income totaled  in compared to  in  a decrease 
the primary reason for the decline in investment income was the decrease in invested assets in compared to the same period last year 
the company ended with invested assets of  compared to  in  a or  decrease 
the decline was primarily related to selling of securities from our investment portfolio in to raise cash for claim payments from increased tornado and windstorm activity in the spring of in addition to the decline in invested assets  the subsidiaries continue to reinvest matured investments at interest rates substantially below the average book yield of the total portfolio 
this trend will continue as long as the current record low interest rate environment persists and will continue to put downward pressure on investment income 

table of contents net realized investment gains totaled  in compared to  in  a decrease of 
negatively impacting realized investment gains was  in other than temporary impairments recognized in the bond portfolio 
however  these impairments were offset by realized gains stemming from recoveries of previously recognized other than temporary impairments totaling  the primary reason for the decline in net realized investment income in compared to was management s decision to sell fewer securities due to market conditions 
other income was  for the period ended december  compared to  for the same period last year  a  decrease 
other income consists primarily of billing  payment and policy fees related to the issuance of our property and automobile insurance policies in the p c segment as well as other  primarily non recurring  miscellaneous income 
the primary reason for the decrease was a decline in fee income related to a reduction in policy issuance in the automobile program in the p c segment during compared to policyholder benefits paid claims increased  ending at  compared to  for the same period last year 
claims as a percentage of net premiums earned totaled for compared to in the primary reason for the  increase was higher claims activity in the p c segment associated with an increase in storm activity during coupled with increased claims in the automobile line of business 
the gross losses and loss adjustment expenses lae incurred in the p c segment from claims associated with storm systems classified as catastrophic referred to as cat events hereafter  totaled  in compared to  in the current year claims were incurred from seventeen separate cat events and accounted for of total claims during the year compared to of claims from ten cat events during the prior year 
prior to april  the single worst tornadic outbreak affecting the p c segment occurred in april and produced  in incurred losses and incurred lae for that month 
in comparison  the tornado and windstorms during the month of april produced incurred losses and incurred lae totaling  which was over eight times worse than the april storms 
a cat event on april th th  catastrophe was the primary source of the overall losses and lae incurred during april the incurred losses and lae from this single cat event totaled  or of the total claims reported during the month of april in the current year 
the p c segment maintains catastrophe reinsurance to reduce risk associated with losses from cat events 
the reinsurance is structured with a  deductible with coinsurance retained on the first two layers of coverage 
any claim activity exceeding the first two layers is reinsured up to  in ultimate incurred losses and lae 
because the p c segment incurred losses and lae from catastrophe that exceeded the reinsurance deductible  the p c segment recovered  from reinsurers 
the p c segment retained  of the incurred losses and incurred lae from catastrophe in addition to the incurred losses and lae from cat events  we also incurred significant losses and adjustment expenses from our automobile program 
the automobile program added an additional  to claims during and  during this program had loss ratios of and  respectively for the year ended december  and when coupled with commission and general expenses  the pre tax underwriting losses were in excess of  for both years 
the company discontinued the automobile program in the fourth quarter of the discontinuance of the automobile program is expected to positively impact overall underwriting results provided we do not experience any further adverse development on reported claims  many of which are liability coverage claims which tend to take longer to settle 
amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs dac and commissions totaled  compared to  for the same period last year  an increase of  dac and commission expenses were of premium revenue before cat reinstatement premium in compared to for the same period last year 
the primary reason for the increase was a higher contingent commission accrual in the current year compared to the prior year 
general and administrative expenses decreased  in compared to the same period last year 
general expenses were down primarily due to various cost saving measures implemented during the year coupled with an overall decline in revenue 
with the discontinuation of the automobile program in late  further reductions in general expenses in the insurance subsidiaries are expected in taxes  licenses and fees were  in  down compared to  for the same period last year 
the primary reason for the decrease was the reduction in expenses paid in related to insurance examination

for  the home service and independent agent distribution methods accounted for and  respectively of nsic premium revenue 
nsic ended with premium revenue of  compared to  for the same period last year  a decrease of 
the  decrease in premium revenue was primarily due to the decline in ordinary business related to the independent agent distribution method 
the home service distribution method also contributed to the overall decline in premium revenue ending down compared to the same period last year 
net investment income was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the same period last year 
investment income in nsic is generated from securities held in our investment portfolio as well as mortgage and policy loan interest 
the  or decrease was primarily attributable to a decline in average portfolio yield due to historically low interest rates 
nsic ended with net realized investment gains totaling  compared to  in although nsic recognized  in other than temporary impairment losses on two securities in the current year  we also had recoveries from previously recognized other than temporary impairments totaling  nsic did not recognize any other than temporary impairment losses during the primary reason for the decline in net realized investment income in compared to was management s decision to sell fewer securities 
this decision was based on an evaluation of current market conditions 
policyholder claims decreased  ending at  compared to  for the same period last year

furthermore  the p c segment incurred  in catastrophe reinstatement premium ceded during  accounting for three percentage points of the decrease compared to 
table of contents production of premium revenue in the p c segment is primarily driven by our dwelling fire  allied lines and homeowner lines of business 
the following table provides premiums earned by line of business line of business premium earned of npe premium earned of npe increase decrease over dwelling fire allied lines homeowners ocean marine private passenger automobile commercial automobile reinsurance ceded reinstatement premium net premium earned in our fire  allied lines and homeowner lines of business  we have slowed our rate of growth through a combination of rate increases  stricter underwriting standards and fewer appointments of new agents 
we have also limited production of new business in areas in which we have larger concentrations of risk in order to better manage the severity of catastrophe events 
these measures have been undertaken in an effort to improve underwriting profitability  particularly in our homeowners line of business 
the implementation of the above mentioned changes was the primary reason for the decrease in homeowners premium revenue in compared to due to continued underwriting losses in our private passenger automobile line of business  the program was terminated during the fourth quarter of the combination of previously implemented rate increases  which slowed the rate of new business growth  and ultimate termination of the program lead to the decrease in premium revenue in this line of business for compared to the same period last year 
the commercial automobile program was also evaluated  and based on poor underwriting results in the current period and previous years  this program was also terminated during net premium earned from this program was down  or compared to the same period last year 
the catastrophe event in late april  which exceeded our single event retention  triggered additional ceded premium payments reinstatement premium in order to reinstate coverage under our catastrophe reinsurance agreement 
as mentioned above  this catastrophe reinstatement premium was  and decreased the p c segment net premium earned three percentage points in we maintain a catastrophe reinsurance agreement in the p c segment to cover losses related to a cat event exceeding our deductible of  details regarding the structure of this agreement can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
net investment income totaled  in compared to  in  a decrease of  the decrease in investment income in the p c segment was primarily attributable to an  decline in invested assets in compared to the decrease in invested assets was driven by selling of securities during the first half of in order to increase liquidity for the payment of storm claims incurred during the spring storm season of the p c segment ended with realized capital gains totaling  compared to  for the same period last year 
the primary reason for the decline in realized capital gains was a reduction in selling activity in the current year compared to the same period last year 
the p c segment was not impacted by the write down of other than temporary impairments in or other income was  in compared to  for the same period last year  a  decrease 
other income consists primarily of fees related to the issuance of our property and automobile insurance policies as well as miscellaneous income 
the primary reason for the  decrease was policy fee income related to the automobile program 
the fees associated with the automobile business totaled  in compared to  in  a decrease of  the decrease in policy fees associated with the automobile line of business accounted for of the total decrease in other income in compared to claims were  in  up  from  for the same period last year 
the primary reasons 
table of contents for the increase were losses from tornado  wind and hail related weather events as well as claims associated with our automobile line of business 
the gross losses and adjustment expenses incurred in the p c segment from claims associated with cat events during totaled  these claims were incurred from seventeen separate cat events and accounted for of p c segment claims during the current year 
in comparison  the p c segment incurred gross losses and adjustment expenses from ten cat events during totaling  or of p c segment claims during the prior year 
the property claims service pcs classifies storms and other weather related events that exceed million in insured losses  on an industry wide basis  as a catastrophic event 
the p c segment was heavily affected by these catastrophic storm systems during  primarily in the month of april 
the storm activity in april was primarily tornado  wind and hail related  and was ranked the most active tornado month on record and caused widespread damage in the southeast united states 
according to statistics from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa  the april storms spawned tornadoes and caused an estimated fatalities the previous record for tornadoes incurred in a one month period was set in april with tornadoes 
the most significant of the april storm systems swept across mississippi  alabama and georgia from april th th  this storm system classified as catastrophe by pcs was by far the largest during april and created  in incurred losses and lae in the p c segment in while this event was covered by our catastrophe reinsurance coverage  we incurred significant costs associated with deductibles and reinstatement premium 
in our catastrophe reinsurance model results  which we utilize to establish reinsurance coverage limits  this tornado event exceeded a one in year return period  which means that this event had a probability of occurrence in the models of less than four tenths of one percentage point in any given year 
as mentioned previously  the p c segment incurred losses from all april cat events totaling  from  claims 
the losses and lae incurred from the cat events in april were over eight times higher than claims related to cat events during any prior one month period ever experienced by the p c companies 
the losses from the cat event from april th th  catastrophe  which contributed  or of the april incurred losses and lae  exceeded our  deductible for reinsurance  therefore  we recovered just under  from reinsurers 
on a net of reinsurance basis  the claims retained by the p c segment from catastrophe totaled  we routinely evaluate our claims frequency and severity statistics in order to better understand the nature of our risks and aid in the loss reserve liability evaluation process 
claims frequency is a measure of the number of claims incurred during a measurement period regardless of amount 
claims severity is a measure of the average dollar amount of claims during a measurement period 
the p c companies incurred  claims from seventeen cat events in compared to claims from ten cat events in the average severity per claim related to the seventeen non hurricane cat events affecting the p c companies during was  compared to  per claim from the ten non hurricane cat events in the magnitude of the cat events lead to the increase in severity per claim compared to the average severity per claim related to the tornado outbreak on april th th   catastrophe  was  and contributed significantly to skewing s average severity upward 
the personal lines automobile program ended with incurred losses and incurred loss adjustment expenses of  compared to  for the same period last year  a decrease of  although incurred losses were down in compared to  net premium earned was also down 
the loss ratio for the automobile program was for the year ended december  compared to for the same period last year and was the primary reason for incurred underwriting losses in excess of  in each year 
because of the year over year underwriting losses and significant claim activity associated with this program  the decision was made to terminate the program during the fourth quarter of the automobile policies are six month coverage periods  therefore  we expect the business to run off quickly 
the discontinuance of the automobile program  while contributing to a further decline in premium revenue  is expected to positively impact overall underwriting results provided we do not experience any further adverse development on reported claims  many of which are liability coverage claims which tend to take longer to settle 
the p c segment continued to be involved in litigation pertaining to claims from hurricane katrina which impacted our coverage areas in louisiana and mississippi in august the cumulative claims associated with hurricane katrina exceeded the  million upper limit of the reinsurance agreement in effect during as of december   cumulative claims incurred related to hurricane katrina exceeded the reinsurance upper limit by  although the reinsurance for this catastrophe has been exhausted and the ultimate outcome of the remaining open claims is unknown  the company maintains adequate reserves for the remaining open claims based

deferred policy acquisition costs totaled  in compared to  in the deferred policy acquisition costs were of premium revenue for  up percentage points compared to of premium revenue for the same period last year 
deferred policy acquisition costs consist of amortization of previously capitalized distribution costs which are primarily commissions 
commission expense for was  of premium revenue compared to  of premium revenue for the same period last year 
the primary reason for the  or increase in commission expense during compared to was an increase in contingent commissions 
general and administrative expenses totaled  or of premium revenue in compared to  or of premium revenue  in the primary reason for the  increase in general and administrative expenses was an increase in professional and consulting related fees in the current year compared to the same period last year 
insurance taxes  licenses and fees were  in compared to  for the same period last year 
insurance taxes  licenses and fees were of premium revenue in  virtually unchanged compared to in the p c segment ended with a net loss of  compared to net income of  for the same period last year 
the primary reason for the net loss in the current year was the  increase in claims which resulted from the seventeen cat events in combined with the automobile incurred losses 
in addition  net premium revenue was down  in compared to the combination of declining revenue and increased claims led to the negative results in the current year compared to the prior year 
property casualty combined ratio a measure used to analyze a property casualty insurer s underwriting performance is the combined ratio 
it is the sum of two ratios a 
the loss and loss expense ratio  which measures losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred as a percentage of premium revenue 
b 
the underwriting expense ratio  which measures underwriting expenses incurred eg  agents commissions  premium taxes  and other administrative underwriting expenses as a percentage of premium revenue 
the results of these ratios for the past two years were loss and lae ratio underwriting expense ratio combined ratio maintaining a combined ratio below  which indicates that the company is making an underwriting profit  depends upon many factors including hurricane activity in the gulf of mexico and the southern atlantic coast  strict underwriting of risks  and adequate and timely premium rates 
a major hurricane hitting the coast of alabama  georgia  south carolina  mississippi  louisiana  or texas could cause the combined ratio to fluctuate materially from prior years 
the property and casualty subsidiaries maintain catastrophe reinsurance to minimize the effect of a major catastrophe  however  prohibitive catastrophe reinsurance costs associated with maintaining lower deductibles prevent us from further mitigating hurricane risks 
during  the p c segment experienced an increase of percentage points in the combined ratio compared to the primary reason for the increase was a  increase in incurred losses primarily from tornado  wind and hail related claims as well as incurred losses from the automobile program 
the cat events and automobile losses increased the current year combined ratio by and percentage points  respectively  compared to and percentage points  respectively in while cat events are unpredictable and beyond the control of management  measures have been taken to improve underwriting results in the p c segment 
the discontinuance of the private passenger and commercial automobile programs is expected to improve overall p c segment underwriting results pending no further adverse development related to currently reported claims 
management also continues to evaluate

general and administrative expenses totaled  compared to  for the same period last year  a decrease 
the expenses of nsg are primarily associated with the public listing of our stock  taxes and fees  and directors fees 
the single most significant recurring expense of nsg is interest expense associated with  in debt 
this debt is composed of two trust preferred securities offerings  the first being  issued in the december and the second being  issued in june the primary use for these proceeds was to add capital to the property and casualty subsidiaries following the hurricanes of and total interest expense for the group associated with these borrowings in both and was  the primary reason for the decline in general expenses in compared to was the change in director deferred compensation which reduced general expenses  in the current year compared to  in the prior year 
defense cost related to matters disclosed in note of the consolidated financial statements  was the most significant factor impacting general expenses in both and defense costs incurred in nsg for the year ended december  and totaled  of total general expenses and  of total general expenses  respectively 
investments the life insurance and property casualty subsidiaries primarily invest in highly liquid investment grade debt and equity securities 
the types of assets in which the company can invest are influenced by various state insurance laws which prescribe qualified investment assets 
while working within the parameters of these prescribed regulatory requirements as well as liquidity and capital needs  the company considers investment quality  investment return  asset liability matching and composition of the investment portfolio when choosing investments 
at december   the company s holdings in debt securities amounted to of total investments and of total assets 
the company utilizes the ratings of various nationally recognized statistical rating organizations when classifying fixed maturity investments by quality rating 
the most significant shift in quality ratings occurring in was the downgrade of us government debt by s p from their highest rating of aaa to aa 
moody s and fitch continued to carry us government debt at their highest rating throughout due to the split ratings of the major

management has evaluated each security in a significant unrealized loss position 
for the year ended december   the company realized  in other than temporary impairments 
most of the remaining unrealized losses in the fixed income portfolio  for which no impairment has been realized  are interest rate driven as opposed to credit quality driven and management believes no ultimate loss will be realized 
in evaluating whether or not the equity loss positions were other than temporary impairments  management evaluated financial information on each company and where available reviewed analyst reports from at least two independent sources 
based on a review of the available financial information  the prospect for future earnings of each company and consideration of the company s intent and ability to hold the securities until market values recovered  it was determined that the remaining securities in an accumulated loss position in the portfolio were temporary impairments

we own no commercial mortgage backed securities 
we also have no material direct exposure in sub prime mortgage loans in our private label rmbs portfolio 
the mortgage backed bonds are subject to risks associated with variable prepayments of the underlying mortgage loans 
prepayments cause those securities to have different actual maturities than were expected at the time of purchase 
securities that are purchased at a premium to par value and prepay faster than expected will incur a reduction in yield or loss 
securities that are purchased at a discount to par value and prepay faster than expected will generate an increase in yield or gain 
the degree to which a security is susceptible to either gains or losses is influenced by the difference between amortized cost and par value  the relative sensitivity of the underlying mortgages backing the assets to prepayments in a changing interest rate environment and the repayment priority of the securities in the overall securitization structure 
in order to minimize risk associated with prepayments on collateralized mortgage obligations  the company typically invests primarily in more predictable planned amortization class pac structures of cmo s and typically avoids investment in cmo s priced at significant premiums above par value 
as for the composition of the rmbs portfolio  agency mortgage backed securities compose and of the rmbs portfolio at december  and  respectively 
the remainder of the rmbs portfolio is composed of private label mortgage backed securities 
these securities consist primarily of conventional and year loans with an average borrower fico score at origination of we own no mortgage backed securities with direct exposure to subprime loans and less than of the rmbs portfolio is composed of loans subject to rate resets

investment portfolio income investment returns with respect to the investment portfolio for the years ended december  and follows year ended december  net investment income average current yield on investments total return on investments net realized gains on investments before taxes change in accumulated net unrealized gains before income taxes the decrease in current yield on investments is primarily due to the reinvestment of proceeds received from investment 
table of contents maturities at lower interest rates 
also impacting the decrease in net investment income was a reduction in float associated with the automobile program 
float in the insurance subsidiaries results from the investment of claim reserves and a portion of unearned premium reserves between the time insurance contract payments are received from the insured and claim obligations are settled 
repurchase agreements the company maintains a repurchase agreement under which the policy requires minimum of the fair value of the securities purchased to be maintained as collateral 
cash collateral received is invested in short term investments 
the repurchase investments are limited to government securities that are highly liquid 
the company does not have any reverse repurchase agreements 
liquidity and capital resources due to regulatory restrictions  the majority of the company s cash is required to be invested in investment grade securities to provide ample protection for policyholders 
the liabilities of the property and casualty insurance subsidiaries are of various terms and  therefore  those subsidiaries invest in securities with various effective maturities spread over periods usually not exceeding years 
the liabilities of the life insurance subsidiary are typically of a longer duration  and therefore  a higher percentage of securities in the life insurance subsidiary are invested for periods exceeding years 
the liquidity requirements for the company are primarily met by funds generated from operations of the life insurance and property casualty insurance subsidiaries 
all operations and virtually all investments are maintained by the insurance subsidiaries 
premium and investment income as well as maturities and sales of invested assets provide the primary sources of cash for both the life and property casualty businesses  while applications of cash are applied by both businesses to the payment of policy benefits  the cost of acquiring new business principally commissions  operating expenses  purchases of new investments  and in the case of life insurance  policy loans 
virtually all invested assets of the company are held in the insurance subsidiaries 
as of december   the maturity schedule for all bonds and notes held by the company  stated at amortized cost  was as follows dollars in thousands maturity available for sale held to maturity total percentage of total maturity in less than year maturity in years maturity in years maturity after years it should be noted that the above table represents maturities based on stated maturity 
due to call and prepayment features inherent in some debt securities  actual repayment  or effective maturities  will differ from stated maturities 
the company routinely evaluates the impact of changing interest rates on the projected maturities of bonds in the portfolio and actively manages the portfolio in order to minimize the impact of interest rate risk 
currently  for every basis point change in interest rates the company will incur a change in market price of the fixed income portfolio of approximately 
the national security group s consolidated statement of cash flows indicates that cash flow used in operating activities was  in compared to net cash flows provided by operating activities of  in the primary reasons for the decline in operating cash flow was a reduction in net income related to declines in earned premium and increased losses in the auto program coupled with catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premium incurred during the second quarter 
also largely associated with the catastrophe losses and the decline in cash flow from operations were increases in reinsurance recoverable of  and a decline in accrued income taxes totaling  cash flow provided by investing activities was  in compared to cash used of  in the prior year 
normally  our investment process allows for cash received from premiums  selling investments  principal receipts and funds received from calls to be reinvested 
however  due to the increased frequency of storm losses  primarily in the second quarter of  more proceeds from investments were used to cover increased operating cash flow

these calculations do not take into account any potential prepayments 
for additional information regarding long term debt and interest on long term debt  please see note  notes payable and long term debt  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the anticipated payout of property and casualty claim reserves  which includes loss and loss adjustment expenses  are based upon historical payout patterns 
both the timing and amount of these payments may vary from the payment indicated 
future life insurance obligations consist primarily of estimated future contingent benefit payments and surrender benefits on policies inforce at december  these estimated payments are computed using assumptions for future mortality  morbidity and persistency 
in contrast to this table  the majority of nsic s obligations is recorded on the balance sheet at the current account values and do not incorporate an expectation of future market growth  interest crediting or future deposits 
therefore  the estimated future life insurance obligations presented in this table significantly exceed the liabilities recorded in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
due to the significance of the assumptions used  the actual amount and timing of such payments may differ significantly from the estimated amounts 
management believes that current assets  future premiums and investment income will be sufficient to fund all future life insurance obligations 
included in long term debt held by the company is the issuance of  in subordinated debentures completed on december  the proceeds from the debentures were used to make a  capital infusion in the p c subsidiary national security fire and casualty with the remainder to be held for general corporate purposes 
the subordinated debentures mature december  it is anticipated that principal payments will not be made until the expiration of the fixed rate period on the debt in also included in long term debt is the issuance of  in subordinated debentures completed june  the proceeds from the debentures were used to fund general corporate expenses thereby reducing the amount of dividends to the group paid by the p c subsidiary national security fire casualty in and thereby continuing to restore capital in the p c subsidiary national security fire and casualty to pre hurricane levels 
the second issue matures june  and may be redeemed following the fifth anniversary of issuance 
in estimating the time interval for payment of property and casualty claim reserves  the company utilized historical payment patterns 
by the nature of the insurance contracts under which these liabilities exist  there can be no certainty that actual payments will fall in the periods indicated above 
however  management believes that current liquidity and capital resources are sufficient to pay these obligations as they come due 
also  due to the relatively short tail nature of the majority of the company s property and casualty claim liabilities  management can conclude with a reasonable level of confidence that historical patterns indicate that approximately of claim liabilities at the end of a given year are settled within the following two year period 
the ability of the company to meet its commitments for timely payment of claims and other expenses depends  in addition to current cash flow  on the liquidity of its investments 
the company has relatively little exposure to lower grade fixed income investments which might be especially subject to liquidity problems due to thinly traded markets 
as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements regarding contingencies  the company is involved in litigation related to the sale of mobile attic  inc as is customarily discussed in the management discussion and analysis  the company s liquidity requirements are primarily met by funds provided from operations of the insurance subsidiaries 
the company maintains minimal liquidity in order to maximize liquidity within the insurance subsidiaries 
table of contents in order to support ongoing insurance operations 
the company has no separate source of revenue other than dividends and fees from the insurance subsidiaries 
also  dividends from the insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulatory restrictions and  therefore  are limited depending on capital levels and earnings of the subsidiaries 
our p c segment  which composes the largest segment of our insurance operations  incurred substantial operating losses in these operating losses contributed to a decline of over in capital levels in the segment 
these reduced capital levels  while adequate to operate our existing business  have substantially reduced our ability to pay dividends upstream to the holding company in the near term 
we have also paid over  in defense related cost associated with the mobile attic litigation over the past two years with ultimate defense cost expected to exceed  before trial  set for june of this litigation related defense cost has further reduced cash reserves in the holding company 
in the event of a substantial adverse judgment related to the litigation against the company  we could face limitations in our ability to fund shareholder dividends and service interest payments on outstanding debt 
the uncertainty related to the pending litigation could also temporarily impair our ability to raise new debt or equity capital until this matter is resolved 
the company is vigorously defending the allegations raised in this litigation and is unable to determine a potential liability at this time which limits our ability to predict the ultimate impact on our liquidity and capital resources 
the company filed a claim for coverage under a liability policy having aggregate limits of  but the insurer has denied coverage and no provision for any recovery has been made in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements 
the company s subsidiaries require cash in order to fund policy acquisition costs  claims  other policy benefits  interest expense  general expenses  and dividends to the company 
premium and investment income  as well as maturities  calls  and sales of invested assets  provide the primary sources of cash for both subsidiaries 
a significant portion of the company s investment portfolio consists of readily marketable securities  which can be sold for cash 
the company s business is concentrated primarily in the southeastern united states 
accordingly  unusually severe storms or other disasters in the southeastern united states might have a more significant effect on the company than on a more geographically diversified insurance company 
however  the company s p c subsidiaries maintain a catastrophe reinsurance program to limit the effect of such catastrophic events on the company s financial condition 
the company s deductible under the terms of the reinsurance contract in place during totaled million  however  the company s p c subsidiaries maintained cash and short term investments in sufficient amounts to cover the deductible payment 
in the event of a major storm impacting the p c subsidiaries in  similar to the spring storm occurrence in  we could face further pressures and or limitations in the subsidiaries ability to pay dividends to the company which could force us to suspend dividend payments to shareholders and limit our ability to service interest payments on outstanding debt 
except as discussed above and in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company is aware of no known trends  events  or uncertainties reasonably likely to have a material effect on its liquidity  capital resources  or operations 
additionally  the company has not been made aware of any recommendations of regulatory authorities  which if implemented  would have such an effect 
as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  in  the amount that the national security group s insurance subsidiaries can transfer in the form of dividends to the parent company is limited to  in the life insurance subsidiary and  in the property casualty insurance subsidiary 
the payment of any subsidiary dividend requires prior notice to the regulatory authorities who may disallow the dividend if  in their judgment  payment of the dividend would have an adverse effect on the surplus of the subsidiary 
the company maintains an operating line of credit to allow flexibility with respect to cash management at the holding company level 
the outstanding balance at december  was  off balance sheet arrangements the company has no material off balance sheet arrangements 
statutory risk based capital of insurance subsidiaries 
table of contents the naic has adopted risk based capital rbc requirements for life health and property casualty insurance companies to evaluate the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus in relation to investment and insurance risks such as asset quality  mortality and morbidity  asset and liability matching  benefit and loss reserve adequacy  and other business factors 
state insurance regulators will use the rbc formula as an early warning tool to identify  for the purpose of initiating regulatory action  insurance companies that potentially are inadequately capitalized 
in addition  the formula defines minimum capital standards that will supplement the current system of low fixed minimum capital and surplus requirements on a state by state basis 
regulatory compliance is determined by a ratio of the company s regulatory total adjusted capital  as defined by the naic  to its authorized control level rbc  as defined by the naic 
companies below specific trigger points or ratios are classified within levels  each of which requires corrective action 
the levels and ratios are as follows ratio of total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc regulatory event less than or equal to company action level regulatory action level authorized control level mandatory control level the ratios of total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc for the national security group s life health and property casualty insurance subsidiaries are all in excess of to at december  national security insurance company life insurer has regulatory adjusted capital of million and million at december  and  respectively  and a ratio of regulatory total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc of and at december  and  respectively 
accordingly  national security insurance company exceeds the minimum rbc requirements 
national security fire casualty company property casualty insurer has regulatory adjusted capital of million and million at december  and  respectively  and a ratio of regulatory total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc of and at december  and  respectively 
accordingly  national security fire casualty company exceeds the minimum rbc requirements 
omega one insurance company property casualty insurer  which began writing business in late  has regulatory adjusted capital of million and million at december  and  respectively  and a ratio of regulatory total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc of and at december  and  respectively 
accordingly  omega one insurance company exceeds the minimum rbc requirements 
application of critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are based upon the development and application of accounting policies that require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
accounting policies may be based on including but not limited to gaap authoritative literature  statutory authoritative literature  regulations and industry standards 
the company s financial results would be directly impacted by changes in assumptions and judgments used to select and apply our accounting policies 
it is management s opinion that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in regards to the application of our accounting policies and their effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
reinsurance deferred policy acquisition costs income taxes fair values of financial instruments claim liabilities recognition of revenue 
table of contents contingencies recently issued accounting standards reinsurance risk management involves ceding risks to reinsurers for policies underwritten based on contractual agreements 
the reinsurance purchased helps provide protection by individual loss or catastrophic event when claims exceed specified amounts 
although the reinsurance protects our company in the event a loss penetrates into a particular reinsurance agreement  ultimate responsibility for claim settlement rests with our company if any reinsurer defaults on payments due 
we record an asset for reinsurance recoverable on the financials for amounts due from reinsurers and monitor the balances due by reinsurer to ensure the asset is ultimately going to be collectible 
if we discover an amount due may not be received  we remove the balance and charge it to an allowance for doubtful accounts or charge it off to expense based on the information available at the time 
when a claim is made under a policy we have reinsured  we initially pay the full amount owed to the policyholder or claimant 
subsequently  we initiate the process to recover any amounts due from reinsurers in accordance with the terms of applicable reinsurance treaties 
reinsurance is maintained by the life and accident and health segment for losses that exceed  for any one insured 
nsfc and omega generally reinsure with third parties any liability in excess of  on any single policy 
during  the property and casualty segment maintained a catastrophe contract which covered losses related to a catastrophic event with multiple policyholders affected 
in the event a catastrophe exceeded the million retention stated in the contract  reinsurers would reimburse the company co pay of gross losses and loss adjustment expenses paid up to million layer one and layer two of the contract 
if losses exceeded million  the contract allowed for reimbursement of losses and loss adjustment expenses up to million 
any losses above the million upper limit were the responsibility of our company 
the contract in place during also allowed one reinstatement for coverage under the contract for a second catastrophic event if needed 
the contract provided protection which exceeded a year near term event as depicted in catastrophe modeling results 
the near term catastrophe modeling results reflect a predicted increase in storm activity given the current weather pattern and various factors projected to impact our weather patterns in the near term 
at december   the estimated reinsurance recoverable recorded was  compared to  for the same period last year 
the company does not anticipate any issues with collection of the recorded amount 
in  catastrophe reinsurance premiums totaled  ceded compared to  in catastrophe reinsurance premiums are based on a premium calculation applying the agreed upon rate to the earned premium of the covered lines of business 
the decrease in ceded premium in is attributable to a decline in the premium base and a decline in the rate applied 
the reinsurance related amounts recorded have been estimated based upon management s interpretation of the related reinsurance treaty 
areas in which judgment has been used regarding said estimates include assessing the financial viability and credit quality of each reinsurer as well as the ability of each reinsurer to pay amounts owed 
there is a possibility that the actual amounts recovered from reinsurers could be materially less than the estimates recorded 
this possibility could result in a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
reinsurers may dispute claims under reinsurance treaties  such as the calculated amount of reinsurance recoverable 
management does not anticipate any issues with recoverability of reinsurance balances based on current evaluations of collectability 
for more information regarding reinsurance  see the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
deferred policy acquisition costs deferred policy acquisition costs dac are those costs incurred in connection with acquiring new business or renewing existing business 
dac is primarily comprised of commissions  premium taxes  and underwriting costs associated with issuing new policies 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  these costs are not expensed in their entirety at policy inception  rather  they are recorded as an asset and amortized over the lives of the policies 
a reduction in dac is recognized if the sum of the expected loss and loss adjustment expenses  unamortized acquisition costs  and maintenance costs exceeds related unearned premiums and projected investment income 
management reviews dac calculations throughout the year to establish and assess their recoverability 
changes in management s assumptions  estimates or judgment with respect to calculating dac could materially impact our financial statements 
table of contents and financial condition 
changes in loss ratios  projected investment income  premium rates or overall expense levels could negatively impact the recoverability of dac 
at december  and  the company recorded  and  respectively  as an asset for dac in the financial statements 
we do not foresee any issues related to recoverability of these capitalized costs 
for more information regarding deferred policy acquisition costs  see note to our financial statements 
income taxes the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
deferred income taxes arise from the recognition of temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of the company s assets and liabilities and operating loss carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or are settled 
a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period the new rate is enacted 
at december   there is no evidence to suggest to management that any deferred tax asset is unrealizable 
for more information regarding deferred income taxes  see note to our financial statements 
the company evaluates all tax positions taken on its us federal income tax return 
no material uncertainties exist for any tax positions taken by the company 
fair values of financial instruments investments are recorded at fair value based upon quoted prices when available 
quoted prices are available for most investment debt and equity securities included in the financial statements 
further discussion of fair value methodology is discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
periodically  the carrying values of an individual investment may become temporarily impaired because of time value  volatility  credit quality and existing market conditions 
management evaluates investments to determine whether the impairment is other than temporary 
evaluation criteria include credit quality of security  severity of decrease between cost and market value  length of time of the impairment and likelihood that the impairment will reverse in the near future 
this evaluation requires significant assumptions  estimates and judgments by management 
if the impairment is determined to be other than temporary  the investment is written down to the current fair value and a realized loss is recorded on the income statement 
we have very limited exposure to less liquid and difficult to value investments such as collateralized debt obligations 
claim liabilities property and casualty loss reserves are maintained to cover the estimated unpaid liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to reported and unreported incurred claims 
loss reserves are an estimation based on actuarial projection techniques common in the insurance industry 
reserves are management s expectations of what the settlement and administration of claims will cost 
management estimated reserves are based on historical settlement patterns  estimated salvage and subrogation  and an appraisal of the related facts and circumstances 
management s reserve estimates are reviewed by consulting actuaries to determine their adequacy and reasonableness 
the reserve analysis performed by management is reviewed by the actuaries during the third quarter each year with a final comprehensive review and actuarial sign off performed at year end 
at december  and  the recorded liability for loss and loss adjustment expense was  and  respectively  a  increase 
claim activity from catastrophe related losses combined with increased automobile claims were the primary factors contributing to the increase 
we believe the estimate of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses to be sufficient based on currently available information and a review of our historical reserving practices 
for more information regarding loss and loss adjustment expense  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
recognition of revenue life insurance premiums are recognized as revenues when due 
property and casualty insurance premiums include direct writings plus reinsurance assumed less reinsurance ceded and are recognized on a pro rata basis over the terms of the policies 
unearned premiums represent that portion of direct premiums written that are applicable to the unexpired terms of policies in force and is reported as a liability 
prepaid reinsurance premiums represent the unexpired portion of premiums ceded to reinsurers and is reported as an asset 
contingencies 
table of contents liabilities for loss contingencies arising from  but not limited to  litigation  claims  assessments  fines and penalties are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment and or remediation can be reasonably estimated 
additional details with respect to contingencies are disclosed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
recently issued accounting standards intangibles goodwill and other effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   the fasb revised guidance related to goodwill impairment testing 
the revised guidance clarifies that when evaluating goodwill associated with a reporting unit that has a zero or negative carrying value  an initial determination should be made as to whether it is more likely than not that the goodwill is impaired 
when impairment is more likely than not  the goodwill is required to be tested for impairment 
we adopted the guidance on january  adoption did not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
fair value measurements effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   the fasb revised guidance to require additional disclosure about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements in the roll forward activity in level fair value measurements 
we adopted the guidance on january   adoption did not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
accounting changes not yet adopted presentation of comprehensive income effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   the fasb revised guidance related to the way other comprehensive income oci appears within the financial statements 
companies will be required to show net income  oci and total comprehensive income in one continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements 
components of oci may no longer be presented solely in the statement of changes in shareholders equity 
any reclassification between oci and net income will be presented on the face of the financial statements 
we do not expect the impact of this revised guidance to change reported net income or comprehensive income upon adoption in fair value measurements effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   the fasb revised guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures  all of which are to be applied prospectively 
the new guidance increases disclosure requirements regarding valuation methods used to determine fair value measurements categorized as level  as well as the sensitivity to change of those measurements  and requires additional disclosures regarding the consideration given to highest and best use in fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets 
the guidance requires that when fair value measurements of items not carried at fair value are disclosed  the fair value measurements are to be categorized by level of fair value hierarchy 
additionally  the guidance also clarifies or revises certain fair value measurement principles related to the valuation of financial instruments managed within a portfolio  the valuation of instruments classified as a part of shareholders equity  the appropriate application of the highest and best use valuation premise  and the consideration of premium and discounts in a fair value measurement 
we are currently evaluating the impact of this revised guidance 
however  we do not expect a material effect on our results of operations or financial position upon adoption in accounting for costs associated with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts effective for fiscal years beginning after december   the fasb revised guidance regarding the interpretation of which costs relating to the acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts qualify for deferral 
the guidance permits deferral of qualifying costs associated only with successful contract acquisitions 
the portion of internal selling agent and underwriter salary and benefit costs allocated to unsuccessful contracts  as well as advertising costs  are excluded 
the guidance should be applied prospectively  but may be applied retrospectively for all prior periods 
we are currently evaluating the impact of this revised guidance on our financial statements 
however  we do not expect a material effect on our results of operations or financial position upon adoption in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
table of contents under smaller reporting company rules we are not required to disclose information required under item a 
however  in order to provide information to our investors  we have elected to provide information related to market risk 
the company s primary objectives in managing its investment portfolio are to maximize investment income and total investment returns while minimizing overall credit risk 
investment strategies are developed based on many factors including changes in interest rates  overall market conditions  underwriting results  regulatory requirements and tax position 
investment decisions are made by management and reviewed by the board of directors 
market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in fair value of securities 
the three potential risks related to the company s fixed maturity portfolio are interest rate risk  prepayment risk and default risk 
the primary risk related to the company s equity portfolio is equity price risk 
since the company s assets and liabilities are largely monetary in nature  the company s financial position and earnings are subject to risks resulting from changes in interest rates at varying maturities  changes in spreads over us treasuries on new investment opportunities and changes in the yield curve and equity pricing risks 
the company is exposed to equity price risk on its equity securities 
the company holds common stock with a fair value of million 
our portfolio has historically been highly correlated to the s p with regard to market risk 
based on an evaluation of the historical risk measure of our portfolio relative to the s p  if the market value of the s p index decreased from its december  value  the fair value of the company s common stock would decrease by approximately  certain fixed interest rate market risk sensitive instruments may not give rise to incremental income or loss during the period illustrated but may be subject to changes in fair values 
note and in the consolidated financial statements present additional disclosures concerning fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities and are incorporated by reference herein 
the company limits the extent of its market risk by purchasing securities that are backed by stable collateral  the majority of the assets are issued by us government sponsored entities 
also  the majority of all of the subsidiaries cmo s are planned amortization class pac bonds 
pac bonds are typically the lowest risk cmo s  and provide greater cash flow predictability 
such securities with reduced risk typically have a lower yield  but higher liquidity  than higher risk mortgage backed bonds 
to reduce the risk of losing principal should prepayments exceed expectations  the company does not purchase mortgage backed securities at significant premiums over par value 
the company s investment approach in the equity markets is based primarily on a fundamental analysis of value 
this approach requires the investment committee to invest in well managed  primarily dividend paying companies  which have a low debt to capital ratio  above average return on capital for a sustained period of time  and low volatility rating beta relative to the market 
the dividends provide a steady cash flow to help pay current claim liabilities  and it has been the company s experience that by following this investment strategy  long term investment results have been superior to those offered by bonds  while keeping the risk of loss of capital to a minimum relative to the overall equity market 
as for shifts in investment allocations  the company has moderately increased allocations to corporate and tax free bonds 
the improved yield spreads on corporate bonds has made this segment more attractive and the risk of investing in corporate bonds versus government bonds is more appropriately priced in our opinion 
we have also increased our allocation to tax free securities to further enhance after tax returns given our improved earnings performance over the last two years
