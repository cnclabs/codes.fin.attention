item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto that follow in this annual report on form k 
overview historically  our quantitative radio ratings services and related software have accounted for a substantial majority of our revenue 
our quantitative radio ratings services and related software accounted for approximately percent of our total revenue in each of the years ended december    and we have one segment which meets the quantitative thresholds for being a reportable segment 
while we expect our quantitative radio ratings services and related software licensing will continue to account for the majority of our revenue for the foreseeable future  we are actively seeking opportunities to diversify our revenue base by  among other things  leveraging the investment we have made in our ppm ratings service and technology 

table of contents we have commercialized our ppm ratings service in of the largest united states radio markets 
we may choose to commercialize our ppm ratings service in additional markets in the future 
these agreements provide for a higher fee for ppm based ratings than we charged for our diary based ratings 
our customer contracts are typically structured to phase in higher ppm service rates over multiple years  including for some customers 
as we commercialized the ppm ratings service over several years  we incurred expenses to build the ppm panel in each ppm market in the months before commercializing the service in that market 
these costs were incremental to the costs associated with our diary based ratings service during those periods 
with the completion of our previously announced commercialization plan as of december   our future performance will be impacted by our ability to address a variety of challenges and opportunities in the markets and industries we serve  including our ability to continue to maintain and improve the quality of our ppm and diary ratings service  and manage increased costs for data collection  arising among other ways  from address based sampling  targeted in person recruiting and increased numbers of cell phone households  which are more expensive for us to recruit than households with landline phones 
we currently anticipate that the aggregate cost of cell phone household recruitment for the ppm and diary services  address based sampling in ppm markets  and targeted in person recruitment for the ppm service will be approximately million in  as compared to approximately million in in addition  we are currently subject to us and international data protection and privacy statutes  rules  and regulations  and may in the future become subject to additional such statutes  rules  and regulations 
complying with these laws may require us to make certain investments  make modifications to existing services  or prohibit us from offering certain types of services  any of which may be material and adversely impact our financial results 
failing to comply could result in civil and criminal liability  negative publicity  data being blocked from use  and liability under contracts with our customers  vendors  and partners 
zokem oy on july   we acquired zokem oy  a finland based mobile audience measurement and analytics firm  which is now arbitron mobile oy 
the purchase price for the acquisition was approximately million in cash plus a contingent consideration arrangement which we currently estimate has a fair value of approximately million 
the arrangement provides for possible additional cash payments to be made by us to the former zokem shareholders through of up to million  contingent upon arbitron mobile reaching certain future financial performance targets 
credit facility on november   the company terminated its credit facility agreement originally signed on december   which was scheduled to expire on december  credit facility 
there were no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility at the time of the termination 
also  on november   the company entered into a new agreement with a consortium of lenders to provide up to million of financing through a five year  unsecured revolving credit facility expiring on november  the agreement contains an expansion feature to increase the total financing available by up to million to an aggregate of million 
see liquidity and capital resources credit facility below for further information regarding the terms of our current credit facility agreement 
general economic conditions many of our customers derive most of their revenue from transactions involving the sale or purchase of advertising 
during recent challenging economic times  advertisers have reduced advertising expenditures  impacting advertising agencies and media 
as a result  advertising agencies and media companies have been and may continue to be less likely to purchase our services  which has and could continue to adversely impact our business  financial position  and operating results 
if the recovery from the recent economic downturn slows or if the economy experiences another downturn in the foreseeable future  it may also lead to an increase of incidences of customers inability to pay their accounts  an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts  and a further increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or insolvency of our customers 
we depend on a limited number of key customers for our ratings services and related software 
for example  in  clear channel represented approximately percent of our total revenue 
additionally  although the amount of contract term revenue associated with customer contracts expiring in is lower  as compared to historical standards  if one or more key customers do not renew all or part of their contracts as they expire  we could experience a significant decrease in our operating results 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies and estimates are those that are both important to the presentation of our financial position or results of operations  and require our most difficult  complex or subjective judgments 
software development costs 
we capitalize software development costs with respect to significant internal use software initiatives or enhancements from the time the preliminary project stage is completed and management considers it probable the software will be used to perform the function intended  until the time the software is placed in service for its intended use 
once the software is placed in service  the capitalized costs are amortized over periods of three to five years 
we perform an assessment quarterly to determine if it is probable all capitalized software will be used to perform its intended function 
if an impairment exists  the software cost is written down to estimated fair value 
as of december   and  our capitalized software developed for internal use had carrying amounts of million and million  respectively  including million and million  respectively  of software related to the ppm service 
deferred income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
we must make assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine the current provision for income taxes and also deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset 
our assumptions  judgments  and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws  interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by domestic and foreign tax authorities 
changes in tax law or interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in the consolidated financial statements 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account forecasts of the amount and nature of future taxable income 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and nature of income in future years could render current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred tax assets inaccurate 
we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deferred tax assets 
any of the assumptions  judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause actual income tax obligations to differ from estimates  thus impacting our financial position and results of operations 
we include  in our tax calculation methodology  an assessment of the uncertainty in income taxes by establishing recognition thresholds for our tax positions 
inherent in our calculation are critical judgments by management related to the determination of the basis for our tax positions 
for further information regarding our unrecognized tax benefits  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k 
insurance receivables 
during  we became involved in two securities law civil actions and a governmental interaction primarily related to the commercialization of our ppm service 
since  we have incurred a total of million in legal fees and expenses in connection with these matters 
as of december   we have received an aggregate of million in insurance reimbursements related to these legal fees and expenses 
as of december   and  our insurance claims receivable related to these legal actions was approximately million and million  respectively  and these amounts are included in our prepaid expenses and other current assets on our balance sheet 
see note in our notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning our insurance recovery receivables 
cost method investment 
we account for our investment in tra s preferred stock using the cost method of accounting 
tra is closely held and there is not an efficient market in which buyers and sellers determine the fair value of these securities 
we periodically assess the fair value of our investment in tra through comparative analysis and analysis of tra s actual and projected financial results 
our assessment of the fair value of tra requires the use of estimates and judgment 
during the fourth quarter ended december   we determined that the fair value of our investment in tra fell below its carrying value and we recorded a million impairment charge 
contingent consideration 
the agreement governing the acquisition of zokem oy  now arbitron mobile oy  provides for possible additional cash payments to be made by us to the former zokem shareholders through of up to million  contingent upon arbitron mobile reaching certain financial performance targets in the future 
we estimated the fair value of this contingent consideration to be approximately million as of the july  acquisition date 
we periodically estimate the fair value of the contingent consideration and any change in fair value will be recognized in our consolidated financial results of operations 
an increase in the earn out expected to be paid will result in a charge to operations in the quarter the anticipated fair value of contingent consideration increases  while a decrease in the earn out expected to be paid will result in a credit to operations in the quarter the anticipated fair value of contingent consideration decreases 
the estimate of the fair value of contingent consideration requires subjective assumptions to be made of future operating results 
we estimated that the fair value of the earn out decreased less than million during the period from the date of acquisition to december  future revisions to these assumptions could materially change our estimate of the fair value of contingent consideration and therefore materially affect our future financial results and financial condition

table of contents revenue 
revenue increased by or million for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in ppm based ratings service revenue increased by million primarily due to a full year impact for the ppm markets commercialized during  as well as price escalators in other ppm markets commercialized prior to in addition  revenue for was impacted by a million increase in software service revenue  and a million increase in ppm international revenue 
these increases in revenue were partially offset by a million decrease in revenue related to the transition from our diary based ratings service 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue increased by or million for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in cost of revenue increased primarily due to a million increase related to our computer center operations  a million increase in labor costs  a million increase in ppm related costs  a million increase in cross platform services costs  a million increase in ppm international costs  and million associated with our arbitron mobile service acquired during the third quarter of these increases in cost of revenue were partially offset by a million decrease for diary based service costs related primarily to the corresponding reduction in the number of diary markets 
selling  general  and administrative 
selling  general  and administrative increased by or million for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in selling  general  and administrative increased primarily due to million in arbitron mobile related costs and expenses incurred during  a million increase in share based and long term employee incentive compensation expense  a million increase in short term employee incentive compensation expense  and a million increase in bad debt expense incurred in as compared to these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in employee separation charges  and a million supplemental retirement plan settlement charge incurred during  but not in research and development 
research and development decreased by or million for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in research and development decreased primarily due to a million reduction in development costs related to our diary service  partially offset by a million increase in labor and royalty costs associated with acquisition of assets from immi  which was completed during the second quarter of  and million in arbitron mobile related costs and expenses incurred during see note in our notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning our acquisitions 
impairment of investment 
during the fourth quarter ended december   we determined that the fair value of our investment in tra fell below its carrying value and we recorded a million pre tax impairment charge 
no such impairment charge was recorded in income tax expense 
income tax expense increased by or million for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in the effective tax rate increased from in to in primarily due to a valuation allowance with respect to the us deferred tax asset arising from the net operating loss incurred by arbitron mobile 
ebit and ebitda 
we believe presenting ebit and ebitda  both non gaap financial measures  as supplemental information helps investors  analysts and others  if they so choose  understand and evaluate our operating performance in some of the same ways we do because ebit and ebitda exclude certain items not directly related to our core operating performance 
we reference these non gaap financial measures in assessing current performance and making decisions about internal budgets  resource allocation and financial goals 
ebit is calculated by deducting interest income from net income and adding back interest expense and income tax expense to net income 
ebitda is calculated by deducting interest income from net income and adding back interest expense  income tax expense  and depreciation and amortization to net income 
ebit and ebitda margins are calculated as percentages of revenue 
ebit and ebitda should not be considered substitutes either for net income  as indicators of our operating performance  or for cash flow  as measures of our liquidity 
in addition  because ebit and ebitda may not be calculated identically by all companies  the presentation here may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
ebit increased by or million for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in  primarily due to higher revenue from ppm price escalators in ebitda increased by or million because this non gaap financial measure excludes depreciation and amortization  which for increased by million as compared to

revenue 
revenue increased by or million for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in primarily due to higher fees charged for ppm based ratings than for diary based ratings within the ppm markets commercialized 
ppm based ratings service revenue increased by million primarily due to the partial year impact of the ppm markets commercialized during and the full year impact of the ppm markets commercialized in  as well as price escalators in all ppm commercialized markets 
included in the above net increase in revenue related to our ppm service is a million decrease in pre currency revenue from million for ppm markets commercialized during to million for the smaller ppm markets commercialized during 
table of contents this increase in ppm revenue was substantially offset by a million decrease in revenue related to the transition from our diary based ratings service  as well as a million reduction in revenue associated with two customers  primarily attributable to cumulus but also including clear channel  for our diary based radio ratings service in a limited number of small and medium sized markets 
ppm international revenue decreased by million largely due to decreased equipment sales 
included in the above fluctuations in revenue related to our diary based ratings service and our ppm ratings service is a million aggregate decrease in revenue from customers  including univision  that were subscribers in but either did not subscribe or reduced their level of subscribed services in cost of revenue 
cost of revenue increased by or million for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in cost of revenue increased primarily due to million of increased ppm service related costs incurred to build and manage ppm panels for the ppm markets commercialized as of december   as compared to the ppm markets commercialized as of december  in addition  we incurred million of increased costs associated with our cross platform services and million of increased recruitment costs related to cell phone household recruiting for both the diary and ppm services and targeted in person recruiting for our ppm service 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease for ppm international related to lower revenues 
selling  general  and administrative 
selling  general  and administrative decreased by or million for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in selling  general  and administrative decreased primarily due to a million decrease in selling and marketing expenses resulting from cost containment and reduction initiatives  a million net decrease in non cash share based compensation resulting primarily from ceo successions during and  and a million decrease in legal fees 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase of million in severance charges  and a million supplemental retirement plan settlement loss incurred during the first quarter of research and development 
research and development decreased by or million for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in research and development decreased primarily due to a million reduction in development costs related to our ppm service  a million reduction in development costs related to cross platform services  and a million decrease associated with the development of our client software 
restructuring and reorganization 
during  we reduced our workforce by approximately percent of our full time employees 
no restructuring expenses were incurred during  as compared to million of pre tax restructuring charges  related principally to severance  termination benefits  outplacement support  and certain other expenses in connection with our restructuring plan 
income tax expense 
the effective tax rate increased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december   primarily due to a state tax benefit recognized as a result from a favorable state tax ruling received during the fourth quarter of ebit and ebitda 
ebit increased by or million for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in  primarily due to higher revenue in while total costs and expenses were relatively unchanged 
ebitda increased by or million because this non gaap financial measure excludes depreciation and amortization  which for increased by million as compared to liquidity and capital resources comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  as of december  as of december  change cash and cash equivalents working capital surplus deficiency working capital  excluding deferred revenue and current portion of credit facility total debt we have relied upon our cash flow from operations  supplemented by borrowings under our available revolving credit facility credit facility as needed  to fund our dividends  capital expenditures  and contractual obligations

table of contents and anticipated levels of operating performance  our cash flow from operations  cash and cash equivalents  and availability under our credit facility will be sufficient to support our operations for the next to months 
see credit facility for further discussion of the relevant terms and covenants 
operating activities 
for the year ended december   the net cash provided by operating activities was million  which was primarily due to million in ebitda  increased by million of non cash share based compensation and a million non cash impairment of investment charge 
these increases were partially offset by million in income taxes paid 
ebitda is discussed and reconciled to net income in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december   was positively impacted by a million decrease in prepaid income taxes 
in addition  net cash provided by operating activities included a million increase in payroll  bonus  and benefit accruals 
these net increases in operating activities for the year ended december   were partially offset by a million decrease in operating activities associated with our accounts receivable  which grew primarily due to price escalators associated with our ppm ratings service 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities for the years ended december   and  was million and million  respectively 
this million increase in cash used in investing activities was due primarily to a million net increase in business acquisitions  which included a million cash outlay for the purchase of zokem oy during  and a million asset acquisition during in addition  capital expenditures increased by million for  as compared to  due primarily to a million increase in internally developed and purchased software  largely offset by a million decrease in metering equipment and other ppm related capital expenditures

net cash used in financing activities for the years ended december   and  was million and million  respectively 
the million increase in net cash used in financing activities was due primarily to a million increase in the net repayment of our outstanding obligations under our credit facility during  as compared to  and a million repayment related to zokem oy debt assumed in the related acquisition 
net cash used in financing activities also included an increase related to a million reduction in stock option exercises for  as compared to  when a substantial number of stock options were nearing their expiration 
these increases to net cash used in financing activities were partially offset by a million reversal of a bank overdraft payable during the first quarter of repatriation of foreign earnings we have provided us taxes on all of our foreign earnings  consistent with the us internal revenue code s taxation of world wide income

table of contents operating activities 
for the year ended december   the net cash provided by operating activities was million  which was primarily due to million in ebitda  increased by million of non cash share based compensation 
these increases were partially offset by million in income taxes paid 
ebitda is discussed and reconciled to net income in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations 
net cash provided by operating activities was negatively impacted by million due to increased accounts receivable balances  which resulted substantially from increased billings related to the completion of our plan to commercialize our ppm ratings service in the ppm markets 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities for the years ended december   and  was million and million  respectively

financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities for the years ended december   and  was million and million  respectively 
this million decrease in net cash used in financing activities was due primarily to a million increase in proceeds from stock option exercises and stock purchase plans  which resulted from an increase in our company stock price during  as well as a million decrease in the net repayment of our outstanding obligations under our credit facility during as compared to these decreases to net cash used in financing activities were substantially offset by a million change related to the recording of a bank overdraft payable in credit facility on november   we terminated our credit facility agreement originally signed on december  the credit facility 
also  on november   we entered into the credit facility  a new agreement with a consortium of lenders to provide up to million of financing through a five year  unsecured revolving credit facility expiring on november  the agreement contains an expansion feature to increase the total financing available under the credit facility by up to million to an aggregate of million 
such increased financing would be provided by one or more existing credit facility lending institutions  subject to the approval of the lending banks  and or in combination with one or more new lending institutions  subject to the approval of the credit facility s administrative agent 
interest on borrowings under the credit facility is calculated based on a floating rate for a duration of up to six months  at which time the interest rate is reset based upon the libor or  with the consent of each lender  nine or months 
our credit facility contains financial terms  covenants and operating restrictions that potentially restrict our financial flexibility 
the material debt covenants under our credit facility include both a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio 
the leverage ratio is a non gaap financial measure equal to the amount of our consolidated total indebtedness  as defined in our credit facility  divided by a contractually defined adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and non cash compensation consolidated ebitda for the trailing four quarter period 
the interest coverage ratio is a non gaap financial measure equal to consolidated ebitda divided by total interest expense 
both ratios are designed as measures of our ability to meet current and future debt obligations 
the following table presents the actual ratios and their threshold limits as defined by the credit facility as of december  covenant threshold actual maximum leverage ratio minimum interest coverage ratio as of december   based upon these financial covenants  there was no default or limit on our ability to borrow the unused portion of our credit facility 
our credit facility contains customary events of default  including nonpayment and breach covenants 
in the event of default  repayment of borrowings under the credit facility could be accelerated 
our credit facility also contains cross default provisions 
table of contents whereby a default on any material indebtedness  as defined in the credit facility  could result in the acceleration of our outstanding debt and the termination of any unused commitment under the credit facility 
the agreement potentially limits  among other things  our ability to sell assets  incur additional indebtedness  and grant or incur liens on our assets 
under the terms of the credit facility  all of our material domestic subsidiaries  if any  must guarantee the commitment 
currently  we do not have any material domestic subsidiaries as defined under the terms of the credit facility 
although we do not believe the terms of our credit facility limit the operation of our business in any material respect  the terms of the credit facility may restrict or prohibit our ability to raise additional debt when needed or could prevent us from investing in other growth initiatives 
as of december   we had outstanding letters of credit of million 
there were no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility as of december  as of december   our outstanding borrowings under the credit facility were million

off balance sheet arrangements we did not enter into any off balance sheet arrangements during the years ended december   or  nor did we have any off balance sheet arrangements outstanding as of december   or new accounting pronouncements testing goodwill for impairment 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment asu  to allow entities to use a qualitative approach to test goodwill for impairment 
asu permits an entity to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
if it is concluded this is the case  it is necessary to perform the currently prescribed two step goodwill impairment test 
otherwise  the two step goodwill impairment test is not required 
asu is effective for the company for interim and annual periods ended during  with earlier application permitted 
the company does not expect its pending adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements 
in may  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and international financial reporting standards topic fair value measurement asu  to provide a consistent definition of fair value and ensure that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and international financial reporting standards 
asu changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements particularly for level fair value measurements 
asu is effective for the company for interim and annual periods ended during and will be applied prospectively 
the company does not expect its pending adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our interest income and expense are sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of interest rates 
as such  changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash and cash equivalents and other highly liquid investments  as well as the value of those investments 
in november  we entered into our credit facility with a consortium of lenders to provide us up to million of financing 
interest on borrowings under the credit facility is calculated based on a floating rate for a duration of up to six months  at which time the interest rate is reset based upon the libor 
as of december   we reported no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility 
therefore  a hypothetical market interest rate change of would have zero impact on our results of operations over a month period 
a hypothetical market interest rate change of would have no impact on either the carrying amount or the fair value of the credit facility 
we do not use derivatives for speculative or trading purposes 
foreign currency risk we are exposed to the translation of foreign currency earnings to the us dollar 
our principal exposures are to the euro via our finland subsidiary and the indian rupee via our india subsidiary 
if we expand our foreign operations in both india and finland  our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate trends could increase  resulting in higher or lower translation impacts to our financial results and position 
as of december   we have million in recorded intercompany balances on our finnish and indian subsidiary balance sheets  which are impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
as the exchange rates increase or decrease  our intercompany balances will be exposed to translation adjustment charges and or credits  which will be recognized in our financial earning results 
the translation of the statements of income and balance sheets of our international subsidiaries is made using the foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each reporting period and the translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss on our consolidated balance sheet until the net investment in such foreign subsidiaries is liquidated 
as of december   the cumulative net currency translation adjustment recorded on our balance sheet reduced our shareholders equity by million
