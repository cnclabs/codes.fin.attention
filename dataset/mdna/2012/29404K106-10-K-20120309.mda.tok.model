table of contents revenues overview we earn revenues primarily under two pricing models 
first  a majority of our revenues is derived from fees charged as a percentage of the assets that are managed or administered on our technology platform by financial advisors 
these revenues are recorded under revenues from assets under management or administration 
our asset based fees vary based on the types of investment solutions and services that financial advisors utilize 
asset based fees accounted for approximately  and of our total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in future periods  the percentage of our total revenues attributable to asset based fees is expected to vary based on fluctuations in securities markets  whether we enter into significant license agreements  the mix of assets under management  or aum  and assets under administration  or aua  and other factors 
as of december   approximately billion of investment assets subject to asset based fees were managed or administered utilizing our technology platform by approximately  financial advisors through approximately  investor accounts 
second  we generate revenues from recurring  contractual licensing fees for providing access to our technology platform  generally from a small number of enterprise clients 
these revenues are recorded under revenues from licensing and professional services 
licensing fees are generally fixed in nature for the contract term and are based on the level of investment solutions and services provided  rather than on the amount of client assets on our technology platform 
licensing fees accounted for  and of our total revenues for the years ended december   and fees received in connection with professional services accounted for the remainder of our total revenues 
as of december   approximately billion of investment assets for which we receive licensing fees for utilizing our technology platform were serviced by approximately  financial advisors through approximately  investor accounts 
the following table provides information regarding the amount of assets utilizing our platform  financial advisors and investor accounts in the periods indicated 
as of december  in millions except accounts and advisors data platform assets assets under management aum assets under administration aua subtotal aum a licensing total platform assets platform accounts aum aua subtotal aum a licensing total platform accounts advisors aum a licensing total advisors 
table of contents revenues from assets under management or administration we generally charge our customers fees based on a higher percentage of the market value of aum than the fees we charge on the market value of aua  because we provide fiduciary oversight and or act as the investment advisor in connection with assets we categorize as aum 
the level of fees varies based on the nature of the investment solutions and services we provide  as well as the specific investment manager  fund and or custodian chosen by the financial advisor 
a portion of our revenues from assets under management or administration include costs paid by us to third parties for sub advisory  clearing  custody and brokerage services 
these expenses are recorded under cost of revenues 
we do not have fiduciary responsibility in connection with aua and  therefore  charge lower fees on these assets 
our fees for aua vary based on the nature of the investment solutions and services we provide 
for over of our revenues from assets under management or administration  we bill customers at the beginning of each quarter based on the market value of customer assets on our technology platform as of the end of the prior quarter 
for example  revenues from assets under management or administration recognized during the fourth quarter of were primarily based on the market value of assets as of september  our revenues from assets under management or administration are generally recognized ratably throughout the quarter based on the number of days in the quarter 
our revenues from assets under management or administration are affected by the amount of new assets that are added to existing and new client accounts  which we refer to as gross sales  and the amount of assets that are withdrawn from client accounts  which we refer to as redemptions 
we refer to the difference between asset in flows and outflows as net flows 
positive net flows indicate that the market value of assets added to client accounts exceeds the market value of assets that have been withdrawn from client accounts 
our revenues from assets under management or administration are also affected by changes in the market values of securities held in client accounts due to fluctuations in the securities markets 
certain types of securities have historically experienced greater market price fluctuations  such as equity securities  than other securities  such as fixed income securities  though in any given period the nature of securities that experience the greatest fluctuations may vary 
for example  from october to march  the equity markets  as measured by the value of the s p index  declined in value by approximately  which significantly contributed to the decrease in our revenues from assets under management or administration between the fourth quarter of and the second quarter of the following table provides information regarding the degree to which gross sales  redemptions  net flows and changes in the market values of assets contributed to changes in aum or aua in the periods indicated 
asset rollforward as of gross sales redemp tions net flows market impact fundquest as of in millions except account data assets under management aum assets under administration aua subtotal aum a fee based accounts 
table of contents on december   we closed on our acquisition of fundquest 
at that time  billion of fundquest assets previously reported as aua were reclassified to aum 
also during the fourth quarter  one of fundquest s clients with billion in assets transitioned to licensing for a flat fee and is no longer reflected in aua as of december  asset rollforward as of gross sales redemp tions net flows market impact as of in millions except account data assets under management aum assets under administration aua subtotal aum a fee based accounts the mix of assets under management and assets under administration was as follows for the periods indicated december  assets under management aum assets under administration aua we expect the percentage of aum and aua will fluctuate in future periods 
the nature and type of services requested by our customers are the key drivers in determining whether customer assets are classified as aum or aua 
therefore  we do not have direct control over the mix of aum and aua 
revenues from licensing and professional services fees our revenues received under license agreements are recognized over the contractual term 
to a lesser degree we also receive revenues from professional services fees by providing customers with certain technology platform software development services 
in the years ended december   and  our revenues from professional services fees were million  million and million respectively 
these revenues are generally recognized under a proportional performance model utilizing an output based approach 
our contracts have fixed prices  and generally specify or quantify interim deliverables 
we may enter into license agreements in future periods if requested by our customers and commercially attractive to us 
expenses the following is a description of our principal expense items 
cost of revenues cost of revenues primarily include expenses related to our receipt of sub advisory and clearing  custody and brokerage services from third parties 
the largest component of cost of revenues  sub advisory fees paid to third party investment managers  relates only to aum since a sub advisor is not utilized in connection with aua 

table of contents clearing  custody and brokerage services are provided by third party providers 
these expenses are typically calculated based upon a contractual percentage of the market value of assets held in customer accounts measured as of the end of each fiscal quarter and are recognized ratably throughout the quarter based on the number of days in the quarter 
compensation and benefits compensation and benefits expenses primarily relate to employee compensation  including salaries  commissions  non cash stock based compensation  incentive compensation  benefits and employer related taxes 
general and administration general and administration expenses include occupancy costs and expenses relating to communications services  research and data services  website and system development  marketing  professional and legal services and travel and entertainment 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expenses include depreciation and amortization related to fixed assets  including computer equipment and software  leasehold improvements  office furniture and fixtures and other office equipment  internally developed software  and intangible assets  primarily related to customer lists  the value of which was capitalized in connection with our prior acquisitions 
furniture and equipment is depreciated using the straight line method based on the estimated useful lives of the depreciable assets 
leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated economic useful lives or the remaining lease term  whichever is shorter 
improvements are capitalized  while repairs and maintenance costs are recorded as expenses in the period they are incurred 
assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
internally developed software is amortized on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life 
we evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets 
intangible assets are depreciated using an accelerated basis over their estimated economic useful lives and are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets 
developments fundquest agreement on december  we acquired all of the outstanding shares of fundquest for total consideration of million 
fundquest  operating as envestnet portfolio solutions  inc  provides managed account programs  overlay portfolio management  mutual funds  institutional asset management and investment consulting to registered investment advisors  independent advisors  broker dealers  banks and trust organizations 
upon closing of the transaction  the existing platform services agreement between us and fundquest was terminated see notes and to the notes to the audited financial statements and approximately billion of the fundquest s assets were reclassified to assets under management from assets under administration 
in addition  one of fundquest s clients with billion in assets transitioned to licensing from assets under administration 

table of contents fidelity agreement for the years ended december   and  revenues associated with our relationship with our single largest client  fidelity  accounted for  and  respectively  of our total revenues 
as of december   we renegotiated a five year license agreement with fidelity which resulted in a reduction in our current license fee revenue 
in addition  as a part of the renegotiated agreement  we will continue to receive ongoing platform services fees through the fidelity relationship based upon asset based fees 
management anticipates that projected increases in asset based fees will offset the aforementioned reduction in license fees by the end of fiscal however  no assurance can be given that the projected increases in asset based fees will offset the reduction in license fees 
developments prima capital holding  inc agreement on february  we entered into a stock purchase agreement with the shareholders of prima to acquire all of the outstanding shares of prima for cash consideration of approximately million  subject to certain post closing adjustments 
prima provides investment management due diligence  research applications  asset allocation modeling and multi manager porfolios to the wealth management and retirement industries 
prima s clientele includes seven of the top banks in the us as measured by total assets  independent rias  regional broker dealers  family offices and trust companies 
we anticipate closing this transaction in the first half of tamarac  inc agreement on february  we entered into a merger agreement with tamarac 
a newly formed subsidiary of envestnet will merge with and into tamarac  and tamarac will become a wholly owned subsidiary of envestnet 
under the terms of the agreement  total cash consideration will be approximately million in cash for all of the outstanding stock of tamarac  subject to certain post closing adjustments 
we have also agreed to establish a management incentive plan funded by million of shares of common stock for the benefit of certain employees of tamarac 
such shares will be distributed at pre established intervals  but in no event later than may   based upon tamarac meeting certain financial targets and will be subject to additional vesting requirements 
tamarac is a provider of sophisticated portfolio management technology that enables ria s to efficiently deliver customized individual account management to their clients 
we anticipate closing this transaction in the first half of critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or us gaap 
the accounting policies described below require management to apply significant judgment in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
in particular  judgment is applied to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in calculating estimates that affect certain reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
if different estimates or assumptions were used  our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows could have been materially different than those reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
for additional information regarding our critical accounting policies  see note to the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues when all four of the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered or the service has been performed  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 

table of contents types of revenues we generate revenues from assets under management or administration and from licensing and professional service fees 
revenues from assets under management or administration are generated from fees based on a contractual percentage of assets under management or administration valued at each quarter end 
these fees are generally collected at the beginning of a quarter in advance based upon the previous quarter end values 
in less than of our contracts  fees are collected at the end of the quarter based upon the average daily balance 
the contractual fee percentages vary based upon the level and type of services we provide to our customers 
pursuant to the contracts with our customers  we calculate our fees based on the asset values in the customer s account  without making any judgment or estimates 
none of our fees are earned pursuant to performance based or other incentive based arrangements 
we generate revenues from licensing fees pursuant to recurring contractual fixed fee agreements  principally with a portion of our enterprise clients 
our licensing fees vary based on the type of services we provide 
we generate revenues from professional service fees by providing customers with customized technology platform software development services 
these revenues are received pursuant to contracts that detail the nature of the services to be provided by us  the estimated number of hours such work will require and the total contract fee amount 
recognition of revenues application of the applicable accounting principles of us gaap requires us to make judgments and estimates in connection with the measurement and recognition of revenues 
revenues are recognized in the period in which the related services are provided 
in certain cases  management is required to determine whether revenues should be recognized in an amount equal to the gross fees we receive or as a net amount reflecting the payment of expenses to third parties  such as sub advisors and custodians  that provide services to us in connection with certain of our financial advisors client accounts 
when fees are collected for sub advisory  clearing  custody or brokerage services in circumstances where we do not have a direct contract with the third party provider  the fees are recorded as revenue on a net basis 
fees we received in advance of the performance of services are recorded as deferred revenues on our consolidated balance sheets and are recognized as revenues when earned  generally over three months 
revenues from licensing are recognized over the contractual term 
contracts with nonstandard terms and conditions may require contract interpretation to determine the appropriate revenue recognition policy to apply 
revenues from professional services are recognized under a proportional performance model utilizing an output based approach 
our contracts have fixed prices  and generally specify or quantify interim deliverables 
our revenue recognition is also affected by our judgment in determining appropriate allowances for uncollectible receivables 
we consider customer specific information related to delinquent accounts and past lost experience  as well as current economic conditions in establishing the amount of the allowance 
customer inducements in certain instances  we have entered into agreements which include inducement payments to the customer 
in accordance with us gaap  inducement payments made to customers are capitalized and amortized against revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement 
customer inducement assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances occur that may impact the fair value of these assets 
internally developed software costs relating to internally developed software that are incurred in the preliminary stages of development are expensed as incurred 
management determines when projects have met the criteria of the application development stage 
this typically occurs when the conceptual formulation and evaluation of software functionality are finalized 

table of contents once work on a software application has passed the preliminary stages  internal and external costs  if direct and incremental  are capitalized until the software application is substantially complete and ready for its intended use 
these costs include expenditures related to software design  technical specifications  coding  installation of hardware and parallel testing 
we cease capitalizing these costs upon completion of all substantial testing of the software application 
we also capitalize costs related to specific upgrades and enhancements of our internally developed software when we conclude that it is probable that the expenditures will result in additional functionality 
our maintenance and training costs are expensed as incurred 
as of december  and  we had net capitalized internally developed software of million and million  respectively 
we capitalized million  million and million in internally developed software during the years ended december   and  respectively 
internally developed software is amortized on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life 
we evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets 
there were no impairments to internally developed software during the years ended december   and non cash stock based compensation expense since our stock incentive plan and long term incentive plan were adopted  stock options have been an important component of our compensation structure 
we expect that this will continue to be the case in the future 
our board of directors is responsible for determining the timing and magnitude of all stock options and restricted stock grants 
prior to our initial public offering on july   our board of directors  was responsible for determining the fair value of our common stock on the date of each stock option grant 
the board of directors had delegated certain of its responsibilities to the compensation committee of the board of directors and certain members of management 
as required under our stock incentive plan and our long term incentive plan  all of our stock options are granted with exercise prices at or above the fair value of our common stock on the grant date 
the following table provides information regarding stock options and restricted stock granted for january  through december  date shares stock price exercise price intrinsic value as of december  options restricted stock  n a n a  n a n a 
table of contents prior to our initial public offering in july  there was no market for our common stock and therefore no readily available price to reference when determining the fair value of our common stock in connection with the granting of stock options 
the value of our common stock was dependent upon our company valuation and  as described below  we had periodically obtained independent valuations and performed internal valuations of our common stock 
in each case  such valuations had been performed contemporaneously and we had determined the fair market value of our company in conformity with commonly accepted corporate valuation techniques and methodologies 
prior to our initial public offering  we generally had obtained contemporaneous independent valuations at least annually and at the time of broad based option grants  such as on may  for our internal valuations  we applied the same approach and methodology used by the independent valuation firm 
for any option grants made between quarterly valuations of our common stock  our board of directors assessed all available information in determining whether the stock price in effect at the time of the grant should otherwise be adjusted 
as a private company  we had performed our quarterly valuations such that they were effective approximately days following the end of each calendar quarter to approximate the date upon which  if we were a reporting company  we would be required to disclose to the public through filings with the commission our financial performance and associated operating metrics  which include assets under management and administration 
until such date  any information about a given quarter s financial performance  ending asset values  and other information that could be deemed material to investors  would not be known to the public even if we were a reporting company and therefore is not included in the valuation of our common stock during interim periods 
in the specific cases of option grants made after the dates of our quarterly valuations during the period under review  our board of directors concluded that no adjustment should have been made to the most recent valuation of our common stock based on its assessment that  had we been a reporting company  no new material information would have been available to the public since the date of the prior valuation of our common stock 
prior to our initial public offering  our company valuation  whether prepared by an independent valuation firm or performed internally  considered an income approach  also known as a discounted cash flow analysis  incorporating our historical and expected financial performance  the relevant market and industry and economic trends 
our valuation also considered a market approach  including recent capital transactions involving either our company or comparable companies  and comparable public company valuations 
the resulting calculation assigned a value for of our company s equity on a marketable equivalent  non controlling interest basis 
we considered  but did not include  an asset approach  as we did not believe the book value of our assets provides meaningful input into our expected revenue and earnings  or the value of our company 
we believe the value of our common stock had the potential to change each fiscal quarter in the normal course of our business  since the majority of our total revenues earned in a given quarter are calculated based on the value of aum and aua as of the end of the previous fiscal quarter 
these revenues  and our historical resulting projections for earnings and cash flow  were inherently subject to fluctuations from quarter to quarter 
accordingly  prior to our initial public offering  we calculated the value of our common stock at least once each fiscal quarter 
the historical quarterly valuations did at times fluctuate significantly as the market value of our assets under management or administration drives our near term financial results and longer term projections 
the value of our common stock could also change if a material financing transaction or other significant event occured within a given fiscal quarter 
in such circumstances we performed an additional valuation of our common stock at the time of the transaction or event  using the same valuation methodology that was utilized in connection with our quarterly valuations 
after we determined a value for our company  we allocated the value to each class of our shares  including our common stock 
our value allocation methodology applies the principles set forth in the aicpa practice aid valuation of privately held company equity securities issued as compensation  or the practice aid 
the practice aid defines appropriate methods to allocate enterprise value to common shares when multiple share 
table of contents classes exist 
based on various factors  including the stage of a company s life and the timing and likelihood of various liquidity events  one method of allocation may be more appropriate than the others 
we considered  but did not use  the probability weighted expected return method due to the number of assumptions for each scenario that are difficult to estimate  and the fact that our most likely liquidation event was an initial public offering 
additionally  we did not apply the liquidation method because  as the practice aid indicates  it would be inappropriate for a later stage company such as ours to use that method to allocate value to the various share classes 
furthermore  the more imminent a liquidity event becomes  the more aligned the liquidation model and option pricing model become in attributing value to each share class 
accordingly  we used the option pricing method  as defined in the practice aid  which treats each class of equity as having a call option on the enterprise value 
the option pricing method considers the economic preferences and other rights attributable to each share class  resulting in a price for each of our share classes  including our common stock 
our valuations of our common stock also reflected a discount for lack of marketability  adjusted over time to reflect the expected likelihood and timing of a liquidity event subsequent to each valuation date 
no other discounts were applied in determining the value of our common stock 
during and through the date our initial public offering on july   we performed the following contemporaneous valuations of our common stock date fair value of common stock as described above  the assets under management or administration on our technology platform at the end of a given quarter have a significant impact on our short and long term financial projections and resulting valuation 
for example  the valuation conducted on may  incorporated financial projections based on assets under management or administration as of march  the value of those assets was below the value of the assets as of december  this contributed to the decline in the estimated fair value of our common stock between periods 
conversely  assets under management or administration increased between march  and june   contributing to an increase in the estimated fair value of our common stock between may  and august  in addition  assets under management or administration increased between june  and september   which contributed to the increase in the fair value of our common stock between august  and november  a increase in assets under management or administration between september  and december   as well as the platform services agreement signed with fundquest in february of  contributed to the increase in the fair value of our common stock between november  and february  the decrease between the fair value of our common stock on november  and february  and the initial public offering price was principally attributable to volatility in the trading prices of the common stock of comparable companies and the difficult conditions in the market for initial public offerings at and immediately prior to our determination of the initial public offering price 
other factors  such as updated financial projections not related to changes in our assets under management or administration  as well as fluctuations in the value of comparable publicly traded companies  also contributed to the differences in the estimated fair value of our common stock between periods 
since our initial public offering on july   we have not performed internal valuations or obtained independent valuations in order to determine the company s stock price to reference when determining the fair value of our common stock in connection with the granting of stock options or restricted stock 
non cash stock based compensation expense for stock option and restricted stock grants is estimated at the grant date based on each grant s fair value  calculated using the black scholes option pricing model 
compensation and benefits expenses are recognized over the vesting period for each grant 
the fair value of our 
table of contents stock options and the resulting expenses are based on various assumptions  including the expected volatility of our stock price  the expected term of the stock options  estimated forfeiture rates and the risk free interest rate 
the use of different assumptions would result in different fair values and compensation and benefits expenses for our option grants 
business combinations we account for business combinations under the purchase accounting method 
the cost of an acquired company is assigned to the tangible and intangible assets purchased and the liabilities assumed on the basis of their fair values at the date of acquisition 
the determination of fair values of assets and liabilities acquired requires us to make estimates and use valuation techniques when market value is not readily available 
any excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired is allocated to goodwill 
the transaction costs associated with business combinations are expensed as they are incurred 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states and india 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method to account for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and for net operating loss carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized under income tax provision in the period that includes the enactment date 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that we determine is more likely than not to be realized in the future 
in our ordinary course of business  we may enter into transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
in such cases  we establish reserves for tax related uncertainties based on our estimates of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
the reserves are established when we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and may not be fully sustained on review by tax authorities 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or refinement of an estimate 
although we believe our reserves are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will be reflected in our provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate 
significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all available evidence  including past operating results  estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies 
in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized  we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rates primarily due to adjustments in valuation allowances  state income taxes and changes in rates 
our provision for income taxes varies based on  among other things  changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  the tax effects of non cash stock based compensation or changes in applicable tax laws  regulations and accounting principles or interpretations thereof 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of million and million  respectively  available to reduce future income subject to income taxes 
the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards expire through 
table of contents we are subject to examination of our income tax returns by the us internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows

we do not expect to incur restructuring charges relating to the closure of our los angeles office in in  we incurred restructuring charges of approximately million primarily for severance charges related to the termination of certain fundquest and envestnet employees related to the fundquest acquisition 
we do not expect that our restructuring charges related to the fundquest acquisition will be significant in interest expense interest expense increased from million in to million in  primarily due to imputed interest on the payments due to fundquest

the compensation committee of our board of directors and our management use adjusted ebitda  adjusted operating income  adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share as measures of operating performance  for planning purposes  including the preparation of annual budgets  to allocate resources to enhance the financial performance of our business  to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies  and in communications with our board of directors concerning our financial performance 
our compensation committee and our management may also consider adjusted ebitda  among other factors  when determining management s incentive compensation 
we also present adjusted ebitda  adjusted operating income  adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share as supplemental performance measures because we believe that they provide our board of directors  management and investors with additional information to assess our performance 
we believe adjusted ebitda  adjusted operating income  adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share are useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance because securities analysts use adjusted ebitda  adjusted operating income  adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share as supplemental measures to evaluate the overall performance of companies  and we anticipate that our investor and analyst presentations will include adjusted ebitda  adjusted operating income  adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share

recent accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued authoritative guidance that enables vendors to account for products or services sold to customers deliverables separately rather than as a combined unit  as was generally required by past guidance 
the revised guidance provides for two significant changes to the existing multiple element revenue arrangement guidance 
the first change relates to the determination of when individual deliverables included in a multiple element arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting 
the second change modifies the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified deliverables 
this guidance also significantly expands the disclosures required for multiple element revenue arrangements 
the guidance is required to be adopted in fiscal years beginning on or after june   but early adoption is permitted 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued authoritative guidance that changes the accounting model for revenue arrangements that include both tangible products and software elements so that tangible products containing 
table of contents software components and nonsoftware components that function together to deliver the tangible product s essential functionality are no longer within the scope of the software revenue guidance in accounting standards codification asc subtopic in addition  this guidance requires hardware components of a tangible product containing software components always be excluded from the software revenue guidance 
the guidance is required to be adopted in fiscal years beginning on or after june   but early adoption is permitted 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance that amends asc topic  comprehensive income  to require that all non owner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements  and it eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as a part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
in addition  this guidance requires an entity to present on the face of the financial statements reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statement s where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented 
these amendments are to be applied retrospectively and are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december   however  early adoption is permitted 
we do not anticipate the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued authoritative guidance regarding the testing of goodwill for impairment 
this guidance allows companies to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether or not the current two step quantitative testing method  in which a company compares the fair value of reporting units to its carrying amount including goodwill  must be followed 
if a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount  then the quantitative impairment test is not required 
a company may choose to use the qualitative assessment on none  some  or all of its reporting units or to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the two step quantitative testing method 
this guidance is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december   however  early adoption is permitted 
we do not anticipate that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk our exposure to market risk is directly related to revenues from asset management or administration services earned based upon a contractual percentage of aum or aua 
in the years ended december   and   and of our revenues  respectively  were derived from revenues based on the market value of aum or aua 
we expect this percentage to vary over time 
a decrease in the aggregate value of aum or aua may cause our revenue and income to decline 
foreign currency risk the expenses of our india subsidiary  which primarily consist of expenditures related to compensation and benefits  are paid using the indian rupee 
we are directly exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates through the translation of these monthly expenditures into us dollars 
as of december   we estimate that a hypothetical increase in the value of the indian rupee to the us dollar would result in a decrease of million to pre tax earnings and a hypothetical decrease in the value of the indian rupee to the us dollar would result in a million increase to pre tax earnings 
interest rate risk we have no floating interest rate debt and therefore we are not directly exposed to interest rate risk
