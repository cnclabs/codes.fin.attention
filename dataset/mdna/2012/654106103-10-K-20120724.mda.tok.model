item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional information 

table of contents sales and marketing financial information about geographic and segment operations appears in note operating segments and related information of the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements on page we experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year 
historically  revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third quarters 
however  the mix of product sales may vary considerably as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear  apparel and equipment 
because nike is a consumer products company  the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products 
we must therefore respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings  developing new products  styles and categories  and influencing sports and fitness preferences through aggressive marketing 
failure to respond in a timely and adequate manner could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability 
this is a continuing risk 
we report our nike brand operations based on our internal geographic organization 
each nike brand geography operates predominantly in one industry the design  development  marketing and selling of athletic footwear  apparel  and equipment 
our reportable operating segments for the nike brand are north america  western europe  central eastern europe  greater china  japan  and emerging markets 
our nike brand direct to consumer operations are managed within each geographic segment 
united states market in fiscal  sales in the united states including us sales of our other businesses accounted for approximately of total revenues  compared to in fiscal and in fiscal our other businesses were primarily comprised of our affiliate brands  cole haan  converse  hurley and umbro  and nike golf 
we sell to thousands of retail accounts in the united states  including a mix of footwear stores  sporting goods stores  athletic specialty stores  department stores  skate  tennis and golf shops  and other retail accounts 
during fiscal  our three largest customers accounted for approximately of sales in the united states 
we make substantial use of our futures ordering program  which allows retailers to order five to six months in advance of delivery with the commitment that their orders will be delivered within a set time period at a fixed price 
in fiscal  of our us wholesale footwear shipments excluding our other businesses were made under the futures program  compared to in fiscal and in fiscal in fiscal  of our us wholesale apparel shipments excluding our other businesses were made under the futures program  compared to in fiscal and in fiscal we utilize nike sales offices to solicit sales in the united states as well as independent sales representatives to sell specialty products for golf  skateboarding and snowboarding products 
in addition  our direct to consumer operations sell nike brand products through our internet website  www 
nikestore 
com  and the following in line and factory retail outlets in the united states us retail stores number nike factory stores nike in line stores  including niketowns and employee only stores cole haan stores including factory stores converse stores including factory stores hurley stores including factory and employee stores total nike s three significant distribution centers in the united states for nike brand products  including nike golf  are located in memphis  tennessee 
nike also operates and leases one facility in memphis  tennessee for nike brand product returns 
nike brand apparel and equipment products are also shipped from our foothill ranch  california distribution center 
cole haan products are distributed primarily from greenland  new hampshire  and converse and hurley products are shipped primarily from ontario  california 
international markets in fiscal  non us sales including non us sales of our other businesses accounted for of total revenues  compared to in fiscal and in fiscal we sell our products to retail accounts  through our own direct to consumer operations  and through a mix of independent distributors  licensees and sales representatives around the world 
we sell to thousands of retail accounts and operate distribution centers outside of the united states 
in many countries and regions  including canada  asia  some latin american countries  and europe  we have a futures ordering program for retailers similar to the united states futures program described above 
during fiscal  nike s three largest customers outside of the us accounted for approximately of total non us sales 
our direct to consumer business operates the following in line and factory retail outlets outside the united states non us retail stores number nike factory stores nike in line stores  including niketowns and employee only stores cole haan stores including factory stores total 
table of contents international branch offices and subsidiaries of nike are located in argentina  australia  austria  belgium  bermuda  brazil  canada  chile  china  croatia  cyprus  the czech republic  denmark  finland  france  germany  greece  hong kong  hungary  indonesia  india  ireland  israel  italy  japan  korea  lebanon  macau  malaysia  mexico  new zealand  the netherlands  norway  the philippines  poland  portugal  russia  singapore  slovakia  slovenia  south africa  spain  sri lanka  sweden  switzerland  taiwan  thailand  turkey  the united arab emirates  the united kingdom  uruguay and vietnam 
significant customer no customer accounted for or more of our net sales during fiscal orders worldwide futures orders for nike brand athletic footwear and apparel  scheduled for delivery from june through november  were billion compared to billion for the same period last year 
this futures order amount is calculated based upon our forecast of the actual exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period 
reported futures orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenues for this period 
this is because the mix of orders can shift between futures and at once orders and the fulfillment of certain of these futures orders may fall outside of the scheduled time period noted above 
in addition  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues 
moreover  a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders  including at once and close out sales of nike brand footwear and apparel  sales of nike brand equipment  sales from our direct to consumer operations  and sales from our other businesses 
product research and development we believe our research and development efforts are a key factor in our past and future success 
technical innovation in the design and manufacturing process of footwear  apparel  and athletic equipment receive continued emphasis as nike strives to produce products that help to reduce injury  enhance athletic performance and maximize comfort 
in addition to nike s own staff of specialists in the areas of biomechanics  chemistry  exercise physiology  engineering  industrial design  and related fields  we also utilize research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes  coaches  trainers  equipment managers  orthopedists  podiatrists  and other experts who consult with us and review designs  materials  concepts for product and manufacturing process improvements and compliance with product safety regulations around the world 
employee athletes  athletes engaged under sports marketing contracts and other athletes wear test and evaluate products during the design and development process 
manufacturing virtually all of our footwear is produced by factories we contract with outside of the united states 
in fiscal  contract factories in vietnam  china and indonesia  manufactured approximately  and of total nike brand footwear  respectively 
we also have manufacturing agreements with independent factories in argentina  brazil  india  and mexico to manufacture footwear for sale primarily within those countries 
the largest single footwear factory that we have contracted with accounted for approximately of total fiscal nike brand footwear production 
almost all of nike brand apparel is manufactured outside of the united states by independent contract manufacturers located in countries 
most of this apparel production occurred in china  vietnam  thailand  sri lanka  malaysia  indonesia  turkey  cambodia  mexico  and el salvador 
the largest single apparel factory that we have contracted with accounted for approximately of total fiscal apparel production 
the principal materials used in our footwear products are natural and synthetic rubber  plastic compounds  foam cushioning materials  nylon  leather  canvas  and polyurethane films used to make air sole cushioning components 
during fiscal  nike ihm  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of nike  as well as independent contractors in china and taiwan  were our largest suppliers of the air sole cushioning components used in footwear 
the principal materials used in our apparel products are natural and synthetic fabrics and threads  plastic and metal hardware  and specialized performance fabrics designed to repel rain  retain heat  or efficiently transport body moisture 
nike s independent contractors and suppliers buy raw materials in bulk for the manufacturing of our footwear  apparel and equipment products 
most raw materials are available and purchased by those independent contractors and suppliers in the countries where manufacturing takes place 
we have thus far experienced little difficulty in satisfying our raw material requirements 
since  sojitz corporation of america sojitz america  a large japanese trading company and the sole owner of our redeemable preferred stock  has performed significant import export financing services for us 
during fiscal  sojitz america provided financing and purchasing services for nike brand products sold in argentina  uruguay  canada  brazil  india  indonesia  the philippines  malaysia  south africa  china  korea  and thailand  excluding products produced and sold in the same country 
approximately of nike brand sales occurred in those countries 
any failure of sojitz america to provide these services or any failure of sojitz america s banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers in those jurisdictions 
such a disruption could result in cancelled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability 
however  we believe that any such disruption would be short term in duration due to the ready availability of alternative sources of financing at competitive rates 
our current agreements with sojitz america expire on may  
table of contents international operations and trade our international operations and sources of supply are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad  such as possible revaluation of currencies  export and import duties  anti dumping measures  quotas  safeguard measures  trade restrictions  restrictions on the transfer of funds and  in certain parts of the world  political instability and terrorism 
we have not  to date  been materially affected by any such risk  but cannot predict the likelihood of such developments occurring 
the global economic recession resulted in a significant slow down in international trade and a sharp rise in protectionist actions around the world 
these trends are affecting many global manufacturing and service sectors  and the footwear and apparel industries  as a whole  are not immune 
companies in our industry are facing trade protectionist challenges in many different regions  and in nearly all cases we are working together to address trade issues to reduce the impact to the industry  while observing applicable competition laws 
notwithstanding our efforts  such actions  if implemented  could result in increases in the cost of our products  which may in turn adversely affect our sales or profitability and the imported footwear and apparel industry as a whole 
accordingly  we are actively monitoring the developments described below 
footwear imports into the european union in  at the request of the european domestic footwear industry  the european commission ec initiated investigations into leather footwear imported from china and vietnam 
together with other companies in our industry  we took the position that special technology athletic footwear staf i should not be within the scope of the investigation  and ii does not meet the legal requirements of injury and price in an anti dumping investigation 
our arguments were successful and the eu agreed in october on definitive duties of for china and for vietnam for non staf leather footwear  but excluded staf from the final measures 
prior to the scheduled expiration in october of the measures imposed on the non staf footwear  the domestic industry requested and the ec agreed to review a petition to extend these restrictions on non staf leather footwear 
in december  following a review of the ongoing restrictions  eu member states voted to extend the measures for an additional months  until march  in early  the ec declined to further extend the measures and since april  these restrictions have been terminated 
the ec noted at the time that it would monitor leather footwear imports from vietnam and china over the next months 
no new trade defense actions have been taken by the ec 
on february   the chinese government announced it would seek to refer the eu decision both on the original measures and subsequent review decision to the world trade organization wto for its further review and decision 
on may   the dispute settlement body of the wto agreed to establish a panel to rule on china s claims against the eu with respect to the above anti dumping measures 
on october   the wto issued a ruling in which it supported china s positions on a number of issues 
neither party has filed an appeal 
footwear  apparel and equipment imports into brazil and argentina at the request of certain domestic footwear industry participants  both brazil and argentina have initiated independent anti dumping investigations against footwear made in china 
over the last two years  we have been working with a broad coalition of other companies in our industry to challenge these cases on the basis that the athletic footwear being imported from china i should not be within the scope of the investigation  and ii does not meet the legal requirements of injury and price in an anti dumping investigation 
in the case of argentina  in  the final determination made by the administering authorities was favorable to us 
in the case of brazil  the administering authorities agreed to impose an anti dumping duty against nearly all footwear from china  which we believe will impact all brands in the footwear industry 
this decision does not materially affect us 
in october  the brazilian government initiated an anti circumvention investigation to determine whether chinese made products or components were subject to minimal assembly or finishing in vietnam or indonesia to evade anti dumping duties on chinese made products 
in july  the brazilian government found no circumvention was taking place and this matter is closed 
many products  including footwear  apparel and equipment  that we and others in our industry import into argentina and brazil are subject to the wto non automatic licensing requirements  which means that it may take up to days for those products to clear customs and enter into those jurisdictions 
from time to time  in addition to these wto licensing requirements  these jurisdictions impose further importation restrictions or limitations 
as a result  we have experienced delays in our ability to import our products or it has taken longer than the time allowed under the wto for us to import our products 
to date  our business has not been materially affected by these restrictions or delays 
in the future  however  if we are unable to import our products into these jurisdictions due to these or other restrictions or if we experience increasing or more frequent delays beyond the wto permitted days to import our products  our business could be materially affected 
footwear  apparel and equipment imports into turkey in  turkey introduced safeguard measures in the form of additional duties on all imported footwear into turkey with the goal of protecting its local shoe manufacturing industry until august in june  turkish shoe manufacturers submitted  and the turkish government agreed to review  a request for extension of the safeguard measures claiming that the rehabilitation process of the local turkish industry was interrupted due to the continuing increase of footwear imports 
despite the importers opposition to the continuation of the safeguard measures  the turkish authorities extended these safeguard measures until august  but reduced the duty from per pair of footwear to per pair of footwear 
in june  the government of turkey launched an expiry review on the footwear safeguards to assess if they should be extended for three additional years until august 
together with other companies in our industry  we are advocating for exclusion of certain footwear products staf shoes that cannot be manufactured in turkey and therefore should not be subject to a higher import duty 
in  two new safeguard measures and reviews were initiated by the turkish undersecretariat of foreign trade uft on apparel and equipment imports 
in january  the uft began an investigation on apparel imports that could result in a increase in import duties applied to imported apparel products  regardless of country of origin and with exceptions for eu 
table of contents and countries that are included in a cross cumulation of origin system in the framework of the free trade agreements to which turkey is a party  subject to evidence of preferential origin 
in july  these higher import duties were approved and will be in place through july together with other companies in our industry  we advocated for exclusion of certain apparel products used for sporting activities that cannot be manufactured in turkey and therefore should not be subject to a higher import duty but no exclusion has been granted 
in february  the uft began a review of existing safeguard measure on travel goods  handbags and similar accessories and containers listed under applicable regulations 
one turkish bag manufacturers association has requested the continuation of the safeguard measures through april  with the application of an additional import duty of kg max 
unit to kg max 
unit  regardless of country of origin 
in october  these higher import duties were approved and will be in place through april together with other companies in our industry  we advocated for the exclusion of non leather bags from the scope of the continued safeguards but no exclusion has been granted 
trade relations with china china represents an important sourcing country and consumer marketing country for us 
many governments around the world are concerned about china s growing and fast paced economy  compliance with wto rules  currency valuation  and high trade surpluses 
as a result  a wide range of legislative proposals have been introduced to address these concerns 
we are working with broad coalitions of global businesses and trade associations representing a wide variety of sectors eg  services  manufacturing  and agriculture to help ensure any legislation enacted and implemented i addresses legitimate and core concerns  ii is consistent with international trade rules  and iii reflects and considers china s domestic economy and the important role it has in the global economic community 
we believe other companies in our industry as well as most other multi national companies are in a similar position regarding these trade measures 
in the event any of these trade protection measures are implemented  we believe that we have the ability to develop  over a period of time  adequate alternative sources of supply for the products obtained from our present suppliers 
if events prevented us from acquiring products from our suppliers in a particular country  our operations could be temporarily disrupted and we could experience an adverse financial impact 
however  we believe we could abate any such disruption  and that much of the adverse impact on supply would  therefore  be of a short term nature 
we believe our principal competitors are subject to similar risks 
competition the athletic footwear  apparel  and equipment industry is keenly competitive in the united states and on a worldwide basis 
we compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure shoe companies  athletic and leisure apparel companies  sports equipment companies  and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure shoes  apparel  and equipment  including adidas  puma  and others 
the intense competition and the rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel  and athletic equipment  constitute significant risk factors in our operations 
nike is the largest seller of athletic footwear and athletic apparel in the world 
performance and reliability of shoes  apparel  and equipment  new product development  price  product identity through marketing and promotion  and customer support and service are important aspects of competition in the athletic footwear  apparel  and equipment industry 
to help market our products  we contract with prominent and influential athletes  coaches  teams  colleges and sports leagues to endorse our brands and use our products  and we actively sponsor sporting events and clinics 
we believe that we are competitive in all of these areas 
trademarks and patents we utilize trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods  in identifying our brands and the company  and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others 
we consider our nike and swoosh design trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in almost jurisdictions 
in addition  we own many other trademarks that we utilize in marketing our products 
we continue to vigorously protect our trademarks against infringement 
nike has an exclusive  worldwide license to make and sell footwear using patented air technology 
the process utilizes pressurized gas encapsulated in polyurethane 
some of the early nike air patents have expired  which may enable competitors to use certain types of similar technology 
subsequent nike air patents will not expire for several years 
we also have over a thousand us and foreign utility patents  and thousands of us and foreign design patents covering components  manufacturing techniques and features used in various athletic and leisure shoes  apparel  athletic equipment  digital devices and golf products 
these patents expire at various times  and patents issued for applications filed this year will last from now to for design patents  and from now to for utility patents 
we believe our success depends primarily upon skills in design  research and development  production  and marketing rather than upon our patent position 
however  we have followed a policy of filing applications for united states and foreign patents on inventions  designs  and improvements that we deem valuable 
employees as of may   we had approximately  employees worldwide  including retail and part time employees 
management considers its relationship with employees to be excellent 
none of our employees are represented by a union  except for certain employees in the emerging markets geography  where local law requires those employees to be represented by a trade union  and in the united states  where certain employees of cole haan are represented by a union 
also  in some countries outside of the united states  local laws require representation for employees by works councils such as in certain countries in the european union  in which they are entitled to information and consultation on certain company decisions or other employee representation by an organization similar to a union  and in certain european countries  we are required by local law to enter into and or comply with industry wide or national collective bargaining agreements 
there has never been a material interruption of operations due to labor disagreements

investors should also be aware that while nike does  from time to time  communicate with securities analysts  it is against nike s policy to disclose to them any material non public information or other confidential commercial information 
accordingly  shareholders should not assume that nike agrees with any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of the statement or report

our products face intense competition 
nike is a consumer products company and the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products 
the athletic footwear  apparel  and equipment industry is keenly competitive in the united states and on a worldwide basis 
we compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure shoe companies  athletic and leisure apparel companies  sports equipment companies  and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure shoes  apparel  and equipment 
we also compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers that produce our products and for import quota capacity 
our competitors product offerings  technologies  marketing expenditures including expenditures for advertising and endorsements  pricing  costs of production  and customer service are areas of intense competition 
this  in addition to rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel  and athletic equipment  constitute significant risk factors in our operations 
if we do not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to our competitors  our costs may increase or the consumer demand for our products may decline significantly 
failure to maintain our reputation and brand image could negatively impact our business 
our iconic brands have worldwide recognition  and our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand image and reputation 
maintaining  promoting and growing our brands will depend on our design and marketing efforts  including advertising and consumer campaigns  as well as product innovation 
we could be adversely impacted if we fail to achieve any of these objectives or if the reputation or image of any of our brands is tarnished or receives negative publicity 
in addition  adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us could damage our reputation and brand image  undermine our customers confidence in us and reduce long term demand for our products  even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations 
in addition  our success in maintaining  extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment  including our increasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns 
negative posts or comments about us on social networking web sites could seriously damage our reputation and brand image 
if we do not maintain  extend and expand our brand image  then our product sales  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
if we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and develop new products  we may not be able to maintain or increase our net revenues and profits 
our success depends on our ability to identify  originate and define product trends as well as to anticipate  gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner 
all of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty 
our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance or other sports apparel or away from these types of products altogether  and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes 
if 
table of contents we fail to anticipate accurately and respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings  developing new products  designs  styles and categories  and influencing sports and fitness preferences through aggressive marketing  we could experience lower sales  excess inventories and lower profit margins  any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  we market our products globally through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs and campaigns  including social media and online advertising 
if we do not successfully market our products or if advertising and promotional costs increase  these factors could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operation 
we rely on technical innovation and high quality products to compete in the market for our products 
technical innovation and quality control in the design and manufacturing process of footwear  apparel  and athletic equipment is essential to the commercial success of our products 
research and development plays a key role in technical innovation 
we rely upon specialists in the fields of biomechanics  exercise physiology  engineering  industrial design and related fields  as well as research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes  coaches  trainers  equipment managers  orthopedists  podiatrists  and other experts to develop and test cutting edge performance products 
while we strive to produce products that help to reduce injury  enhance athletic performance and maximize comfort  if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products  consumer demand for our products could decline  and if we experience problems with the quality of our products  we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems 
failure to continue to obtain high quality endorsers of our products could harm our business 
we establish relationships with professional athletes  sports teams and leagues to evaluate  promote  and establish product authenticity with consumers 
if certain endorsers were to stop using our products contrary to their endorsement agreements  our business could be adversely affected 
in addition  actions taken by athletes  teams or leagues associated with our products that harm the reputations of those athletes  teams or leagues could also harm our brand image with consumers and  as a result  could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition 
in addition  poor performance by our endorsers  a failure to continue to correctly identify promising athletes to use and endorse our products  or a failure to enter into cost effective endorsement arrangements with prominent athletes and sports organizations could adversely affect our brand and result in decreased sales of our products 
failure of our contractors or our licensees contractors to comply with our code of conduct  local laws  and other standards could harm our business 
we work with hundreds of contractors outside of the united states to manufacture our products  and we also have license agreements that permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture or contract to manufacture products using our trademarks 
we impose  and require our licensees to impose  on those contractors a code of conduct and other environmental  health  and safety standards for the benefit of workers 
we also require these contractors to comply with applicable standards for product safety 
however  from time to time contractors may not comply with such standards or applicable local law or our licensees may not require their contractors to comply with such standards or applicable local law 
significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more contractors could harm our reputation or result in a product recall and  as a result  could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition 
global capital and credit market conditions  and resulting declines in consumer confidence and spending  could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
the uncertain state of the global economy continues to impact businesses around the world 
the current political and economic global environment has resulted in continued economic unpredictability  particularly in europe where there are concerns regarding the increased debt levels of certain countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations  as well as the overall stability of the euro currency 
continuing volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets have led to a tightening of business credit and liquidity  a contraction of consumer credit  business failures  higher unemployment  and declines in consumer confidence and spending in many parts of the world 
if global economic and financial market conditions deteriorate or remain weak for an extended period of time  the following factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition slower consumer spending may result in reduced demand for our products  reduced orders from retailers for our products  order cancellations  lower revenues  increased inventories  and lower gross margins 
we may be unable to find suitable investments that are safe  liquid  and provide a reasonable return 
this could result in lower interest income or longer investment horizons 
disruptions to capital markets or the banking system may also impair the value of investments or bank deposits we currently consider safe or liquid 
we may be unable to access financing in the credit and capital markets at reasonable rates in the event we find it desirable to do so 
the failure of financial institution counterparties to honor their obligations to us under credit and derivative instruments could jeopardize our ability to rely on and benefit from those instruments 
our ability to replace those instruments on the same or similar terms may be limited under poor market conditions 
we conduct transactions in various currencies  which increase our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar 
continued volatility in the markets and exchange rates for foreign currencies and contracts in foreign currencies could have a significant impact on our reported financial results and condition 
continued volatility and availability in the markets and prices for commodities and raw materials we use in our products and in our supply chain such as petroleum could have a material adverse effect on our costs  gross margins  and profitability 
if retailers of our products experience declining revenues  or retailers experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase our products  this could result in reduced orders for our products  order cancellations  inability of retailers to timely meet their payment obligations to us  extended payment terms  higher accounts receivable  reduced cash flows  greater expense associated with collection efforts  and increased bad debt expense 
if retailers of our products experience severe financial difficulty  some may become insolvent and cease business operations  which could reduce the availability of our products to consumers 
if contract manufacturers of our products or other participants in our supply chain experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase raw materials or to finance general working capital needs  it may result in delays or non delivery of shipments of our products 
our business is affected by seasonality  which could result in fluctuations in our operating results and stock price 
we experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year 
historically  revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third fiscal quarters 
however  the mix of product sales may vary considerably from time to time as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear  apparel and equipment 
in addition  our customers may cancel orders  change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice 
as a result  we may not be able to accurately predict our quarterly sales 
accordingly  our results of operations are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period 
this seasonality  along with other factors that are beyond our control  including general economic conditions  changes in consumer 
table of contents preferences  weather conditions  availability of import quotas and currency exchange rate fluctuations  could adversely affect our business and cause our results of operations to fluctuate 
our operating margins are also sensitive to a number of factors that are beyond our control  including manufacturing and transportation costs  shifts in product sales mix  geographic sales trends  and currency exchange rate fluctuations  all of which we expect to continue 
results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period 
futures orders may not be an accurate indication of our future revenues 
we make substantial use of our futures ordering program  which allows retailers to order five to six months in advance of delivery with the commitment that their orders will be delivered within a set period of time at a fixed price 
our futures ordering program allows us to minimize the amount of products we hold in inventory  purchasing costs  the time necessary to fill customer orders  and the risk of non delivery 
we report changes in futures orders in our periodic financial reports 
although we believe futures orders are an important indicator of our future revenues  reported futures orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of changes in revenues for any future period 
this is because the mix of orders can shift between futures and at once orders 
in addition  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  order cancellations  shipping timing  returns  and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues 
moreover  a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders  including at once and close out sales of nike brand footwear and apparel  sales of nike brand equipment  sales from our direct to consumer operations  and sales from our other businesses 
our futures ordering program does not prevent excess inventories or inventory shortages  which could result in decreased operating margins and harm to our business 
we purchase products from manufacturers outside of our futures ordering program and in advance of customer orders  which we hold in inventory and resell to customers 
there is a risk we may be unable to sell excess products ordered from manufacturers 
inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write downs  and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices could significantly impair our brand image and have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
conversely  if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply products we require at the time we need them  we may experience inventory shortages 
inventory shortages might delay shipments to customers  negatively impact retailer and distributor relationships  and diminish brand loyalty 
the difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations and financial condition from period to period 
a failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely affect our net revenues and net income  and we are unlikely to forecast such effects with any certainty in advance 
we may be adversely affected by the financial health of our retailers 
we extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customer s financial condition  generally without requiring collateral 
to assist in the scheduling of production and the shipping of seasonal products  we offer customers the ability to place orders five to six months ahead of delivery under our futures ordering program 
these advance orders may be cancelled  and the risk of cancellation may increase when dealing with financially ailing retailers or retailers struggling with economic uncertainty 
in the past  some customers have experienced financial difficulties  which have had an adverse effect on our business 
as a result  retailers may be more cautious than usual with orders as a result of weakness in the retail economy 
a slowing economy in our key markets could have an adverse effect on the financial health of our customers  which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  product sales are dependent in part on high quality merchandising and an appealing store environment to attract consumers  which requires continuing investments by retailers 
retailers who experience financial difficulties may fail to make such investments or delay them  resulting in lower sales and orders for our products 
consolidation of retailers or concentration of retail market share among a few retailers may increase and concentrate our credit risk  and impair our ability to sell our products 
the athletic footwear  apparel  and equipment retail markets in some countries are dominated by a few large athletic footwear  apparel  and equipment retailers with many stores 
these retailers have in the past increased their market share and may continue to do so in the future by expanding through acquisitions and construction of additional stores 
these situations concentrate our credit risk with a relatively small number of retailers  and  if any of these retailers were to experience a shortage of liquidity  it would increase the risk that their outstanding payables to us may not be paid 
in addition  increasing market share concentration among one or a few retailers in a particular country or region increases the risk that if any one of them substantially reduces their purchases of our products  we may be unable to find a sufficient number of other retail outlets for our products to sustain the same level of sales and revenues 
failure to adequately protect our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business 
we utilize trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe that having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods  in identifying us  and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others 
we consider our nike and swoosh design trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in almost jurisdictions 
in addition  we own many other trademarks that we utilize in marketing our products 
we believe that our trademarks  patents  and other intellectual property rights are important to our brand  our success  and our competitive position 
we periodically discover products that are counterfeit reproductions of our products or that otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights 
if we are unsuccessful in challenging a party s products on the basis of trademark or design or utility patent infringement  continued sales of these products could adversely affect our sales and our brand and result in the shift of consumer preference away from our products 
the actions we take to establish and protect trademarks  patents  and other intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violations of proprietary rights 
we may be subject to liability if third parties successfully claim that we infringe their trademarks  patents  or other intellectual property rights 
defending infringement claims could be expensive and time consuming and might result in our entering into costly license agreements 
we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain products 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
we may face significant expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights outside the united states  and if we are unable to successfully protect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others  our business or financial condition may be adversely affected 
we are subject to periodic litigation and other regulatory proceedings  which could result in unexpected expense of time and resources 
from time to time we are called upon to defend ourselves against lawsuits and regulatory actions relating to our business 
due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings  we cannot accurately 
table of contents predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings 
an unfavorable outcome could have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  any significant litigation in the future  regardless of its merits  could divert management s attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees 
our international operations involve inherent risks which could result in harm to our business 
virtually all of our athletic footwear and apparel is manufactured outside of the united states  and the majority of our products are sold outside of the united states 
accordingly  we are subject to the risks generally associated with global trade and doing business abroad  which include foreign laws and regulations  varying consumer preferences across geographic regions  political unrest  disruptions or delays in cross border shipments  and changes in economic conditions in countries in which we manufacture or sell products 
in addition  disease outbreaks  terrorist acts and military conflict have increased the risks of doing business abroad 
these factors  among others  could affect our ability to manufacture products or procure materials  our ability to import products  our ability to sell products in international markets  and our cost of doing business 
if any of these or other factors make the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical  our business could be adversely affected 
in addition  many of our imported products are subject to duties  tariffs  or quotas that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the united states and other countries 
any country in which our products are produced or sold may eliminate  adjust or impose new quotas  duties  tariffs  safeguard measures  anti dumping duties  cargo restrictions to prevent terrorism  restrictions on the transfer of currency  climate change legislation  product safety regulations or other charges or restrictions  any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and profitability 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
our effective income tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by a number of factors  including changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates  changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities  changes in tax laws  the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions around the world  and any repatriation of non us earnings for which we have not previously provided for us taxes 
we regularly assess all of these matters to determine the adequacy of our tax provision  which is subject to significant discretion 
currency exchange rate fluctuations could result in lower revenues  higher costs and decreased margins and earnings 
a majority of our products are sold outside of the united states 
as a result  we conduct transactions in various currencies  which increase our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar 
our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in foreign currencies  and these revenues and expenses could be affected by currency fluctuations  including amounts recorded in foreign currencies and translated into us dollars for consolidated financial reporting 
currency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of the independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance 
foreign currency fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our hedging activities see note risk management and derivatives in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements  which are designed to minimize and delay  but not to completely eliminate  the effects of foreign currency fluctuations may not sufficiently mitigate the impact of foreign currencies on our financial results 
factors that could affect the effectiveness of our hedging activities include accuracy of sales forecasts  volatility of currency markets  and the availability of hedging instruments 
since the hedging activities are designed to minimize volatility  they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger us dollar  but they also reduce the positive impact of a weaker us dollar 
our future financial results could be significantly affected by the value of the us dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business 
the degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities 
our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing  manufacturing  and financing 
the principal materials used in our apparel products natural and synthetic fabrics and threads  plastic and metal hardware  and specialized performance fabrics designed to repel rain  retain heat  or efficiently transport body moisture are available in countries where our manufacturing takes place 
the principal materials used in our footwear products natural and synthetic rubber  plastic compounds  foam cushioning materials  nylon  leather  canvas and polyurethane films are also locally available to manufacturers 
nike contractors and suppliers buy raw materials in bulk 
there could be a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or  in the event of a disruption  we might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price  or at all 
in addition  we cannot be certain that our unaffiliated manufacturers will be able to fill our orders in a timely manner 
if we experience significant increases in demand  or reductions in the availability of materials  or need to replace an existing manufacturer  there can be no assurance that additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us  or at all  or that any supplier or manufacturer would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements 
in addition  even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or sources of materials  we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train suppliers and manufacturers in our methods  products  quality control standards  and labor  health and safety standards 
any delays  interruption or increased costs in the supply of materials or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower revenues and net income both in the short and long term 
because independent manufacturers manufacture a majority of our products outside of our principal sales markets  our products must be transported by third parties over large geographic distances 
delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation  work stoppages  port strikes  infrastructure congestion  or other factors  and costs and delays associated with consolidating or transitioning between manufacturers  could adversely impact our financial performance 
in addition  manufacturing delays or unexpected demand for our products may require us to use faster  but more expensive  transportation methods such as aircraft  which could adversely affect our profit margins 
the cost of fuel is a significant component in manufacturing and transportation costs  so increases in the price of petroleum products can adversely affect our profit margins 
in addition  sojitz america performs significant import export financing services for most of the nike brand products sold outside of the united states  europe  middle east  africa  and japan  excluding products produced and sold in the same country 
any failure of sojitz america to provide these services or any failure of sojitz america s banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers outside of the united states  europe  middle east  africa  and japan 
such a disruption could result in cancelled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability 
natural disasters could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 
natural disasters such as earthquakes  hurricanes  tsunamis or other adverse weather and climate conditions  whether occurring in the us or abroad  and the consequences and effects thereof  including energy shortages and public health issues  could disrupt our operations  or the operations of our vendors and other suppliers  or result in economic instability that may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

table of contents our success depends on our global distribution facilities 
we distribute our products to customers directly from the factory and through distribution centers located throughout the world 
our ability to meet customer expectations  manage inventory  complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies depends on the proper operation of our distribution facilities  the development or expansion of additional distribution capabilities  and the timely performance of services by third parties including those involved in shipping product to and from our distribution facilities 
our distribution facilities could be interrupted by information technology problems and disasters such as earthquakes or fires 
any significant failure in our distribution facilities could result in an adverse affect on our business 
we maintain business interruption insurance  but it may not adequately protect us from adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities 
we rely significantly on information technology to operate our business  including our supply chain and retail operations  and any failure  inadequacy  breach  interruption or security failure of that technology or any misappropriation of any data could harm our reputation or our ability to effectively operate our business 
we are heavily dependent on information technology systems and networks  including the internet and third party hosted services information technology systems  across our supply chain  including product design  production  forecasting  ordering  manufacturing  transportation  sales  and distribution  as well as for processing financial information for external and internal reporting purposes and other business activities 
our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and to ship products to customers on a timely basis depends significantly on the reliability of these information technology systems 
over the last several years  as part of the ongoing initiative to upgrade our worldwide supply chain  we have implemented new information technology systems in all of the geographical regions in which we operate 
over the next few years  we will work to continue to enhance these systems and related processes in our global operations 
the failure of these systems to operate effectively  problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems  or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations  could require significant capital investments to remediate the problem  and may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we also use information technology systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting  legal and tax requirements 
if our information technology systems suffer severe damage  disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner  we could experience delays in reporting our financial results  which could result in lost revenues and profits  as well as reputational damage 
in addition  hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate large scale and complex automated attacks 
any breach of our network may result in the loss of valuable business data  our customers or employees personal information or a disruption of our business  which could give rise to unwanted media attention  damage our customer relationships and reputation and result in lost sales  fines or lawsuits 
in addition  we must comply with increasingly complex regulatory standards enacted to protect this business and personal data 
an inability to maintain compliance with these regulatory standards could subject us to legal risks 
furthermore  we depend on information technology systems for digital marketing campaigns and activities and electronic communications throughout the world between and among our employees as well as with other third parties  such as other customers  suppliers and consumers 
our information technology systems are critical to many of our operating activities and our business processes may be negatively impacted by any service interruption or shutdown 
misuse  leakage or falsification of information could result in a violation of data privacy laws and regulations and damage our reputation and credibility and have a negative impact on revenues and profits 
our financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses and operations fail to produce expected returns 
from time to time  we may invest in business infrastructure  acquisitions of new businesses  product offering and manufacturing innovation  and expansion of existing businesses  such as our retail operations  which require substantial cash investments and management attention 
we believe cost effective investments are essential to business growth and profitability 
however  significant investments are subject to typical risks and uncertainties inherent in acquiring or expanding a business 
the failure of any significant investment to provide the returns or profitability we expect could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and divert management attention from more profitable business operations 
we depend on key personnel  the loss of whom would harm our business 
our future success will depend in part on the continued service of key executive officers and personnel 
the loss of the services of any key individual could harm us 
our future success also depends on our ability to identify  attract and retain additional qualified personnel 
competition for employees in our industry is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
the sale of a large number of shares held by our chairman could depress the market price of our common stock 
philip h 
knight  co founder and chairman of our board of directors  beneficially owns over of our class a common stock 
if all of his class a common stock were converted into class b common stock  mr 
knight would own over of our class b common stock 
these shares are available for resale  subject to the requirements of the us securities laws 
the sale or prospect of the sale of a substantial number of these shares could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
anti takeover provisions may impair an acquisition of the company or reduce the price of our common stock 
there are provisions of our articles of incorporation and oregon law that are intended to protect shareholder interests by providing the board of directors a means to attempt to deny coercive takeover attempts or to negotiate with a potential acquirer in order to obtain more favorable terms 
such provisions include a control share acquisition statute  a freeze out statute  two classes of stock that vote separately on certain issues  and the fact that holders of class a common stock elect three fourths of the board of directors rounded down to the next whole number 
however  such provisions could discourage  delay or prevent an unsolicited merger  acquisition or other change in control of our company that some shareholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which shareholders might receive a premium for their common stock over the prevailing market price 
these provisions could also discourage proxy contests for control of the company 
we may fail to meet analyst expectations  which could cause the price of our stock to decline 
our class b common stock is traded publicly  and at any given time various securities analysts follow our financial results and issue reports on us 
these reports include information about our historical financial results as well as the analysts estimates of our future performance 
the analysts estimates are based upon their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations 
if our operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors  our stock price could decline 
in the past  securities class action litigation has been brought against nike and other companies following a decline in the market price of their securities 
if our stock price is volatile  we may become involved in this type of litigation in the future 
any litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations nike designs  develops  markets and sells high quality footwear  apparel  equipment  accessories and services worldwide 
we are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world 
we sell our products to retail accounts  through nike owned retail stores and internet sales  which we refer to as our direct to consumer operations  and through a mix of independent distributors  licensees and sales representatives  worldwide 
our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear  apparel  equipment  accessories and service businesses 
our strategy is to achieve long term revenue growth by creating innovative  must have products  building deep personal consumer connections with our brands  and delivering compelling consumer experiences at retail and online 
in addition to achieving long term revenue growth  we continue to strive to deliver shareholder value by driving operational excellence in several key areas expanding gross margin by making our supply chain a competitive advantage  reducing product costs through a continued focus on manufacturing efficiency  product design and innovation  utilizing price increases to effectively manage the price to value equation for our customers 
improving selling and administrative expense productivity by focusing on investments that drive economic returns in the form of incremental revenue and gross profit  and leveraging existing infrastructure across our portfolio of businesses to eliminate duplicative costs  improving working capital efficiency  and deploying capital effectively 
through execution of this strategy  our long term financial goals continue to be high single digit revenue growth  mid teens earnings per share growth  increased return on invested capital and accelerated cash flows  and consistent results through effective management of our diversified portfolio of businesses 
over the past ten years  we have achieved or exceeded all of these financial goals 
during this time  nike  inc s revenues and earnings per share have grown and  respectively  on an annual compounded basis 
our return on invested capital has increased from to and we expanded gross margins by percentage points 
our fiscal results demonstrated our continued focus toward delivering appropriate returns to our shareholders  while positioning ourselves for sustainable  profitable long term growth 
despite the ongoing challenges in the global economy  we delivered record revenues and earnings per share in fiscal our revenues grew to billion  net income increased to billion  and we delivered diluted earnings per share of  an increase from fiscal income before income taxes increased for fiscal  driven by revenue growth and improved leverage on selling and administrative expense  which more than offset a decrease in gross margin and an increase in other expense 
the increase in revenues was driven by growth across all nike brand geographies  key categories and product types 
brand strength  innovative products and strong category retail presentation continues to fuel the demand for our nike brand products 
during fiscal  we introduced a number of innovations  including the nike fuelband and the flyknit technology 
the nike fuelband is a digital device that tracks one s daily activities through a sport tested accelerometer  while flyknit is a new footwear technology that uses advanced materials and proprietary manufacturing technology to produce a form fitting  lightweight and seamless upper 
during this time  we also expanded our nike platform into our basketball and training categories  and launched new high performance uniforms for all nfl teams 
revenue for our other businesses also grew  reflective of growth across most businesses  led by converse 
our gross margin continued to be impacted by higher product input costs  including materials and labor  which more than offset the positive impacts of higher product selling prices  the growth of our direct to consumer business and benefits from ongoing product cost reduction initiatives 
for fiscal  the growth of our net income was negatively affected by a year over year increase in our effective tax rate 
however  diluted earnings per share grew at a higher rate than net income due to a decrease in the weighted average number of diluted common shares outstanding  driven by share repurchases during fiscal and as part of our long term growth strategy  we continually evaluate our existing portfolio of businesses to ensure the company is investing in those businesses that are accretive to the nike brand  and with the largest growth potential and highest returns 
on may   we announced our intention to divest of the cole haan and umbro businesses  which will allow us to focus our resources on driving growth in the nike  jordan  converse and hurley brands

while we will continue to face headwinds from higher input costs and foreign exchange volatility in fiscal  we continue to see opportunities to drive future growth and remain committed to effectively managing our business to achieve our financial goals over the long term  by executing against the operational strategies outlined above

upon the sale of the business  or when the ultimate selling price becomes estimable  we expect to incur non cash charges to liquidate certain balance sheet accounts  most significantly the cumulative translation adjustment and deferred tax assets related to umbro 
at may   the cumulative translation adjustment was million  net of tax  and the deferred tax asset was million 
we may also incur other cash and non cash charges related to the divestiture of the cole haan and umbro businesses 
fiscal compared to fiscal for fiscal  the revenue growth at converse was primarily driven by increased licensing revenue in china  as well as increased sales in the uk as we transitioned that market to direct distribution 
revenues for cole haan increased  driven by double digit percentage growth in our wholesale operations as well as high single digit percentage growth in our direct to consumer operations 
revenues declined at nike golf  where we experienced significant erosion in our japan business following the earthquake and tsunami in march for fiscal  ebit for our other businesses grew at a faster rate than revenues  primarily as a result of more favorable foreign currency exchange impacts 
gross margin remained relatively flat for fiscal  as the favorable impact from improved product mix was offset by a lower mix of licensee revenues 
selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues remained relatively flat for fiscal corporate dollars in millions fiscal fiscal fy vs

fy change revenues loss before interest and taxes corporate consists largely of unallocated general and administrative expenses  including expenses associated with centrally managed departments  depreciation and amortization related to our corporate headquarters  unallocated insurance  benefit and compensation programs  including stock based compensation  certain foreign currency gains and losses  including certain hedge gains and losses  corporate eliminations and other items 
corporate revenues primarily consist of certain intercompany revenue eliminations and foreign currency hedge gains and losses related to revenues generated by entities within the nike brand geographic operating segments and other businesses but managed through our central foreign exchange risk management program 
in addition to the foreign currency gains and losses recognized in corporate revenues  foreign currency results include all other foreign currency hedge results generated through our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program  other conversion gains and losses arising from re measurement of monetary assets and liabilities in non functional currencies  and gains and losses resulting from the difference between actual foreign currency rates and standard rates used to record non functional currency denominated product purchases within the nike brand geographic operating segments and other businesses 

table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal for fiscal  corporate expense grew million  mainly due to an increase of million in performance based compensation and a year over year net increase of million from foreign currency impacts 
these foreign currency impacts were driven by a year over year increase in foreign currency net losses  arising from certain euro us dollar foreign currency hedges and the re measurement of monetary assets and liabilities in various non functional currencies  net of related undesignated forward instruments  as a variety of foreign currencies weakened against the us dollar year over year 
the above impacts were partially offset by a slight decrease in centrally managed operating overhead expenses 
fiscal compared to fiscal for fiscal  the decrease in corporate expense was primarily driven by year over year net foreign currency gains generated by our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program 
also contributing to the decrease in corporate expense for fiscal was a million year over year reduction in stock options expense primarily due to a change in accelerated vesting provisions that took effect in the first quarter of fiscal and a lower estimated fair value for stock options granted in the current year 
these benefits more than offset an increase in corporate operating overhead expenses  primarily driven by higher wage related expense 
foreign currency exposures and hedging practices overview as a global company with significant operations outside the united states  in the normal course of business we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates 
our primary foreign currency exposures arise from the recording of transactions denominated in non functional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations  financial position and cash flows  such as the euro and chinese renminbi  into us dollars 
our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our reported consolidated results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
we manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks that are material to nike  inc we manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio  and where practical  by hedging a portion of the remaining material exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options 
as described below  the implementation of our foreign currency adjustment program enhanced our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk on a portfolio basis by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits that exist within our portfolio of aggregate foreign exchange exposure 
our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying net exposures being hedged 
where hedged  our program has the effect of delaying the impact of current market rates on our consolidated financial statements  the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons 
we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
transactional exposures we conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk 
our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are product costs nike s product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways non functional currency denominated product purchases a 
certain nike entities purchase product from the nike trading company ntc  a wholly owned centralized sourcing hub that buys nike branded products from external factories  predominantly in us dollars 
the ntc  whose functional currency is the us dollar  then sells the products to nike entities in their respective functional currencies 
when the ntc sells to a nike entity with a different functional currency  the result is a foreign currency exposure for the ntc 
b 
other nike entities purchase product directly from external factories in us dollars 
these purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those nike entities with a functional currency other than the us dollar 
in both purchasing scenarios  a weaker us dollar reduces the inventory cost incurred by nike whereas a stronger us dollar increases its cost 
factory input costs in january  nike implemented a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories 
the program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories foreign currency exposures  some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures 
under this program  our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies factory currency exposure index in which the labor  materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of nike branded products factory input costs are denominated 
for the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory  the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within inventories and is recognized in cost of sales when the related product is sold to a third party 
all currencies within the indices  excluding the us dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory  are recognized as embedded derivatives and are recorded at fair value through other expense income  net 
refer to note risk management and derivatives for additional detail 
as an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating us dollar on our non functional currency denominated product purchases described above  a strengthening us dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices decreases nike s us dollar inventory cost 
conversely  a weakening us dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost 
non functional currency denominated external sales a portion of our western europe and central eastern europe geography revenues are earned in currencies other than the euro eg british pound  polish zloty but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the euro as its functional currency 
these sales generate a foreign currency exposure 
other costs non functional currency denominated costs  such as endorsement contracts  intercompany royalties and other intercompany charges  generate foreign currency risk to a lesser extent 
non functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities  primarily receivables and payables  denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies 
these balance sheet items are subject to re measurement  which may create fluctuations in other expense income  net within our consolidated results of operations 

table of contents managing transactional exposures transactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program 
we manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows  including certain product cost exposures  non functional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above 
these are accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging  except for hedges of the embedded derivatives component of the product costs exposure as discussed below 
as of may   there were outstanding currency forward contracts with maturities up to months 
the fair value of outstanding currency forward contracts at may  and was million and million in assets and million and million in liabilities  respectively 
the effective portion of the changes in fair value of these instruments is reported in other comprehensive income oci  a component of shareholders equity  and reclassified into earnings in the same financial statement line item and in the same period or periods during which the related hedged transactions affect consolidated earnings 
the ineffective portion is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of other expense income  net 
ineffectiveness was not material for the years ended may   and certain currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of non functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities subject to re measurement and the embedded derivative contracts discussed above are not formally designated as hedging instruments under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging 
accordingly  changes in fair value of these instruments are immediately recognized in other expense income  net and are intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the re measurement of the related non functional currency denominated asset or liability or the embedded derivative contract being hedged 
the fair value of undesignated instruments was million and million in assets and million and million in liabilities at may  and  respectively 
refer to note fair value measurements and note risk management and derivatives in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded 
translational exposures many of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets  operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into us dollars for consolidated reporting 
the translation of foreign subsidiaries non us dollar denominated balance sheets into us dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to oci within shareholders equity 
in the translation of our consolidated statements of income  a weaker us dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger us dollar reduces our consolidated earnings 
the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated revenues was a benefit detriment of approximately million and million for the years ended may  and  respectively 
the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our income before income taxes was a benefit detriment of approximately million and million for the years ended may  and  respectively 
managing translational exposures to minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into us dollars for consolidated reporting  certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase us dollar denominated available for sale investments 
the variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these us dollar denominated securities at us dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging 
we utilize forward contracts and or options to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these us dollar investments 
the combination of the purchase and sale of the us dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the year over year foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold 
hedges of available for sale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges 
the fair value of instruments used in this manner at may  and was million and million in assets and million and million in liabilities  respectively 
the effective portion of the changes in fair value of these instruments is reported in oci and reclassified into earnings in other expense income  net in the period during which the hedged available for sale investment is sold and affects earnings 
any ineffective portion is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of other expense income  net 
the impact of ineffective hedges was not material for any period presented 
the combination of translation of foreign currency denominated profits from our international businesses and the year over year change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in other expense income  net had an insignificant impact on our income before income taxes for the year ended may  and had a unfavorable impact of approximately million for the year ended may  refer to note fair value measurements and note risk management and derivatives in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded 
net investments in foreign subsidiaries we are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in wholly owned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the us dollar  which could adversely impact the us dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings 
we hedge certain net investment positions in euro functional currency foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investments 
in accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging  the effective portion of the change in fair value of the forward contracts designated as net investment hedges is recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
any ineffective portion is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of other expense income  net 
the impact of ineffective hedges was not material for any period presented 
to minimize credit risk  we have structured these net investment hedges to be generally less than six months in duration 
upon maturity  the hedges are settled based on the current fair value of the forward contracts with the realized gain or loss remaining in oci 
there were no outstanding net investment hedges as of may  at may   the fair value was million in liabilities 
cash flows from net investment hedge settlements totaled million and million for the years ended may  and  respectively 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash flow activity cash provided by operations was billion for fiscal compared to billion for fiscal our primary source of operating cash flow for fiscal was net income of billion 
our working capital was a net cash outflow of million for fiscal as compared to a net cash outflow of million for fiscal our investments in working capital increased primarily due to an increase in inventory and prepaid expenses 
inventory at the end of fiscal increased compared to fiscal  primarily due to higher product input costs as well as changes in product mix  which more than offset the favorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates 
inventory units for the nike brand grew compared to the prior year  driven by growth in futures orders and improved factory deliveries 
the increase in prepaid expenses was primarily driven by higher prepaid demand creation expenses around the european football championships and london summer olympics 
cash provided by investing activities was million during fiscal  compared to a use of cash of  million for fiscal the year over year increase was primarily due to higher net sales and maturities of short term investments of  million net of purchases in fiscal  compared to net purchases of million net of sales and maturities during fiscal cash used by financing activities was billion for fiscal compared to billion for fiscal the increase in cash used by financing activities was primarily due to higher payments of long term debt  notes payable  and dividends  which was partially offset by an increase in the proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
in fiscal  we purchased million shares of nike s class b common stock for billion 
these repurchases were made under the four year  billion program approved by our board of directors in september  under which stock repurchase activities commenced in december as of the end of fiscal  we have repurchased million shares for billion under this program 
we continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flow  excess cash  and or debt 
the timing and the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions 
capital resources on november   we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to billion of borrowings pursuant to a revolving credit facility with the option to increase borrowings to billon with lender approval 
the facility matures in november  with a one year extension option prior to both the second and third anniversary of the closing date  provided that extensions shall not extend beyond november  this facility replaces the prior billion committed credit facility agreement that would have expired in december as of and for the year ended may   we had no amounts outstanding under our new committed revolving credit facility 
we currently have long term debt ratings of a and a from standard and poor s corporation and moody s investor services  respectively 
if our long term debt rating were to decline  the facility fee and interest rate under our committed revolving credit facility would increase 
conversely  if our long term debt rating were to improve  the facility fee and interest rate would decrease 
changes in our long term debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility 
under this committed revolving credit facility  we have agreed to various covenants 
these covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets  the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur  as well as a minimum capitalization ratio 
in the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility and failed to meet any covenant  and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate  any borrowings would become immediately due and payable 
as of may   we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future 
liquidity is also provided by our billion commercial paper program 
as of and for the year ended may   no amounts were outstanding under this program 
we may issue commercial paper from time to time during fiscal depending on general corporate needs 
we currently have short term debt ratings of a and p from standard and poor s corporation and moody s investor services  respectively 
our previous million shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission expired during fiscal no debt securities were issued under that shelf registration prior to its expiry 
we may issue debt securities under a new shelf registration in fiscal depending on general corporate needs 
as of may   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaling billion  of which billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries 
cash equivalents and short term investments consist primarily of deposits held at major banks  money market funds  tier commercial paper  corporate notes  us treasury obligations  us government sponsored enterprise obligations  and other investment grade fixed income securities 
our fixed income investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk 
all of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk 
while individual securities have varying durations  the average duration of our entire cash equivalents and short term investment portfolio is less than days as of may  despite recent uncertainties in the financial markets  to date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs 
future volatility in the capital markets  however  may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets 
we believe that existing cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and cash generated by operations  together with access to external sources of funds as described above  will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future 
we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where they are needed 
we routinely repatriate a portion of our foreign earnings for which us taxes have previously been provided 
we also indefinitely reinvest a significant portion of our foreign earnings  and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings 
should we require additional capital in the us  we may elect to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds or raise capital in the us through debt 
if we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds  we would be required to accrue and pay additional us taxes less applicable foreign tax credits 
if we elect to raise capital in the us through debt  we would incur additional interest expense 
off balance sheet arrangements in connection with various contracts and agreements  we provide routine indemnifications relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights  coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor 
currently  we have several such agreements in place 
however  based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss  we have determined that the fair value of such indemnifications is not material to our financial position or results of operations 

table of contents contractual obligations our significant long term contractual obligations as of may  and significant endorsement contracts entered into through the date of this report are as follows description of commitment cash payments due during the year ending may  in millions thereafter total operating leases long term debt endorsement contracts product purchase obligations  other total the amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete and sport team endorsers of our products 
actual payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements and or royalties on product sales in future periods 
actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods 
in addition to the cash payments  we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with nike product for their use 
it is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product 
the amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors  including general playing conditions  the number of sporting events in which they participate  and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives 
in addition  the costs to design  develop  source  and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers 
we generally order product at least to months in advance of sale based primarily on futures orders received from customers 
the amounts listed for product purchase obligations represent agreements including open purchase orders to purchase products in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms 
in some cases  prices are subject to change throughout the production process 
the reported amounts exclude product purchase liabilities included in accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheet as of may  other amounts primarily include service and marketing commitments made in the ordinary course of business 
the amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding contracts and agreements that specify all significant terms  including open purchase orders for non product purchases 
the reported amounts exclude those liabilities included in accounts payable or accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of may  the total liability for uncertain tax positions was million  excluding related interest and penalties  at may  we are not able to reasonably estimate when or if cash payments of the long term liability for uncertain tax positions will occur 
we also have the following outstanding short term debt obligations as of may  please refer to the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements note short term borrowings and credit lines for further description and interest rates related to the short term debt obligations listed below 
in millions outstanding as of may  notes payable  due at mutually agreed upon dates within one year of issuance or on demand payable to sojitz america for the purchase of inventories  generally due days after shipment of goods from a foreign port as of may   letters of credit of million were outstanding  which were generally issued for the purchase of inventory and as guarantees of the company s performance under certain self insurance and other programs 
recently adopted accounting standards in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new guidance to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements between us gaap and international financial reporting standards 
this new guidance  which became effective for us beginning march   amends current us gaap fair value measurement and disclosure guidance to include increased transparency around valuation inputs and investment categorization 
the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued guidance to amend the disclosure requirements related to recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements 
the guidance requires additional disclosures about the different classes of assets and liabilities measured at fair value  the valuation techniques and inputs used  the activity in level fair value measurements  and the transfers between levels   and of the fair value measurement hierarchy 
this guidance became effective for us beginning march   except for disclosures relating to purchases  sales  issuances and settlements of level assets and liabilities  which became effective for us beginning june  as this guidance only requires expanded disclosures  the adoption did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued new standards that revised the guidance for revenue recognition with multiple deliverables 
these new standards impact the determination of when the individual deliverables included in a multiple element arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting 
additionally  these new standards modify the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified deliverables by no longer permitting the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration 
these new standards became effective for us beginning june  the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

table of contents recently issued accounting standards in december  the fasb issued guidance enhancing disclosure requirements surrounding the nature of an entity s right to offset and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments 
this new guidance requires companies to disclose both gross and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instruments and transactions subject to master netting arrangements 
this new guidance is effective for us beginning june  as this guidance only requires expanded disclosures  we do not anticipate the adoption will have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued updated guidance on the periodic testing of goodwill for impairment 
this guidance will allow companies to assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that goodwill might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test required under current accounting standards 
this new guidance is effective for us beginning june  we do not expect the adoption will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income 
this new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of shareholders equity 
companies will now be required to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income in either one continuous statement  referred to as the statement of comprehensive income  or in two separate  but consecutive statements 
this guidance also required companies to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in both the statement in which net income is presented and the statement in which other comprehensive income is presented 
however  in december  the fasb issued guidance which indefinitely defers the requirement related to the presentation of reclassification adjustments 
both issuances on the presentation of comprehensive income are effective for us beginning june  as this guidance only amends the presentation of the components of comprehensive income  we do not anticipate the adoption will have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies our previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters  actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies 
certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances  including the policies for revenue recognition  the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable  inventory reserves  and contingent payments under endorsement contracts 
these policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date 
however  since our business cycle is relatively short  actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the six month period following the financial statement date 
thus  these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three fiscal quarters 
within the context of these critical accounting policies  we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported 
revenue recognition we record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer  based on the terms of sale 
title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer 
retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale 
in some instances  we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer 
our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods of up to several weeks 
in certain countries outside of the us  precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available 
in these cases  we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location 
on the basis of our tests of actual transactions  we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically 
as part of our revenue recognition policy  we record estimated sales returns  discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded 
we base our estimates on historical rates of product returns  discounts and claims  specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers  and estimated returns  discounts and claims expected but not yet finalized with our customers 
actual returns  discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates 
if actual or expected future returns  discounts and claims were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established  we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination 
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable we make ongoing estimates relating to the ability to collect our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in determining the amount of the allowance  we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations 
since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers  actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  a larger allowance might be required 
in the event we determine that a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate  we would record a credit or a charge to selling and administrative expense in the period in which such a determination is made 
inventory reserves we also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books  we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value 
this reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales 
if changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate  we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to cost of sales 

table of contents contingent payments under endorsement contracts a significant portion of our demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts 
in general  endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract 
however  certain contract elements may be accounted for differently  based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract 
some of the contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports eg  winning a championship 
we record selling and administrative expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal 
some of the contracts provide for payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time eg  maintaining a top ranking in a sport for a year 
these amounts are reported in selling and administrative expense when we determine that it is probable that the specified level of performance will be maintained throughout the period 
in these instances  to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorser s athletic performance  increased or decreased selling and administrative expense may be reported in a future period 
some of the contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percentage of sales of particular products 
we expense these payments in cost of sales as the related sales occur 
in certain contracts  we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments 
for contractual obligations for which we estimate we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product  we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in selling and administrative expense uniformly over the remaining guarantee period 
property  plant and equipment and definite lived assets property  plant and equipment  including buildings  equipment  and computer hardware and software are recorded at cost including  in some cases  the cost of internal labor and are depreciated over the estimated useful life 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances or changes to our business operations can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives 
in those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long lived asset should be shortened  we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the asset s net book value to its salvage value 
we review the carrying value of long lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable 
factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used  a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset  or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset  among others 
if such facts indicate a potential impairment  we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group 
if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable  we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies that would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows 
any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset group s carrying amount and its estimated fair value 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets we perform annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  or when events occur or circumstances change that would  more likely than not  reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value 
events or changes in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate  operating results  planned investments in the reporting unit  planned divestitures or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable  among other factors 
the impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis 
in step two of the analysis  we measure and record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill over its implied fair value if any 
we generally base our measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach 
the discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting unit to generate in the future 
our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include our weighted average cost of capital  long term rate of growth and profitability of the reporting unit s business  and working capital effects 
the market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the reporting unit to comparable publicly traded companies in similar lines of business 
significant estimates in the market valuation approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size  growth  profitability  risk and return on investment  and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit 
indefinite lived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks 
in measuring the fair value for these intangible assets  we utilize the relief from royalty method 
this method assumes that trade names and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them 
this method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands  the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital 
on may   we announced our intention to divest of the cole haan and umbro businesses 
as of may   cole haan had no goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets on our balance sheet  while umbro had million of goodwill and million of trademark and other intangible assets 
as of may   both asset groups for cole haan and umbro did not quality as assets held for sale under applicable accounting guidance 
the decision to divest these businesses was deemed a triggering event to perform an impairment analysis of umbro s intangible assets at that date and was considered in our fourth quarter impairment analysis 
we are currently in the process of preparing the businesses for divestiture and identifying potential acquirers 
therefore  we believe the weighted use of discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach is the best method for determining the fair value of the umbro reporting unit because these are the most common valuation methodologies used within our industry  and the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risks associated with either model if used on a stand alone basis 
as discussed above  the asset groups for umbro did not qualify as assets held for sale  therefore  we did not consider potential disposition costs or cumulative translation adjustments in the carrying value of the umbro reporting unit in our fiscal fourth quarter impairment analysis 
because we are still in the preliminary stages of the divestiture process and have not yet identified potential acquirers or the likely deal structure  these methods represent our best estimate of the fair value of the umbro business 
our analysis determined there was no impairment of intangible assets or goodwill related to umbro 
if the sales process indicates a fair value that is below the current carrying value of the reporting unit  an analysis would be required to determine if impairment charges exist at that point 

table of contents fair value measurements for financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis  fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date 
in general  and where applicable  we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair values of our financial instruments 
this pricing methodology applies to our level investments  including us treasury securities 
in the absence of active markets for identical assets or liabilities  such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data  including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active 
this pricing methodology applies to our level investments such as commercial paper and bonds  us agency securities and money market funds 
level investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs 
assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio 
a majority of our available for sale securities are priced by pricing vendors and are generally level or level investments  as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs without applying significant adjustments in their pricing 
observable inputs include broker quotes  interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals  volatilities and credit risks 
our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded 
these controls include an analysis of period over period fluctuations and comparison to another independent pricing vendor 
hedge accounting for derivatives we use forward and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency exchange transactions as well as certain non functional monetary assets and liabilities 
when the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met  changes in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in other comprehensive income  rather than net income  until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income 
in most cases  this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from other comprehensive income into net income some time after the maturity of the derivative 
one of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the forward and option contracts amount should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions 
by their very nature  our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions 
when anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decline below hedged levels  or if it is no longer probable that a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two month period of time thereafter  we are required to reclassify the cumulative changes in fair values of the over hedged portion of the related hedge contract from other comprehensive income to other expense income  net during the quarter in which such changes occur 
we use forward contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation related to our net investment in those subsidiaries 
the change in fair value of the forward contracts hedging our net investments is reported in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity  to the extent effective  to offset the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments 
as the value of our underlying net investments in wholly owned international subsidiaries is known at the time a hedge is placed  the designated hedge is matched to the portion of our net investment at risk 
accordingly  the variability involved in net investment hedges is substantially less than that of other types of hedge transactions and we do not expect any material ineffectiveness 
we consider  on a quarterly basis  the need to redesignate existing hedge relationships based on changes in the underlying net investment 
should the level of our net investment decrease below hedged levels  the cumulative change in fair value of the over hedged portion of the related hedge contract would be reported directly to earnings in the period in which changes occur 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation by estimating the fair value of stock based compensation on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including volatility 
expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in market traded options on our common stock with a term greater than one year  along with other factors 
our decision to use implied volatility was based on the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility 
if factors change and we use different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
taxes we record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets  when necessary 
realization of deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carry forwards is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain 
at least quarterly  we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset  which increases our income tax expense in the period when such determination is made 
in addition  we have not recorded us income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested outside the us  thus reducing our overall income tax expense 
the amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our us and foreign entities 
income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore 
we carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore and apply stringent standards to overcome the presumption of repatriation 
despite this approach  because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events  the possibility exists that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated 
for instance  the actual cash needs of our us entities may exceed our current expectations  or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations 
this would result in additional income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore 
conversely  our approach may also result in a determination that accumulated foreign earnings for which us income taxes have been provided will be indefinitely reinvested offshore 
in this case  our income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination 
on an interim basis  we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year 
this estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year to date pre tax income excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items  to determine the year to date tax expense 
the income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur 
as the fiscal year progresses  we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year 
this continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year 
when this occurs  we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs 
on a quarterly basis  we reevaluate the probability that a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  settled audit issues and new audit activity 
changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes 
we recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 

table of contents other contingencies in the ordinary course of business  we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships  product liability claims  trademark rights  and a variety of other matters 
we record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us  including related legal costs  when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors  including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts 
recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain 
if future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims  we would record additional charges as other expense income  net during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred 
in addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses  we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability 
while we cannot predict the outcome of pending legal matters with certainty  we do not believe any currently identified claim  proceeding or litigation  either individually or in aggregate  will have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures  we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates 
it is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures  we do not enter into these transactions for speculative purposes 
we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations  primarily as a result of our international sales  product sourcing and funding activities 
our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
we use forward exchange contracts and options to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables  including third party and intercompany transactions 
we also use forward contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation adjustments related to our net investment in those subsidiaries 
where hedged  our program has the effect of delaying the impact of current market rates on our consolidated financial statements dependent upon hedge horizons 
when we begin hedging exposures  the type and duration of each hedge depends on the nature of the exposure and market conditions 
generally  all anticipated and firmly committed transactions that are hedged are to be recognized within to months 
the majority of the contracts expiring in more than months relate to the anticipated purchase of inventory 
when intercompany loans are hedged  it is typically for their expected duration 
hedged transactions are principally denominated in euros  british pounds and japanese yen 
see section foreign currency exposures and hedging practices under item for additional detail 
our earnings are also exposed to movements in short and long term market interest rates 
our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we maintain a mix of commercial paper  bank loans and fixed rate debt of varying maturities and have entered into receive fixed  pay variable interest rate swaps 
market risk measurement we monitor foreign exchange risk  interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value  sensitivity analysis  and value at risk var 
our market sensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts  foreign currency option contracts  interest rate swaps  intercompany loans denominated in non functional currencies  fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt  and fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt 
we use var to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only 
the var determines the maximum potential one day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate sensitive financial instruments 
the var model estimates assume normal market conditions and a confidence level 
there are various modeling techniques that can be used in the var computation 
our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates a variance co variance technique 
these interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one year period 
the value of foreign currency options does not change on a one to one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate 
we adjust the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity the delta and gamma to changes in the underlying currency rate 
this calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on non functional currency transactions such as anticipated transactions  firm commitments  cash balances  and accounts and loans receivable and payable  including those which are hedged by these instruments 
the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur  nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates 
it also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur 
actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships  hedging instruments and hedge percentages  timing and other factors 
the estimated maximum one day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments  derived using the var model  was million and million at may  and  respectively 
the var decreased year over year primarily as a result of decreased foreign currency volatilities at may  such a hypothetical loss in fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged 
the average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was million and million during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the instruments not included in the var are intercompany loans denominated in non functional currencies  fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt  fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps 
intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation 
furthermore  our non functional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts  which are included in the var calculation above 
therefore  we consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with our non functional currency intercompany loans to be immaterial to our consolidated financial position  results from operations and cash flows 
details of third party debt and interest rate swaps are provided in the table below 
the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
weighted average interest rates for the fixed rate swapped to floating rate debt reflect the effective interest rates as of may  
table of contents expected maturity date year ending may  dollars in millions thereafter total fair value foreign exchange risk japanese yen functional currency japanese yen debt fixed rate principal payments average interest rate interest rate risk japanese yen functional currency long term japanese yen debt fixed rate principal payments average interest rate us dollar functional currency long term us dollar debt fixed rate swapped to floating rate principal payments average interest rate long term us dollar debt fixed rate principal payments average interest rate the fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt instruments were issued by and are accounted for by one of our japanese subsidiaries 
accordingly  the monthly translation of these instruments  which varies due to changes in foreign exchange rates  is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income upon the consolidation of this subsidiary
