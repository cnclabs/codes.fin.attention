item a 
risk factors 
you should carefully consider the following risks together with all of the other information contained in this report in evaluating our company 
if any of these risks develop into actual events  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock could decline 
risks related to our business generally our business depends upon our ability to sponsor  and raise debt and equity capital for  our investment funds 
our business as a specialized asset manager depends upon our ability to sponsor investment funds  raise sufficient equity capital and debt financing for these funds and to generate management fees by managing these funds and the assets they hold 
if we are unable to raise capital or obtain financing through these funds  we will not be able to increase our assets under management and  accordingly  increase our revenues from management fees 
moreover  because many of our investment funds have limited terms  an inability to sponsor new investment funds could result in reduced assets under management and  accordingly  reduce our management fee revenues over time 
our ability to raise capital and obtain financing through these funds depends upon numerous factors  many of which are beyond our control  including existing capital markets conditions which may affect interest rates  the availability of acquisition financing as well as the amount and cost of such financing  and the returns we are able to achieve on our investments  asset valuation and pricing  and our ability to refinance or exit and realize value from investments made for the funds  market acceptance of the types of funds we sponsor and market perceptions about the types of assets which we seek to acquire for our funds  the willingness or ability of investors to invest in long term  relatively illiquid investments of the type we sponsor  the performance of our existing funds relative to market performance generally and to the performance of similar types of funds  the availability of qualified personnel to manage our funds  and the availability of suitable investments on acceptable terms of the type we seek to acquire for our funds 
under current market conditions  our ability to raise equity capital from both retail and institutional investors may not be at the same levels that we have achieved historically 
while we have sought to counteract this decline by sponsorship of rre opportunity reit and we have raised a total of million as of september   it is unlikely that rre opportunity reit will sell the maximum number of interests being offered 
declines in the market values of our investments may reduce our earnings and the availability of credit 
we classify a material portion of our assets for accounting purposes as available for sale 
as a result  changes in the market values of those assets are directly charged or credited to stockholders equity 
a decline in these values will reduce the book value of our assets 
moreover  if the decline in value of an available for sale asset is other than temporary  such decline will reduce earnings 
as a result of market conditions  the market value of many of our assets has declined and we have classified material amounts of these declines as other than temporary 
we cannot assure you that there will not be further declines in the value of our assets  or that the declines will not be material  or that they will not be other than temporary 

back to index 
back to index a decline in the market value of our assets may also adversely affect us in instances where we have borrowed money based on the market value of those assets or seek new borrowings 
if the market value of assets securing an existing loan declines  the lender may reduce availability if the loan is a line of credit  require us to post additional collateral or require us to pay down the loan so that it meets specified loan to collateral value ratios 
if we were unable to post the additional collateral  we could have to sell the assets under adverse market conditions which could result in losses and which could result in us failing our debt covenants 
moreover  a decline in asset values could limit our ability to obtain financing in the amounts we seek or require us to provide more collateral to secure proposed financing 
market changes  including changes in interest rates  may reduce the value of our assets  our returns on these assets and our ability to generate and increase our management fee revenues 
market changes  including changes in interest rates  will affect the market value of assets we hold for our own account and our returns from such assets 
in general  as interest rates rise  the value of fixed rate investments will decrease  while as interest rates fall  the return on variable rate assets will fall 
in addition  changes in interest rates may affect the value and return on assets we manage for our investment funds  thereby affecting both our management fees from those funds and  in particular  any performance based or incentive fees  see in some of our investment funds  a portion of our management fees may depend upon the performance of the fund and  as a result  our management fee income may be volatile as well as our ability to sponsor additional investment funds  which  in turn  may affect our ability to generate and increase our management fee revenues 
increases in interest rates will increase our operating costs 
as of september   we had two corporate credit facilities that were subject to variable interest rates 
we may seek to obtain other credit facilities depending upon capital markets conditions 
any facilities that we may be able to obtain may also be at variable rates 
as a result  increases in interest rates on such credit facilities  to the extent they are with recourse to us and are not matched by increased interest rates or other income from the assets whose acquisition was financed by these facilities  or are not subject to effective hedging arrangements  will increase our interest costs  which would reduce our net income or cause us to sustain losses 
for a discussion of the effects of interest rate changes on our interest expense relating to our corporate credit facilities  see part ii  item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in this filing 
changes in interest rates may impair the operating results of our investment funds and thereby impair our operating results 
the investments made by many of our funds are interest rate sensitive 
as a result  changes in interest rates could reduce the value of the assets held by those funds and the returns to investors  thereby impairing our ability to raise capital see our business depends upon our ability to sponsor  and raise debt and equity capital for  our investment funds  above  reducing the management and other fees from those funds and reducing our returns on  and the value of  amounts we have invested in those funds 
if we cannot generate sufficient cash to fund our participations in our investment funds  our ability to maintain and increase our revenues may be impaired 
we typically participate in our investment funds along with our investors  and believe that our participation enhances our ability to raise capital from investors 
we typically fund our participations through cash derived from operations or from financing 
if our cash from operations is insufficient to fund our participation in future investment funds we sponsor  we may seek to obtain funding from capital markets which may be unavailable to us  or cause us to incur significant costs  which would impede our ability to raise funds from investors and  thus  our ability to maintain and increase the revenues we receive from fund management 
termination of management arrangements with one or more of our investment funds could harm our business 
we provide management services to our investment funds through management agreements  through our position as the sole or managing general partner of partnership funds  through our position as the operating manager of other fund entities  or combinations thereof 
our arrangements are long term  and frequently have no specified termination dates 
however  our management arrangements with  or our position as general partner or operating manager of  an investment fund typically may be terminated by action taken by the investors 
upon any such termination  our management fees  after payment of any termination payments required  would cease  thereby reducing our expected future revenues 

back to index 
back to index we may have difficulty managing our asset portfolios under current market conditions 
current market conditions have increased the complexity of managing the assets held by us and our investment funds 
as a result  we depend on the ability of our officers and key employees to continue to implement and improve our operational  financial and management controls  reporting systems and procedures to deal effectively with the complexity of the conditions under which we operate 
we may not be able to implement improvements to our management information and control systems in an efficient or timely manner and may discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls 
consequently  we may experience strains on our administrative and operations infrastructure  increasing our costs or reducing or eliminating our profitability 
our allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover future losses 
at september   our allowance for possible credit losses was million on receivables from managed entities  primarily representing of the book value of the receivables from our commercial finance and real estate managed funds 
we cannot assure you that these allowances will prove to be sufficient to cover future losses  or that any future provisions for credit losses that we may record will not be materially greater than those we have recorded to date 
losses that exceed our allowance for credit losses  or cause an increase in our provision for credit losses  could materially reduce our earnings 
many of our assets are illiquid  and we may not be able to divest them in response to changing economic  financial and investment conditions 
in addition  significant portions of our assets are subject to transfer constraints 
many of our assets do not have ready markets  or there are restrictions on our ability to divest of our investment 
moreover  we believe that whatever markets currently exist for many of these assets  particularly real estate and cdo interests  they are more limited than they previously had been due to recessionary conditions from to and low growth conditions thereafter 
as a result  many of our portfolio assets are relatively illiquid investments 
we may be unable to vary our portfolio in response to changing economic  financial and investment conditions or to sell our investments on acceptable terms should we desire or need to do so 
we are subject to substantial competition in all aspects of our business 
our ability to sponsor investment funds depends upon our access to various distribution systems of national  regional and local securities firms  and our ability to locate and acquire appropriate assets for our investment funds 
we are subject to substantial competition in each area  and in some cases  competition has caused price increases  which has reduced the discount at which many properties sell  making them less attractive from an investment standpoint 
in the distribution area  our investment funds compete with those sponsored by other asset managers  which are being distributed through the same networks  as well as investments sponsored by the securities firms themselves  none of the distribution systems which we access has any obligation to sell any of the interests in our investment funds 
while we have been successful in maintaining access to these distribution systems  we cannot assure you that we will continue to do so 
if access to one or more of our distribution channels is limited or terminated  the number of funds we sponsor and assets we manage could be reduced  thereby impeding and possibly impairing our revenues and revenue growth 
in acquiring appropriate assets for our investment funds  we compete with numerous public and private investment entities  commercial banks  investment banks and other financial institutions  as well as industry participants  in each of our separate asset management areas 
many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
competition for desirable investments may result in higher costs and lower investment returns  and may delay our sponsorship of investment funds 
there are few economic barriers to entry in the asset management business 
our investment funds compete against an ever increasing number of investment and asset management products and services sponsored by investment banks  banks  insurance companies  financial services companies and others 
there are few economic barriers to entry into the investment or asset management industries and  as a result  we expect that competition for access to distribution channels and appropriate assets to acquire will increase 
our ability to realize our deferred tax asset may be reduced  which may adversely impact results of operations 
realization of a deferred tax asset requires us to exercise significant judgment and is inherently uncertain because it requires the prediction of future occurrences 
we may reduce our deferred tax asset in the future if estimates of projected income or our tax planning strategies do not support the amount of the deferred tax asset or due to unanticipated changes in future tax rates 
if we determine that a valuation allowance of our deferred tax asset is necessary  we may incur a charge to earnings 

back to index 
back to index the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act may be detrimental to our business 
we expect that the dodd frank act  which as of september  is still in the process of being implemented  will have a significant impact on the financial services industry  and may particularly impact us with respect to increased compliance costs  hedging activities  our broker dealer operations and  possibly  our ability to obtain financing to increase our assets under management or revenues 
because much of the dodd frank act creates a framework through which regulatory reform will be promulgated  rather than providing regulatory reform itself  we cannot predict the magnitude of the effect that the dodd frank act will ultimately have on us 
failure to maintain adequate infrastructure could impede our productivity and growth 
our infrastructure  including our technological capacity and office space  is important to our ability to conduct our operations 
failure to maintain an adequate infrastructure commensurate with the size and scope of our business could impede our productivity and growth  which could cause our earnings or stock price to decline 
furthermore  we are highly dependent on various software applications  technologies and other systems for our business to function properly and to safeguard confidential information  any significant limitation  failure or security breach of these systems could constrain our operations 
we utilize software and related technologies throughout our business to  among other things  obtain securities pricing information  process client transactions  and provide reports and other customer services to the clients of the funds we manage 
although we take protective measures  including measures to effectively secure information through system security technology and established and tested business continuity plans  we may experience system delays and interruptions as a result of natural disasters  power failures  acts of war and third party failures 
we cannot predict with certainty all of the adverse effects that could result from our failure  or the failure of a third party  to efficiently address and resolve these delays and interruptions 
these adverse effects could include the inability to perform critical business functions or failure to comply with financial reporting and other regulatory requirements  which could lead to loss of client confidence  harm to our reputation  exposure to disciplinary action and liability to our clients 
accordingly  potential system failures and the cost necessary to correct those failures could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and business prospects 
in addition  we could be subject to losses if we fail to properly safeguard sensitive and confidential information 
as part of our normal operations  we maintain and transmit confidential information about our clients as well as proprietary information relating to our business operations 
although we take protective measures  our systems could still be vulnerable to unauthorized access  computer viruses or other events that have a security impact  such as an authorized employee or vendor inadvertently or intentionally causing us to release confidential or proprietary information 
such disclosure could  among other things  allow competitors access to our proprietary business information and require significant time and expense to investigate and remediate the breach 
moreover  loss of confidential client information could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under laws that protect confidential personal data  resulting in increased costs or loss of revenues 
risks relating to particular aspects of our real estate  financial fund management and commercial finance operations as a result of current conditions in the global credit markets  our ability to sponsor investment entities in our financial fund management business and increase our assets under management may be limited 
our financial fund management business historically has consisted of the sponsorship and management of cdo issuers 
as a result of conditions in the global credit markets  sponsorship of new cdos was impracticable in fiscal and constrained significantly in fiscal moreover  our ability to sponsor investment funds in our real estate segment is significantly affected by our ability to obtain financing for the funds and the assets they acquire 
although in both fiscal and we were able to obtain financing necessary for us and our investment funds  we are aware that  in general  lending standards are tighter and credit availability is more constricted than in the past 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain new financing or refinance existing financing in the future on acceptable financial terms  or at all 
an inability to obtain financing could limit or eliminate our ability to sponsor investment entities and increase our assets under management and  accordingly  impair our ability to generate asset management fees 

back to index 
back to index we typically have retained some portion or all of the equity in the cdos or clos we sponsored 
cdo equity receives distributions from the cdo only if the cdo generates enough income to first pay the holders of the debt securities and the cdo s expenses 
we typically have retained some portion or all of the equity interest in cdos and clos we sponsored either directly or through limited partnership investments 
the equity is usually entitled to all of the income generated by the cdo after the cdo pays all of the interest due on the debt securities and its other expenses  and is entitled to a return on capital only when the principal amount and accrued interest of all of the debt securities has been paid 
however  there will be little or no income available to the cdo equity if covenants regarding the operations of a cdo primarily relating to the value of collateral and interest coverage are not met  or if there are excessive payment defaults  payment deferrals or rating agency downgrades with respect to the issuers of the underlying collateral  and there may be little or no amounts available to return our capital 
in that event  our revenues from and the value of our direct or indirect investment in the cdo s equity  which for all cdos was million at september   could decrease substantially or be eliminated 
in addition  the equity securities of cdos are generally illiquid and  because they represent a leveraged investment in the cdo s assets  the value of the equity securities will generally have greater fluctuations than the value of the underlying collateral 
in some of our investment funds  a portion of our management fees may depend upon the performance of the fund and  as a result  our management fee income may be volatile 
as of september   a portion of our management fees is subordinated to the investors receipt of specified returns in of the cdos we manage 
in addition  with respect to rso and nine of our investment entities  we receive incentive or subordinated compensation in addition to our base management fee  depending upon whether rso or those partnerships achieve returns above specified levels 
during fiscal and  we earned incentive and subordinated management fees from rso and from and cdos  respectively  which constituted and  respectively  of our aggregate management fee income for both periods 
continuing low growth or recessionary conditions in the national economy may result in the amount of incentive or subordinated management fee income we receive being reduced or possibly eliminated  and may cause these fees to be subject to high volatility 
our real estate investment funds hold loans in their portfolios that are subject to a higher risk of loss than conventional mortgage loans 
the real estate investment funds that we have sponsored and manage  which we refer to as our rre funds  and from which we derive management and other fees  hold loans and or direct investments in real estate 
in many instances  the loans in their portfolios have terms that differ significantly from conventional mortgage loans 
in particular  these loans may be junior mortgage loans  involve payment structures other than equal periodic payments that retire a loan over its term  require the borrower to pay a large lump sum at loan maturity which will depend upon the borrower s ability to obtain financing or otherwise raise a substantial amount of cash at maturity  and while producing income  do not generate sufficient revenues to pay the full amount of debt service on the loan as originally structured 
as a result  these real estate loans may have a higher risk of default and loss than conventional mortgage loans  and may require the rre funds to become involved in expensive and time consuming workouts  or bankruptcy  reorganization or foreclosure proceedings 
both the rre funds real estate held and the real estate securing their loans is typically the principal or sole source of recovery for these real estate loans  and thus the value and performance of the rre funds will depend upon local  regional and national economic conditions  and conditions affecting the property specifically  including the cost of compliance with  and liability under environmental  health and safety laws  changes in interest rates and the availability of financing  casualty losses  the attractiveness of the property  the availability of tenants  the ability of tenants to pay rent  competition from similar properties in the area and neighborhood values 
operating and other expenses of real properties  particularly significant expenses such as real estate taxes  insurance and maintenance costs  generally do not decrease when revenues decrease and  even if revenues increase  operating and other expenses may increase faster than revenues 

back to index 
back to index we will likely incur losses from our retention of the management of four equipment partnership funds 
in fiscal  we transferred substantially all of our commercial finance operations to leaf and  in november  as a result of the november leaf transaction  we deconsolidated leaf  while retaining a minority interest in it 
however  we retained the obligation to manage four equipment leasing partnerships funds 
in connection therewith  we have entered into a sub servicing agreement with leaf to service the leases held by these funds 
although we waived receipt of all future management fees  we are still obligated to pay sub servicing fees to leaf 
furthermore  we along with two of the commercial finance investment partnerships have provided a limited guarantee to the lender on debt outstanding on these respective investment partnerships reference is made to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  commitments and contingencies 
we may be unable to continue to attract  motivate and retain key personnel  and the cost to retain key personnel could put pressure on our operating margin 
our business depends on our ability to attract  motivate and retain highly skilled  and often highly specialized  technical  managerial and executive personnel  there is no assurance that we will be able to do so 
if our revenues continue to decline during fiscal  it will place significant added pressure on our ability to pay our employees at competitive levels 
our operating margin may decline if we increase compensation to retain key personnel without a commensurate increase in revenues 
failure to comply with the securities exchange act  investment advisers act and the investment company act and related regulations could result in substantial harm to our reputation and results of operations 
certain of our subsidiaries  including our broker dealer  are registered with the sec under the securities exchange act or the investment advisers act 
the investment advisers act and the securities exchange act impose numerous obligations and duties  respectively  on registered broker dealers and registered investment advisers  including record keeping  operating and marketing requirements  disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities  as well as additional detailed operational and compliance requirements 
the failure of any of the relevant subsidiaries to comply with the either such act could cause the sec to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations  including censure  fines or termination of registration  and could lead to harm to our reputation  any of which could cause our earnings or stock price to decline 
we have identified a material weakness in our internal control over the valuation of two of our legacy real estate investments that  if not remediated  could affect our ability to prepare timely and accurate financial reports  which could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock 
in connection with the preparation of this report  we identified and reported a material weakness in our internal controls over the valuation of two of our legacy real estate investments 
as a result of this material weakness  we were unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting relating to the value assigned to these assets was effective as of september  although we have instituted new controls to remediate this weakness  if these controls are not effective  our ability to prepare timely and accurate financial reports could be affected  which could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock or our ability to obtain financing for our operations

back to index item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a specialized asset management company that uses industry specific expertise to evaluate  originate  service and manage investment opportunities through our our real estate  financial fund management and commercial finance subsidiaries as well as our joint ventures 
as a specialized asset manager  we seek to develop investment funds for outside investors for which we provide asset management services  typically under long term management arrangements either through a contract with  or as the manager or general partner of  our sponsored investment funds 
we typically maintain an investment in the funds we sponsor 
as of september   we managed billion of assets 
we limit our fund development and management services to asset classes where we own existing operating companies or have specific expertise 
we believe this strategy enhances the return on investment we can achieve for our funds 
in our real estate operations  we concentrate on the ownership  operation and management of multifamily and commercial real estate and real estate mortgage loans including whole mortgage loans  first priority interests in commercial mortgage loans  known as a notes  subordinated interests in first mortgage loans  known as b notes  mezzanine loans  investments in discounted and distressed real estate loans and investments in value added properties properties which  although not distressed  need substantial improvements to reach their full investment potential 
in our financial fund management operations  we concentrate on bank loans  trust preferred securities of banks  bank holding companies  insurance companies and other financial companies  and asset backed securities  or abs 
in our real estate segment  we have focused our efforts primarily on acquiring and managing a diversified portfolio of commercial real estate and real estate related debt that has been significantly discounted due to the effects of current economic conditions and high levels of leverage 
we expect to continue to expand this business by raising investor funds through our retail broker channel for investment programs  principally through resource real estate opportunity reit  inc which we refer to as rre opportunity reit 
in april  we completed the sale of our common equity interests in apidos capital management  llc  or apidos  our former clo management subsidiary  to cvc capital partners sicav fis  sa  a private equity firm  or cvc 
in connection with the transaction  we received million in cash before transaction costs and partnership interests in a joint venture  cvc credit partners  lp  or cvc credit partners  that includes the apidos portfolio as well as the portfolio contributed by cvc 
additionally  we retained a preferred equity interest in apidos  which entitles us to receive of the incentive management fees from the legacy apidos portfolios that were previously managed by us and are now managed by cvc credit partners 
we recorded a million net gain on the sale 
in our financial fund management segment  our recent focus has primarily been the sponsorship and management of collateralized debt and loan obligations  or clos and cdos 
in october  on behalf of resource capital corp  or rso  and third party investors  we closed apidos clo viii million of par value 
through our new joint venture  we closed apidos clo ix million of par value in july and apidos clo x million of par value in november for fiscal  we expect to continue to focus on managing our existing assets as well as to continue to expand our clo business through our joint venture 
our commercial finance operations underwent significant restructuring and recapitalization during fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal these transactions provided substantial amounts of equity and debt financing to the lease origination and servicing platform  which is now held by leaf commercial capital  inc  or leaf 
our subsidiary  leaf financial corporation  retained the partnership management operations 
as a result of the recapitalization  our equity interest in leaf was reduced to on a fully diluted basis  and we have deconsolidated leaf from our financial statements as of november  we recorded an million gain on the deconsolidation of leaf  inclusive of a million remeasurement gain to reflect our investment in leaf at fair value during our first fiscal quarter ended december  due to the deconsolidation of leaf  we have decreased our total assets at september  by million and our outstanding borrowings by million from the corresponding balances reported at september  we currently account for our interests in leaf as an equity method investment 
from november  to march   the equity losses we recorded from leaf reduced our investment to zero as of march  in addition  we have recorded provisions for credit losses of million during fiscal on our receivables due from three of our commercial finance investment funds based on reductions in their projected cash flows 

back to index 
back to index during fiscal  we further improved our balance sheet and liquidity by refinancing our existing corporate debt 
in november  we redeemed million of our senior notes and modified the remaining million of notes to reduce the interest rate to from and to extend the maturity to october in conjunction with the modification of the notes  we accelerated the amortization of the warrant cost associated with the original issuance and  accordingly  recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of million during fiscal in october and november  we amended our corporate credit facilities with republic bank and td bank  respectively  to extend the maturities of those facilities to december as of november   we have million of availability under these two facilities 
we recorded consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders of million for fiscal this was primarily the result of recording a net gain net of tax of million from the sale of apidos  offset  in part  by an million net of tax of million provision for credit losses on our receivables from the commercial finance funds 
assets under management we increased our assets under management by billion to billion at september  from billion at september  the following table sets forth information relating to our assets under management by operating segment in millions  except percentages september  increase decrease amount percentage financial fund management real estate commercial finance for information on how we calculate assets under management  see the first table and related notes in item  business assets under management

base management fees varied by clo issuer ranged between and of the aggregate principal balance of eligible collateral held by the clo issuers 
subordinate management fees  which also varied by clo issuer ranged between and of the aggregate principal balance of eligible collateral held by the clo issuers  were subordinated to debt service payments on the clos

rso also contributed assets and cash to leaf  and guggenheim securities llc  or guggenheim  provided a credit facility for use in leaf s originations 
leaf financial retained the management of four equipment leasing partnerships  for which leaf will be the sub servicer 
because we controlled leaf  its results are included in our financial statements for fiscal and we discuss those results in this section 
however  as a result of the november leaf transaction  we determined that we no longer control leaf and  accordingly  it was deconsolidated from our financial statements during fiscal  with our retained interest being accounted for on the equity method of accounting 
the commercial finance assets we manage through leaf  our unconsolidated joint venture  decreased by million to million as compared to million at september  this decrease reflects a million reduction in assets we managed for our four investment entities due to the natural runoff of the lease portfolios  which was partially offset by a million increase in the leaf portfolio

however  we will continue to record our share of any charges that may be recorded in leaf s accumulated other comprehensive income relating to its hedging activities 
commencing december   we agreed to waive all future management fees from our commercial finance investment partnerships due to their reduced equity distributions as a result of the impact of the recession on their respective cash flows 
accordingly  we waived million and million of fund management fees from these entities during fiscal and  respectively 
revenues fiscal compared to fiscal revenues decreased million to million for fiscal as compared million for fiscal we attribute these decreases primarily to the following a million decrease in management fees 
in fiscal  we began waiving certain management fees from our commercial finance investment partnerships due to their reduced equity distributions as a result of the impact of the recession on their respective cash flows 
in fiscal  we waived million of these fees as compared to million in fiscal  and a million decrease in asset acquisition fees 
the difficulty in obtaining and maintaining debt financing by the investment funds we manage coupled with certain of those funds entering maturity phases has limited their ability to acquire equipment financings from us 
consequently  we reduced our commercial finance originations to match their asset acquisition capabilities 
these decreases were partially offset by the following an million increase in finance revenues due to the million increase in the portfolio of assets held for our own account  reflecting the contribution of the rso portfolio to leaf in january in addition to our ongoing lease and loan originations  a million decrease in equity losses on unconsolidated partnerships  reflecting a decrease in the provision for credit losses by our investment partnerships and a non recurring gain on the extinguishment of debt  and a  increase in other income  primarily due to an increase in the insurance fees we generated

in fiscal and  we originated and sold the leases and notes to our investment partnerships 
accordingly  we netted the idc capitalization of million and million  respectively  against the corresponding acquisition fees we recorded from the partnerships at the time of sale to the investment partnerships 
in fiscal  we have maintained the commercial assets we acquired on our balance sheet and  therefore  have reflected the capitalization of idc costs separately as a reduction of our general and administrative expenses 
these decreases were partially offset by the following a million increase in wage and benefit costs  primarily driven by a reduction in the amount of costs and that we could allocate to our managed investment partnerships

restructuring expenses we recorded a  charge for restructuring during fiscal consisting of severance and benefits for terminated employees 
the decrease in staffing levels reflects our decreased overhead requirements as a result of the sale of apidos and the recapitalization of leaf 
gain loss on the sale of leases and loans during fiscal  we recorded a gain on the sale of leases and loans of  prior to the deconsolidation of leaf  as compared to gains of  for fiscal and a loss of million for fiscal during fiscal  availability on the warehouse facility for our commercial finance operations declined and the facility was terminated in may due to the lack of other available financing during fiscal  loans and leases were sold to third parties  as well as to rso  at a loss

this increase was offset  in part  by the million reduction in the provision for commercial finance leases and loans held for investment due to the deconsolidation of leaf in november depreciation and amortization fiscal compared to fiscal due to the november deconsolidation of leaf  depreciation expense decreased by million for fiscal as compared to fiscal the following table reflects the depreciation reported by leaf as compared to our other operating segments in thousands years ended september  leaf other operating segments total depreciation expense other operating segment depreciation is comprised of million of depreciation on our real estate investment consolidated property investments for fiscal and  respectively  and million and  depreciation on property and equipment for fiscal and  respectively

income taxes fiscal compared to fiscal our effective income tax rate income taxes as a percentage of income from continuing operations  before taxes was a provision of for fiscal as compared to a benefit of for fiscal the change in the income tax rate primarily relates to the lesser impact of permanent items relative to the pre tax income for fiscal our effective income tax rate without discrete tax items would have been for fiscal we project our effective tax rate to be between and for fiscal this rate can vary from period to period depending on  among other factors  the geographic and business mix of our earnings and the level of our tax credits

our effective income tax rate  as adjusted to exclude adjustments primarily related to discrete items  would have been for fiscal discontinued operations in connection with the sale of a real estate loan in march  we agreed that in exchange for the property owner relinquishing certain control rights  we would make payments to the owner under stipulated circumstances 
on april   we were formally notified that a trigger event had occurred on march  and  accordingly  we accrued the present value of the payout due under the agreement in the amount of million  which was reflected in fiscal as a million loss  net of tax  from discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations 
discontinued operations in fiscal represent the accretion of the liability 
income from discontinued operations for fiscal primarily reflect the reversal of  of interest and penalty assessments related to prior year irs tax examinations  which related to the disallowance of bad debt deductions taken on properties held by our real estate operations that were subsequently disposed of and the deductions were realized

limited loan guarantee 
we and two of our commercial finance fund partnerships  lease equity appreciation fund i  lp  or leaf i  and lease equity appreciation fund ii  lp  or leaf ii  have provided a limited guarantee to a lender to the partnerships in exchange for a waiver of any existing defaulted loan covenants and certain future financial covenants 
the loans mature at the earlier of a the maturity date march  for the leaf i loan and december  for the leaf ii loan  or b the date on which an event of default under the loan agreement occurs 
the maximum guarantee provided by us is up to million million for leaf i and million for leaf ii

under certain circumstances  the lender will also discount their loans by approximately  for leaf i and  for leaf ii 
management has determined that based on projected cash flows from the underlying lease and loan portfolios collateralizing the loans  there should be sufficient funds to repay the leaf partnerships outstanding loan balances and  accordingly  we have not recorded any future liability under this guarantee

two financial fund management investment entities that have incentive distributions  also known as carried interests  are structured so that there is a clawback of previously paid incentive distributions to the extent that such distributions exceed the cumulative net profits of the entities  as defined in the respective partnership agreements 
on november  and january   we  along with the co manager of the general partner of those investment entities  repurchased substantially all the remaining limited partnership interests in these two partnerships  significantly reducing our potential clawback liability 
the clawback liability we recorded was million at september  and legal proceedings 
see item  legal proceedings 
real estate commitments 
as a specialized asset manager  we sponsor investment funds in which we may make an equity investment along with outside investors 
this equity investment is generally based on a percentage of funds raised and varies among investment programs 
with respect to rre opportunity reit  we have committed to invest of the equity raised to a maximum amount of million 
this commitment has been reduced to million as of september  for funds already invested to date 
in july  we entered into an agreement with one of the tenant in common programs we sponsored and manage 
this agreement requires us to fund up to million  principally for capital improvements  for the underlying property over the next two years 
we had advanced funds totaling million as of september  the liabilities for the real estate commitments will be recorded in the future as the amounts become due and payable 
general corporate commitments 
we are also a party to employment agreements with certain executives that provide for compensation and other benefits  including severance payments under specified circumstances 
as of september   except for the clawback liability recorded for the two trapeza entities  real estate commitments  and executive compensation  we do not believe it is probable that any payments will be required under any of our commitments and contingencies  and accordingly  no liabilities for these obligations have been recorded in the consolidated financial statements 

back to index 
back to index variable interest entities in general  vies are entities in which equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
we have variable interests in vies through our management contracts and investments in various securitization entities  including cdo issuers 
since we serve as the asset manager for the investment entities we sponsored and manage  we are generally deemed to have the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance 
in the case of an interest in a vie we manage  we will perform an additional qualitative analysis to determine if our interest including any investment as well as any management fees that qualify as variable interests could absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the vie 
this analysis considers the most optimistic and pessimistic scenarios of potential economic results that could reasonably be experienced by the vie 
we then compare the benefits we would receive in the optimistic scenario or the losses we would absorb in the pessimistic scenario as compared to all benefits and losses absorbed by the vie in total 
if the benefits or losses we would absorb were significant as compared to total benefits and losses absorbed by all variable interest holders  then we would conclude we are the primary beneficiary 
our investments in rso  rre opportunity reit  and our investments in the structured finance entities that hold investments in trust preferred assets  which we refer to as our trapeza entities  and asset backed securities  which we refer to as our ischus entities  were all determined to be vies that we do not consolidate as we do not have the obligation of  or right to  losses or earnings that would be significant to those entities 
with respect to rre opportunity reit  we have advanced offering costs that are being reimbursed as the reit raises additional equity 
except for those advances  we have not provided financial or other support to these vies and have no liabilities  contingent liabilities  or guarantees implicit or explicit related to these vies at september  critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we make estimates of our allowance for credit losses  the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  discounts and collectability of management fees  the valuation of stock based compensation  and in determining whether a decrease in the fair value of an investment is an other than temporary impairment 
the financial fund management segment makes assumptions in determining the fair value of our investments in securities and in estimating the liability  if any  for clawback provisions on certain of our partnership interests 
we used assumptions  specifically inputs to the black scholes pricing model and the discounted cash flow model  in computing the fair value of the senior notes and related warrants 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the following policies as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
stock based compensation we value the restricted stock we issue based on the closing price of our stock on the date of grant 
for stock option awards  we determine the fair value by applying the black scholes pricing model 
these equity awards are amortized to compensation expense over the respective vesting periods  less an estimate for forfeitures 
receivables from managed entities we perform a review of the collectability of our receivables from managed entities on a quarterly basis 
if upon review there is an indication of impairment  we will analyze the expected future cash flows of the managed entity 
with respect to receivables from our commercial finance investment partnerships  the analysis takes into consideration several assumptions by management  primarily concerning estimates of future bad debts and recoveries 
for receivables from the real estate investment entities for which there are indications of impairment  we estimate the cash flows through the sale of the underlying properties  which is based on projected net operating income as a multiple of published capitalization rates  which is then reduced by the underlying mortgage balances and priority distributions due to the investors in the entity 
we will record an allowance against the related receivable from managed entities to the extent that the estimated cash flows are insufficient to fully recover our receivable balance 

back to index 
back to index investment securities our investment securities available for sale  including investments in the clo issuers we sponsored  are carried at fair value 
the fair value of the clo investments is based primarily on internally generated expected cash flow models that require significant management judgment and estimates due to the lack of market activity and the use of unobservable pricing inputs 
investments in affiliated entities  including holdings in tbbk and rso  are valued at the closing price of the respective publicly traded stock 
the fair value of the cumulative net unrealized gains and losses on these investment securities  net of tax  is reported through accumulated other comprehensive income and loss 
realized gains and losses on the sale of investments are determined on the trade date on the basis of specific identification and are included in net operating results 
we recognize a realized loss when it is probable there has been an adverse change in estimated cash flows from those previously estimated 
the security is then written down to fair value  and the unrealized loss is transferred from accumulated other comprehensive loss to the consolidated statements of operations as a charge to current earnings 
the cost basis adjustment for an other than temporary impairment would be recoverable only upon the sale or maturity of the security 
periodically  we review the carrying value of our available for sale securities 
if we deem an unrealized loss to be other than temporary  we will record an impairment charge 
our process for identifying an other than temporary decline in the fair value of our investments involves consideration of i the duration of a significant decline in value  ii the liquidity  business prospects and overall financial condition of the issuer  iii the magnitude of the decline  iv the collateral structure and other credit support  as applicable  and v the more than likely intention to hold the investment until the value recovers 
additionally  with respect to our evaluation of our investment in rso  we also take into consideration our role as the external manager and the value of its management contract  which includes a substantial termination fee 
when the analysis of the above factors results in a conclusion that a decline in fair value is other than temporary  we record an impairment charge and the cost of our investment is written down to fair value 
we purchased investment securities classified as trading during fiscal trading securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses included in earnings and reported in revenue 
we utilize trade date accounting to record the purchases and sales of trading securities 
the cost of a security is determined using the specific identification method 
earnings from trading securities  primarily are reported net  and are comprised of realized and unrealized gains and losses from sales of trading securities  mark to market adjustments to fair value  gains and losses related to foreign currency commissions from riskless principal trades  as well as any gains and losses from other security transactions 
to determine fair value  we use third party dealer quotes or bids and recent transactions 
in fiscal  we held shares of tbbk common stock in a benefit plan for a former executive 
the shares  classified as trading  were valued at the closing price of the stock and unrealized gains and losses were included in other income 
we recognize dividend income on our investment securities classified as available for sale on the ex dividend date 
investments in unconsolidated loan manager our interest in cvc credit partners and our preferred equity interest in apidos cvc is included in investments in unconsolidated loan manager on the consolidated balance sheets 
we account for our investment in cvc credit partners based on the equity method since we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the partnership 
we account for our preferred equity interest in apidos cvc on the cost method 
as the incentive fees underlying the preferred equity are received  will be distributed to us which will initially be credited to income net of any contractual amounts due to third parties 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate the investment for impairment by estimating the fair value of the expected future discounted cash flows from the incentive management fees 
if the estimated fair value is less than the cost basis of the preferred shares  the preferred equity interest will be deemed to be impaired 
then  if we determine that the shortfall is other than temporary  the impairment will be recorded as a reduction of the preferred equity interest by reducing the revenues previously recorded on the preferred shares 
to the extent the investment in preferred equity has been reduced to zero  all subsequent cash receipts will be recorded as income as received 
accounting for income taxes the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and to recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the our consolidated financial statements or tax returns 

back to index 
back to index we adjust the balance of our deferred taxes to reflect the tax rates at which future taxable amounts will likely be settled or realized 
the effects of tax rate changes on deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets  as well as other changes in income tax laws  are recognized in net earnings in the period during which such changes are enacted 
valuation allowances are established and adjusted  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
we assess our ability to realize deferred tax assets primarily based on tax planning strategies 
a tax position should only be recognized if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authority 
a tax position that meets this threshold is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we classify any tax penalties as general and administrative expenses and any interest as interest expense 
we do not have any unrecognized tax benefits that would affect the effective tax rate 
recent accounting standards accounting standard issued but not yet effective the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  has issued the following accounting standard  which was not yet effective for us as of september  comprehensive income loss 
in june  the fasb issued an amendment to eliminate the option to present components of other comprehensive income loss as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
the amendment requires that all non owner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income loss or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in the two statement approach  the first statement should present total net income loss and its components followed consecutively by a second statement that should present total other comprehensive income loss  the components of other comprehensive income loss  and the total of comprehensive income loss 
we plan to provide the disclosures as required by this amendment beginning october  newly adopted accounting principle fair value measurements 
in may  the fasb issued an amendment to revise the wording used to describe the requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
for many of the requirements  the fasb does not intend for the amendments to result in a change in the application of the current requirements 
some of the amendments clarify the fasb s intent about the application of existing fair value measurement requirements  such as specifying that the concepts of highest and best use and valuation premise in a fair value measurement are relevant only when measuring the fair value of nonfinancial assets 
other amendments change a particular principle or requirement for measuring fair value or for disclosing information about fair value measurements such as specifying that  in the absence of a level input  a reporting entity should apply premiums or discounts when market participants would do so when pricing the asset or liability 
this guidance became effective for us beginning january  and  accordingly  we have presented the required disclosures

weighted average borrowings on these facilities were million for fiscal at an effective interest rate of on outstanding borrowings
