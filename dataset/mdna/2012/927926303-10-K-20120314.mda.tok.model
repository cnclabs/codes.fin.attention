item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements for the three years ended december   and the related notes thereto  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states us gaap 
we have  from our inception until december   reported to securities regulators in both canada and the us using canadian generally accepted accounting principles financial statements with reconciliation to us gaap 
however  a change in the position of the united states securities and exchange commission sec in late required canadian companies  such as vista  that do not qualify as foreign private issuers to file their financial statements in the us using us gaap for periods beginning after december  therefore  we have retrospectively adopted us gaap effective january  for all us and canadian filings 
canadian securities regulators announced that they will continue to accept financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth under the section heading item a 
risk factors above and elsewhere in this annual report on form k

overview we are engaged in the evaluation  acquisition  exploration and advancement of gold exploration and potential development projects  which may lead to gold production  as well as the realization of market value of our assets 
historically  our approach to acquisitions of gold projects has generally been to seek projects within political jurisdictions with well established mining  land ownership and tax laws  which have adequate drilling and geological data to support the completion of a third party review of the geological data and to complete an estimate of gold mineralization 
in addition  we look for opportunities to improve the value of our gold projects continuing through exploration drilling and or re engineering the operating assumptions underlying previous engineering work 
we are continuing to move our more advanced projects through technical  engineering and feasibility studies so that production decisions can be made on those projects 
our holdings include the mt 
todd gold project in australia  the guadalupe de los reyes gold silver project in mexico  the concordia gold project in mexico  the long valley gold project in california  the awak mas gold project in indonesia  and mining claims in utah 
in addition  we also own approximately of the shares of midas gold corp  a company exploring for gold and developing the golden meadows project in the yellow pine stibnite district in idaho 
outlook at the end of  we owned or controlled five properties containing mineralized material 
we continue to advance our mt 
todd  guadalupe de los reyes and concordia whether ourselves or through invecture group  sa de sa invecture as part of invecture s exercise of the earn in right agreement  as discussed in project updates below projects through exploration  permitting and technical  engineering and feasibility studies so that production decisions can be made on those projects 
in addition  we believe that additional value can be added to the remaining projects through exploration drilling and engineering studies  thus advancing them closer to a production decision 
we do not currently generate operating cash flows 
subject to sustained gold prices and the risk factors disclosed under the section heading item a 
risk factors above  we hope to generate revenues and cash flows in the future 
we may generate revenues and cash flows from our portfolio of gold projects by several means  including  but not limited to  options  earn in right agreements or leases to third parties  joint venture arrangements with other gold producers  outright sales for cash and or royalties or project development and operation 
as at december   we had working capital of  and cash and cash equivalents of  at present  we believe that the current cash and cash equivalents balances as of december  of  and marketable securities of will cover these activities as well as general and administrative expenses 
additional capital will be necessary to advance the projects to positive production decisions  and to conduct additional exploration drilling and engineering studies on our properties 
additional capital may be raised via revenues  if earned  or equity and or debt financings 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to raise additional capital 
results from operations summary our consolidated net income was  or per basic share compared to our consolidated net loss of  or per basic share for the same period in for the year ended december   the increase in consolidated net income of  from the respective prior period was primarily the result of the unrealized gain on the long term investment of  and the gain on disposal of a mineral property of  which were offset by increases in exploration  property evaluation and holding costs of  corporate administration and investor relations costs of  and a deferred tax expense of  the increases in the unrealized gain on our shares of midas gold corp 
and the gain on disposal of mineral property were the result of the completion of the combination with midas gold corp 
on april  the increases in exploration  property evaluation and holding costs  corporate administration and investor relations costs  and deferred tax expense are explained below 
our consolidated net loss was  or per basic share compared to our consolidated net loss of  or per basic share for a net increase of  the increase of  in was largely due to a decrease in the gain on disposal of marketable securities of  the gain during was mostly the result of the sale of our allied nevada gold corp 
allied shares that we retained in connection with the transaction that resulted in the formation of allied and the transfer of vista s nevada properties to allied 
also contributing to the increase in net loss for was an increase in the loss on extinguishment of convertible debt of  on may   we entered into a note repurchase agreement whereby we repurchased  of outstanding principal notes in exchange for cash and common shares  and on july   we entered into a note repurchase agreement whereby we repurchased  of outstanding principal notes in exchange for cash of see item consolidated financial statements note 
lastly  contributing to the increase in net loss for was the increase in exploration  property evaluation and holding costs of  which is explained below 
exploration  property evaluation and holding costs exploration  property evaluation and holding costs were  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  the increases of  and  from the respective prior periods were primarily due to the following increases in expenses at our mt 
todd gold project of approximately  from to and approximately  from to the increase in was the result of expenses associated with the feasibility study that we are currently undertaking at our mt 
todd gold project  as well as an increase in expenses associated with permitting activities as we move the project towards a development decision 
the increase in was primarily a result of costs associated with the drilling program that began during expenses at our concordia gold project during approximated those for expenses increased from to as we focused on moving the project towards a development decision 
corporate administration and investor relations corporate administration and investor relations costs increased to  during the year ended december  as compared to  for the same period in the increase of  from the prior period was primarily due to increases in stock based compensation expense 
the increase in stock based compensation expense was primarily the result of our issuance of  stock options and  restricted stock units during the period as compared to the issuance of  stock options and  restricted stock units during the period 
the increase in employee benefits was primarily due to higher bonus payments during as compared to there were no other significant variances from the prior periods compared to the year ended december  corporate administration and investor relations costs decreased to  during the year ended december  compared to  in this decrease of from the prior period was primarily due to a decrease in stock based compensation expense 
the decrease in stock based compensation expense was primarily the result of our issuance of  stock options and  restricted stock units during the period as compared to the issuance of  stock options during the period 
the restricted stock units granted in vest over a period of one year and the intrinsic value is expensed equally over the vesting period as compared to stock options that have a vesting period of years  of which vest immediately and  accordingly  of the value is expensed immediately upon issuance and the remaining is expensed over the vesting period 
the result of such a vesting period is a much greater expense up front upon issuance of stock options 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense was  and for years ended december   and  respectively 
the increases of and from the respective prior periods were primarily attributable to increased capital expenditures at the mt 
todd gold project 
gain loss on extinguishment of convertible debt on may   we entered into a notes repurchase agreement with whitebox advisors llc whitebox whereby we agreed to repurchase their remaining senior secured convertible notes the notes 
pursuant to the repurchase agreement  we agreed to repurchase notes in the principal amount of  and interest payable through maturity on the notes of we agreed to pay whitebox  in cash and to issue  in common shares to whitebox as consideration for the principal amount of the notes and interest payable of  in aggregate 
the common shares issued were based on a share price of 
a loss of  was recorded in our consolidated statement of income loss as a result of the notes repurchase 
on july   we entered into note repurchase agreements the whitebox repurchase agreements with whitebox combined partners  lp whitebox combined partners  whitebox convertible arbitrage partners  lp whitebox convertible arbitrage and whitebox special opportunities fund series b partners  lp whitebox special opportunities whereby we agreed to repurchase their respective notes 
pursuant to the whitebox repurchase agreements  we agreed to repurchase notes i in the principal amount of from whitebox combined partners for an aggregate purchase price  including interest  of  ii in the principal amount of from whitebox convertible arbitrage for an aggregate purchase price  including interest  of  and iii in the principal amount of from whitebox special opportunities for an aggregate purchase price  including interest  of  based on a settlement date of july  we allocated the consideration paid on the repurchase of the notes to the liability and equity elements of the security based on their relative fair values at the date of the transaction 
a gain of was recorded in our consolidated statement of income loss as a result of the notes repurchase 
gain on disposal of mineral property on april   vista completed a combination the combination with midas gold  inc as part of the combination  each of midas gold inc and vista gold us inc 
contributed their respective interests in gold assets in the yellow pine stibnite district in idaho to a new canadian private company named midas gold corp 
midas gold 
in exchange for the contribution of our yellow pine assets  vista us was issued  common shares in the capital of midas gold midas gold shares 
upon initial recognition of its investment in the midas gold shares  vista elected to apply the fair value option  and as such  the investment is recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet 
the difference between the fair value of the  midas gold shares and the carrying value of our yellow pine assets has been recorded as a gain on disposal of mineral property of  given that vista ceased to have a controlling financial interest in the yellow pine gold project upon completion of the combination 
summarized financial information for midas gold as presented in this annual report on form k is as of september  and for the twelve months then ended  which represents midas gold s latest available financial data as of the filing date of this annual report 
the company will file an amendment to this annual report once the annual financial information for midas gold is available 
non operating income and expenses gain on sale of marketable securities for the year ended december   we realized a gain of on the sale of marketable securities as compared to for the same period in and  for the same period in the gain for resulted from the sale of marketable securities that had a book value of the gain for the same period in resulted from the sale of marketable securities that had a book value of the gain of  in was mostly the result of our sale on april  of all  common shares of allied for  these shares had a book value of  at december   we held marketable securities available for sale with a quoted market value of we purchased the securities for investing purposes with the intent to hold the securities until such time as it would be advantageous to sell the securities at a gain 
although there can be no reasonable assurance that a gain will be realized from the sale of the securities  we monitor the market status of the securities continuously in order to mitigate the risk of loss on the investment 
unrealized gain on long term investment unrealized gain on long term investment was  for as compared with no gain or loss for or upon initial recognition of our investment in the midas gold shares on april   we elected to apply the fair value option  and as such  the investment is recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet with subsequent changes in fair value being recorded in the consolidated statement of income loss in the period in which they occur 
write down of marketable securities write down of marketable securities was  nil and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we continuously evaluate the market value of our available for sale securities for other than temporary declines in market value 
such determination results in a write down of those impaired securities to the current fair value in the period in which such determinations are made 
interest income interest income decreased to for as compared to for the decrease of from the prior period was mostly the result of lower interest rates in the market 
interest income was during the year ended december  compared with in the slight increase of for the period was mostly the result of increased cash sent to australia to fund our mt 
todd gold project programs  and as a result  we were able to take advantage of higher interest rates in the australian market 
interest expense interest expense was during as compared with  for the same period in the decrease of from the prior period was attributable to the repurchase in may of a portion of our then outstanding notes and the repayment of the remaining notes on march  for the period  we were accruing interest on the principal amount of the  outstanding on the notes  whereas for the period  we were accruing interest on the principal amount of the  outstanding on the notes as a result of the extinguishment of the principal amount of  of the notes in may for the year ended december   is attributable to the amortization of the notes issuance costs and is attributable to interest expense 
these amounts are approximately of the full interest expense associated with the issuance of the notes 
interest expense was  during the year ended december  compared with  in the decrease of from the prior period was mostly due to the repurchase of  of the notes in may as compared to the repurchase of  of the notes in july deferred income tax expense as of december  and  our deferred tax assets were fully reserved with a related valuation allowance 
on april   we completed the combination with midas gold that was a tax free reorganization for us tax purposes 
however  upon completion of the combination  vista us received midas gold shares with a fair value that was determined to be  the corresponding estimated deferred tax expense of  at the time of the combination exceeded the valuation allowance of  for vista us 
therefore  the valuation allowance against vista us s deferred tax asset was released upon receipt of the midas gold shares 
at december   the deferred tax expense of  contemplates the deferred tax expense for our unrealized gain on the midas gold shares 
the tax calculation is based on an effective rate of us federal and state 
financial position  liquidity and capital resources operating activities net cash used in operating activities was  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the same period in the increase of  is mostly the result of increases in net income of  and the deferred tax expense of  which were offset by increases in the gain on the disposal of mineral property of  and the unrealized gain on the long term investment of  net cash used in operating activities in was  compared with  in the increase of  in was mostly the result of an increase in the net loss of  for the period  which was offset by a decrease in gain on disposal of marketable securities of  investing activities net cash used in investing activities was  for the year ended december  as compared to net cash used of  for the same period in the increase in cash used in investing activities of  is primarily due to increases in cash used to acquire long term investments of  which is due to the purchase of  midas gold shares by vista at c per share as part of midas gold s private placement in april this increase and other less significant increases were partially offset by cash proceeds received from awak mas holdings pty 
under the additional option agreement of  and a decrease in additions to mineral properties 
net cash used in investing activities in was  compared with net cash provided by investing activities of  in the increase of  in cash used by investing activities in was mostly the result of a decrease in the proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of  due to the sale of  common shares of allied that we held for  in addition  during  we sold most of the remaining patented mining claims in colorado for there were no similar transactions during the period 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was  for the year ended december   which included the following cash proceeds of  received from our april equity financing  proceeds of and received from the exercises of stock options and warrants  respectively  cash paid in lieu of capital stock issuances of  and repayment of the outstanding principal amount of  on the notes upon maturity on march  net cash provided by financing activities was  for the year ended december   which included the following cash proceeds of  received from our october equity financing  notes repayment of  and proceeds of received from the exercises of stock options

the pfs evaluates the viability of a  tonne per day processing facility and the optimized extraction of the identified mineral resource 
the previous pfs was constrained to treating mineralized material  the volume of which would be accommodated in the existing tailings disposal facility  tonnes  and the operating rate was  tonnes per day of ore compared to the higher  and more economical rate of  tonnes per day considered in the new pfs 
a new tailings disposal facility would be constructed to accommodate the excess tails from the increased ore reserves 
highlights of the pfs includes increased proven and probable mineral reserves  higher annual gold production  longer project life and improved economics at current and long term estimated gold prices 
the pfs was evaluated using a gold price of  per ounce 
therefore  the qualified persons believe the reserve estimate is the same under both sec industry guide and cim definition standards

see the section heading cautionary note to united states investors regarding estimates of measured  indicated and inferred resources and proven and probable reserves above 
by utilizing the remaining capacity in the project s existing tailings storage facility and deferring the capital for additional tailings storage capacity until later in the project s life  we have been able to increase the size of the proposed process facility to a more economic level of  tonnes per day and increase the projected annual production to  ounces per year over the first five years of the project 
based on these positive results  we have commenced a feasibility study for the mt 
todd gold project that we expect to complete by the end of the first quarter of or shortly thereafter

again  no mineral reserves were estimated in this study 
cautionary note to us investors see the section heading cautionary note to united states investors regarding estimates of measured  indicated and inferred resources and proven and probable reserves above 
we also announced on september   that we were preparing a definitive feasibility study  based on the new resource estimate  which we expect will include an updated estimate of mineral reserves 
during  we conducted drilling at the batman deposit for metallurgical testing and for geotechnical purposes and the results of this work will be incorporated in the definitive feasibility study 
exploration potential we control a large land package  hectares of exploration tenements primarily surrounding mining tenements that host the mt 
todd gold project 
el  obtained in may  is located west of the main block of tenements and is considered an area prospective for limestone for us in ore processing and the water treatment facility at mt 
todd 
in the third quarter of  during a review of pegasus airborne geophysical survey data  our geologists identified five magnetic targets on our exploration tenements 
the targets are referred to as the mt 
todd structural target sequence msts  and are characterized by distinct magnetic highs located within sedimentary rocks that should have a low magnetic signature 
these features are remarkably similar to those at mt 
todd  which  as a result of the included pyrrhotite  exhibits a strong magnetic high 
the msts targets were prioritized following review of historic work in the area and site visits 
as we announced on june   four of the new exploration targets are being investigated through additional soil and rock chip sampling and testing  followed  where appropriate  by drilling 
initial soil sampling on meter by meter grids was completed on msts and msts late in before the onset of the wet season 
in this part of australia  mining occurs on a year round basis as appropriate road access is installed  but exploration is difficult to impossible during the wet season november through april due to unimproved road conditions in the field 
both targets returned low level anomalous gold values 
msts shows a magnetic high within low signature silts and greywackes  however  there are no historic soil or rock chip sampling results on msts and no evidence of any mining 
golden eye at msts now called golden eye because of its appearance resembling two eyes on a surface sample assay map rock chip sampling  in an area with limited exposure  returned a grams gold per tonne sample from a small outcrop of fault breccia 
further sampling returned grams gold per tonne and grams gold per tonne assays in vein and breccias located meters and meters  respectively  north of the original sample 
due to the sparse outcrop  the orientation and thickness of the mineralized zone is not currently known 
a soil sampling program over the area was completed on a meter grid 
the survey returned a strong coherent gold anomaly approximately meters in diameter with coincident anomalous base metals and arsenic 
sampling was done by our employees and consultants under the direction of our vice president of exploration  frank fenne pg  who is a qualified person under ni  and shipped to nal for sample preparation and assaying 
sampling  sample custody  preparation and assaying were completed in compliance with ni standards 
beginning in august  after receiving approvals for drilling and before the onset of the wet season  we completed four core holes on msts now known as golden eye because of its appearance resembling two eyes on a surface sample assay map  out of six that were planned 
all four golden eye drill holes encountered strong sulfide mineralization associated with banded iron formation with interesting concentrations of copper  lead zinc and anomalous gold mineralization  with the best intercept occurring in hole ge and consisting of meters of grams gold per tonne including meters of grams gold per tonne 
drill results were encouraging and provided useful geologic information for next season s exploration program 
drilling was done by grid drilling of townsville  north queensland 
the core was logged  photographed and sampled by our employees and consultants under the direction of our vice president of exploration  mr 
frank fenne pg  who is a qualified person under ni the core was sawed in half by our employees and consultants and one half shipped to nal for sample preparation and assaying 
check assaying was done by genalysis of perth  australia 
core logging and sample custody  sample preparation and assaying were completed in compliance with ni standards 
five holes totalling  meters were completed during the field season 
drilling has intersected several narrow weakly mineralized zones  however  none that can yet be correlated with any confidence between different holes or between the drill holes and the mineralization identified on the surface 
nevertheless  the drilling has identified some additional features and structural complexity  which had not been revealed by the first stage of mapping and drilling carried out during the season 
the most encouraging mineralisation was intersected by ge  consisting of a sheared  chloritic and broken sulfide rich unit at meters  which assayed gold grams per tonne and a siliceous lode at meters which assayed gold grams per tonne 
although thin and patchy  this mineralisation is at least a clear indication that there are mineralised structures at golden eye  which are yet to be defined with confidence 
detailed structural measurements on all of the holes have revealed several fold closures and also some textures  which appear to be mylonite fabrics 
this data will be compiled and stereoplotted in order to try to gain a better understanding of the overall structure of the prospect and to determine what additional work may be required 
the remaining holes all intersected widespread quartz sulfide containing pyrrhotite  chalcopyrite  and arsenopyrite and contained anomalous gold  copper  bismuth  and arsenic 
the drill hole data is currently being reviewed and additional drilling may be recommended 
rkd six holes totalling  meters were completed on the target known as rkd during the holes intersected a north northwest trending mineralized shear zone dipping steeply to the west 
the best gold intercept was in hole rkd  which contained meters of gold grams per tonne 
hole rkd intersected meters of copper and ppm silvern in a chalcocite rich part of the shear zone 
all of the holes intersected anomalous gold with values up to and gold grams per tonne 
silver spray two holes totalling meters were completed at silver spray in september both holes intersected several meter zones of strong quartz veining with galena  pyrrhotite and arsenopyrite 
these zones contained anomalous lead  zinc  and arsenic but only sporadic anomalous gold up to gold grams per tonne 
snowdrop six soil geochemical lines were completed in across the snowdrop anomaly 
these soils were collected on a meter spacing to infill the existing meter grid 
the results confirmed and refined the previously defined gold copper arsenic bismuth anomaly with samples of samples containing ppm or greater copper and samples containing greater than ppb gold high value ppb 
the onset of the wet season has suspended work on the target until next spring 
a drill plan will be included in the updated mine management plan to permit drilling in quigleys quigleys is a known gold occurrence that has been mined to shallow depths 
we decided to explore further and  in  three holes totalling meters were completed to test the high grade shear zone and to explore hanging and footwall quartz veining described in some of the historic drill holes 
the main zone appears to be a quartz healed shear zone with arsenopyrite and pyrrhotite that ranges from one to two meters in thickness 
however  the amount of quartz veining in vq and vq is surprising and bears a marked resemblance to the batman core zone with a strong density of sheeted quartz pyrrhotite veins in to meter zones 
assay results confirm the presence of significant gold mineralization in the hanging and foot wall zones of the main mineralized shear 
because most of the historic drilling was reverse circulation  this mineralization has not been incorporated into the quigleys resource model 
in addition  most of historic drilling in the area was not sufficiently deep to intersect the footwall mineralization encountered in hole vq and this zone represents an intriguing batman style exploration target 
guadalupe de los reyes gold silver project  mexico recent exploration and development on april   we announced that following a detailed review of the historic data from which we identified priority targets  that we intended to commence field exploration work in  including field mapping and definition of drill targets 
prior exploration took place from  a period during which the silver price ranged from per ounce and there was little incentive to evaluate the geologic potential for higher grade silver zones  similar to those which existed in the vein system mined by previous underground mining operations 
equally important  no significant studies were completed to fully evaluate the production potential of silver with extensive metallurgical testing 
vista s drill plan is focused on confirming the bulk mineable resource estimates already identified and examining the high grade potential of the underground minable vein systems in the district and in the lower zones of the historic mine operations 
following the drilling program  vista plans to commence a systematic metallurgical testing program so that the economic potential of the deposit can be evaluated 
the style of mineralization is similar to that of primero mining s tayoltita operation located kilometers to the southeast with a historic production of greater than million ounces of gold and million ounces of silver 
following extensive geologic mapping and surface sampling  on october   we received the government permits for our planned drilling program  and with an agreement for surface exploration rights with the ejido la tasajera  we announced that drilling program would soon start this program is designed to accomplish two objectives obtain core for metallurgical testing from the stockwork that is the host for the project s current reported estimated mineral resources  and test the potential for high gold grades and bonanza silver grades in the underlying lse vein systems 
if this initial core drilling program is successful  we intend to undertake more comprehensive drilling 
at this time  we are planning to initiate work to complete a preliminary economic assessment in the latter part of drilling commenced on november  and continued through december   when the program halted for the christmas holidays 
energold drill co 
was contracted for the work and at the end of december had completed ten core holes totaling meters 
all of the drilling targeted the guadalupe vein system which can be traced over a distance of kilometers 
approximately kilometers of strike length was extensively developed by historic mining with underground workings extending meters vertically 
guadalupe west in the guadalupe west area  six holes were drilled down dip and along strike from previous drilling 
three additional holes were drilled to explore the projection of the vein to the east in an area with no prior drilling 
these holes were designed to test potential veining below surface stockwork outcrops that have returned assays ranging from one to four gold grams per tonne 
the final hole targeted high grade mineralization east of the main area of historic production 
six of the holes intersected to meters of quartz veins and stockwork zones 
in this area  the vein is typically five to eight meters wide with stockwork veining extending an additional to meters up the hole 
the following table summarizes the results of the drilling program as reported in a press released on january  the drilling was oriented to intersect the vein system at right angles to provide a close approximation of true width

this area consists of a branching system of epithermal veins and stockwork zones that were the focus of much of the historic underground mining in the district 
one core hole totaling meters was completed prior to the holiday break 
the hole intersected feldspar porphyry with silicified and argillically altered zones with minor zones of pyrite bearing quartz stockwork 
as we announced on february   drilling with one drill resumed on january  and a second drill began drilling on january  assays have been received from three holes  two from the guadalupe vein and one from the el zapote vein 
the intercepts from the guadalupe vein confirm our hypothesis that there is potential for high grade gold silver mineralization in the district 
based on the depths of stopes from historic operations  it is estimated that the intercepts in the guadalupe vein are a couple hundred meters above the base of the productive zone 
neither drill hole from the guadalupe vein reached the planned target depth due to difficult drilling conditions  though  assay results from gv indicated strong mineralization at the bottom of the hole 
the results from the first hole from the el zapote vein system are encouraging and confirm the presence of near surface stockwork veining previously defined by reverse circulation drilling 
the results are summarized on the following table 
the equivalent gold grade au equiv was calculated using a metal price ratio of  that is  grams silver equals gram equivalent of gold 
this drilling program  including the logging  photographing  and sampling by contractors of vista  was conducted under the supervision of vista s vice president of exploration  mr 
frank fenne pg  who is a qualified person within the meaning of ni samples were shipped to the alschemex sample prep lab in hermosillo  mexico 
prepared sample pulps were shipped by alschemex to its assay lab in vancouver 
gold was analyzed using a gram fire assay with an atomic absorption spectroscopy aas finish 
silver was initially analyzed using a element icp analysis using a four acid digestion 
silver assays greater than grams per tonne were re assayed using a gram fire assay with a gravimetric finish and these results replaced the aas finish 
an on going quality control quality assurance protocol was employed in the program that includes standards and blanks in every batch of assays 
check assays were conducted on every twentieth sample by a second independent laboratory

the high grade mineralization intersected in gv from to meters occurs in a brecciated quartz vein and resulted in a lower core recovery approx 
than has been typically encountered 
it is likely that finely ground rock was washed from the core 
the grade of the interval without this loss of material could be lower or higher than reported 
the planned program of  meters of drilling is expected to be completed by the end of the first half concordia gold project on february   we announced that we have entered into an earn in right agreement the earn in right agreement with mexico based invecture group  sa de sa invecture with respect to our concordia gold project 
we hold the concordia gold project through our wholly owned  mexican subsidiary  desarrollos zapal  sa de sa dz mexico 
under the terms of the agreement  invecture made a non refundable payment of  in exchange for the right to earn a interest subject to adjustment in dz mexico the earn in right 
the earn in right will expire if not exercised by february   subject to extension in certain circumstances the earn in period 
the earn in right agreement provides that during the earn in period  invecture will  at its sole expense  manage and operate the concordia gold project and will undertake all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the change of forest land use permit cusf and the authorization of environmental impact which are required to develop the project 
invecture has advised that it will secure  in project debt finance to construct the concordia gold project after it has exercised the earn in right and after a project development decision has been made 
once invecture has earned its interest in the concordia gold project  the parties have agreed to evaluate market conditions with regard to the future organization and ownership structure of dz mexico 
the earn in right agreement provides that the exercise of the earn in right by invecture is conditional upon  among other things i receipt of the cusf and the authorization of environmental impact  ii the completion of a feasibility report on the concordia gold project which updates the existing feasibility report with respect to costs  iii invecture funding the concordia gold project during the earn in period  and iv invecture making an additional payment of  to dz mexico  which amount will be used to repay intercompany loans owed by dz mexico to vista 
during the earn in period and subject to the terms of the earn in right agreement  vista holds of the dz mexico shareholder voting rights 
the remaining of the dz mexico shareholder voting rights are held in a trust that will be instructed by representatives of vista and invecture 
upon invecture s exercise of the earn in right  vista will continue to hold a interest subject to adjustment in dz mexico and the concordia gold project 
as part of the agreement  dz mexico has transferred all of its other material assets  including the mill equipment acquired by vista for the concordia gold project in and the guadalupe de los reyes gold silver project  to other entities in the vista group of companies 
vista has granted invecture the option to cause dz mexico to acquire the mill equipment for  plus storage  insurance and transportation costs and any applicable taxes 
this option is exercisable by invecture during the first months after the date of the agreement 
change of forest land use permit application status on february   we announced that the mexican secretariat of the environment and natural resources semarnat had dismissed our application for the cusf 
in its dismissal  semarnat had questioned the validity of the temporary occupation permits top issued by the general direction of mines in the secretariat of economy  which were required as part of the cusf application 
semarnat also identified the need for additional technical studies 
on july   we announced an update on the status of our cusf permit application  technical programs in progress  and a general overview of the development of the project 
the concordia gold project is located in a special use area on the northern limit of the buffer zone of the sierra de la laguna biosphere the biosphere 
in the immediate concordia gold project area  we had believed that the surface land was divided between land owned directly by dz mexico and a parcel of federal land that had yet to be defined by the mexican secretariat of agrarian reform sra  although the process for doing so was underway 
in the process of working our way through the sra process of defining the limits of the supposed federal land  we became convinced that the land was removed from the federal domain in the late s 
consequently we executed a contract to acquire the parcel of land and have filed documents with sra to have our ownership of this parcel officially recognized 
we believe that we are close to receiving the official recognition 
if we are successful in our attempt to gain this official recognition of our ownership of all the surface land in the project area  sra must also rule to deny the request of the mexican nation commission for natural protected area conanp to become the administrator of these lands 
awak mas gold project  sulawesi  indonesia on december   we announced that our wholly owned subsidiary vista barbados had signed a joint venture agreement with pan asia resources corporation pan asia with respect to the development of the awak mas gold project 
the joint venture agreement the jv agreement provides pan asia  a privately held resource development company  with the opportunity to earn a interest in the awak mas project by i expending  on the project within the next months  ii completing an environmental impact assessment and feasibility study in compliance with ni  each of which is required by the contract of work cow granted by the indonesian government under which the awak mas project is held  and iii issuing to vista gold two million shares of pan asia and the right to purchase up to an additional two million shares of pan asia in the event of an initial public offering of pan asia shares on the same terms as offered under such initial public offering 
under the terms of the joint venture agreement  we will retain our controlling interest in the awak mas project until pan asia completes the earn in conditions described above 
on june   our subsidiary  vista barbados  entered into additional option agreement additional option agreement with pan asia 
the additional option agreement provides pan asia with the opportunity to earn an additional interest in our awak mas gold project in indonesia after it has earned a interest in the project pursuant to the jv agreement

we completed the exploration phase of the cow in january and entered the feasibility phase in february the feasibility phase usually lasts one year  but may be negotiated for up to one year extensions 
following the feasibility phase  with government approvals  there would be a construction phase lasting usually three years 
the operating period follows the construction phase  lasting usually to years 
in late  we applied for a suspension of the feasibility period for one year 
before this application was ruled upon  we announced our joint venture agreement with pan asia now one asia  which may have delayed the process 
in april  draft terms of reference for an environmental impact study leading to a new environmental management plan amdal were presented to the environmental department in luwu regency by one asia s operating through our subsidiary  pt masmindo amdal consultant 
because of a delay due to a question by the indonesian government about the project boundary lines  which has since been resolved in our favor  we agreed to extend one asia s time commitments that are in our agreement by that amount of time approximately nine months 
at year end  one asia submitted its terms of reference for completion of the environmental impact study to the provincial government and is awaiting provincial government approval to finalize the amdal process during one asia has applied for another extension to the feasibility period 
one asia commenced it s activities at awak mas in january with the hiring of an experienced project manager and during the second quarter  a senior mining engineer to aid its resource assessment work 
one asia s initial focus was on the mineral resource previously defined at the project and some months were spent on re evaluating the geological database and producing an in house resource model 
tetra tech was hired to do an independent evaluation of its resource model 
in early  one asia reported that it had assembled a team of highly qualified consultants to undertake a preliminary economic assessment or scoping study for the awak mas project 
in  one asia decided to change the scope of the study to a preliminary feasibility study 
the team includes amec minproc for plant and process design  australian mine design development for mine planning and ore reserve definition  golder associates for geotechnical investigations and environmental consulting  resindo resources for infrastructure and local costs  and tetra tech for mineral resource evaluation 
in  alsammtec was added to the team for metallurgical studies 
initial site visits by one asia s consulting team was undertaken during the fourth quarter and further site visits were made during during a number of local community initiatives were undertaken 
an environmental and community development manager was hired in august to co ordinate permitting efforts  preparation of the environmental impact study and community relations 
a program of infill and exploration drilling commenced in early this program is designed to upgrade inferred resources to indicated status so they can be included in the preliminary feasibility study which was started in early  and also provide core samples for additional metallurgical testing in australia to aid the process design work being undertaken by amec minproc 
additionally  exploration and condemnation drilling was planned 
geoassay laboratory is doing the assaying with check assaying by pt intertek indonesia and alsammtec is doing the metallurgical testing 
in addition  four core holes for geotechnical purposes were drilled into designed pit walls 
as of the end of november the end of the drilling season  core holes had been drilled into the awak mas deposit for  meters  including the four geotechnical core drill holes  six exploration core holes had been drilled into the rutuk area for meters and nine exploration core holes had been drilled in the salu bulo area for meters 
exploration drilling resumed in february subsequent events on january   we granted  restricted stock units rsus to certain employees 
the terms of the restricted stock units agreement provide that the vesting period for the rsus is at least one year and that the rsus will vest when the average adjusted value of our common shares or shares plus dividends or distribution value measured over any consecutive day period is two times the closing trading price of the common shares as listed on the new york stock exchange american exchange nyse amex on november  of per share 
the adjusted value is the closing trading price of the common shares as listed on the nyse amex on any given day divided by one plus the percentage change increase decrease from date the rsus were granted to the current date of the average of the amex gold basket of unhedged gold stocks index hui and the philadelphia gold and silver sector index xau 
in the event the share price vesting provision is met prior to the end of one year  the rsus will vest at the end of one year regardless of the share price at that time

significant accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements significant accounting policies basis of presentation we have  from our inception until december   reported to securities regulators in both canada and the us using canadian generally accepted accounting principles gaap financial statements with reconciliation to us gaap 
however  a change in the position of the united states securities and exchange commission sec in late required canadian companies  such as vista  that do not qualify as foreign private issuers to file their financial statements in the us using us gaap for periods beginning after december  therefore  we have retrospectively adopted us gaap effective january  for all us and canadian filings 
canadian securities regulators announced that they will continue to accept financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap 
a comparison of our december  and balance sheets in us gaap to our balance sheet at december  as reported in canadian gaap is as follows us gaap december  us gaap december  canadian gaap december  assets cash and cash equivalents    mineral properties    other assets    total assets    liabilities    shareholders equity    total liabilities and shareholders equity   note the decrease in mineral properties and increase in the shareholders equity during exploration stage is due to the conversion to us gaap from canadian gaap 
in accordance with us gaap  our property acquisition costs  including directly related acquisition costs  are capitalized when incurred  and mineral property exploration costs are expensed as incurred 
under canadian gaap  however  both acquisition costs and exploration expenditures had been capitalized when incurred 
use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant areas requiring the use of estimates include capital costs of projects  mine closure and reclamation obligations  useful lives for asset depreciation purposes  impairment of mineral properties  deferred income taxes  valuation of investments and the calculation of stock based compensation 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand  demand balances held with banks and certificates of deposit all with maturities of three months or less when purchased 
marketable securities we classify marketable securities as available for sale 
accordingly  these securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses being reported in other comprehensive income until such time that the securities are disposed of or become impaired 
at that time  any gains or losses will then be realized and reported in our consolidated statement of income loss 
we use the specific identification method for determining carrying value in computing realized gains and losses on sales of investment securities 
we evaluate investments in a loss position to determine if such a loss is other than temporary 
if so  such loss will be recognized and reported during that period 
mineral properties mineral property acquisition costs  including directly related acquisition costs  are capitalized when incurred  and mineral property exploration costs are expensed as incurred 
when we determine that a mineral property can be economically developed in accordance with us gaap  the costs then incurred to develop such property are capitalized 
when ore reserves associated with the projects can be determined  capitalized costs will be depleted using the units of production method over the estimated life of the proven and probable reserves 
if mineral properties are subsequently abandoned or impaired  any capitalized costs will be charged to loss in that period 
we assess the carrying cost of our mineral properties for impairment whenever information or circumstances indicate the potential for impairment 
such evaluations compare estimated future net cash flows with our carrying costs and future obligations on an undiscounted basis 
if it is determined that the future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the property  a write down to the estimated fair value is charged to loss for the period 
where estimates of future net cash flows are not available and where other conditions suggest impairment  management assesses if the carrying value can be recovered 
plant and equipment plant and equipment are recorded at cost 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  ranging primarily from three to ten years 
significant expenditures that increase the life of an asset  including interest capitalized on expenditures on qualifying assets  are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset 
upon sale or retirement of assets  the costs and related accumulated depreciation or amortization are eliminated from the respective accounts and any resulting gains or losses are reflected in operations 
asset retirement obligation and closure costs the fair value of a liability for our legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets is recognized in the period in which it is incurred 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset unless the asset has been previously written off  in which case the amount is expensed 
the liability will be adjusted for changes in the expected amounts and timing of cash flows required to discharge the liability and accreted to the full value over time through periodic charges to income 
warrants warrants and compensation options issued are recorded at fair value 
stock based compensation we record compensation expense on the granting of all stock based compensation awards  including stock options grants  restricted stock units grants and restricted stock awards grants  calculated using the fair value method 
we use the hull white trinomial method of determining the fair value of the stock option on the date of the grant 
when an option is granted  the fair value of the immediately vested portion is expensed and included within the stock based compensation balance within shareholders equity 
as to the options vesting  the fair value is amortized using the straight line method over the vesting period and expensed on a monthly basis 
when an option is exercised  the grant date fair value of the options is transferred to common stock 
when options are cancelled  the vested fair value balance of the stock options is transferred to additional paid in capital 
when stock options are forfeited prior to becoming fully vested  any expense previously recorded is reversed through income 
when options expire  the related fair value is transferred to additional paid in capital 
we use the fair value method of determining the fair value of restricted stock units and restricted stock awards on the date of grant 
the fair value is amortized using the straight line method over the vesting period and expensed on a monthly basis 
certain restricted stock units vest upon the achievement of specified performance and market criterion  but not to be less than one year 
on a quarterly basis  management  using the best information available through that time  assesses the probability of achieving those performance and market milestones in determining the appropriate vesting period for the purpose of recording the expense associated with those restricted stock units 
on the date of vesting  the grant date fair value of the restricted stock units or restricted stock awards is transferred to common stock 
when restricted stock units or restricted stock awards are forfeited prior to vesting  any expense previously recorded is reversed through income 
foreign currency exchange gains or losses our functional currency is the us dollar 
all of our foreign subsidiaries are direct and integral components of vista and are dependent upon the economic environment of our functional currency 
therefore  the functional currency of our foreign entities is considered to be the us dollar in accordance with the accounting standards codification asc topic  foreign currency matters  and accordingly  translation gains and losses are reported in the loss for that period 
assets and liabilities of these foreign operations are translated using period end exchange rates and revenues and expenses are translated using average exchange rates during each period 
income taxes we provide for income taxes using the liability method of tax allocation 
under this method  deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on deductible or taxable temporary differences between financial statement values and tax values of assets and liabilities using enacted income tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled  based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date 
deferred tax is recognized as income or an expense and included in the profit or loss for the period  except when it arises from a transaction that is recognized directly in equity  in which case the deferred tax is also recognized directly in equity  or when it arises from a business combination that is an acquisition  in which case the deferred tax is included in the resulting goodwill or the amount of any excess of the acquirer s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree s identifiable assets  liabilities and contingent liabilities over the cost of the combination 
we establish a valuation allowance against the future income tax assets if  based on available information  it is more likely than not that all of the assets will not be realized 
uncertainty in income tax positions the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is at least more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the taxing authorities

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are engaged in the acquisition of gold projects and related activities  including exploration  engineering  permitting and the preparation of feasibility studies 
the value of our properties  as well as our marketable securities and our investment in midas  is related to the price of gold  and changes in the price of gold could affect our ability to generate revenue from our portfolio of gold projects 
gold prices may fluctuate widely from time to time and are affected by numerous factors  including the following expectations with respect to the rate of inflation  exchange rates  interest rates  global and regional political and economic circumstances and governmental policies  including those with respect to gold holdings by central banks 
the demand for and supply of gold affect gold prices  but not necessarily in the same manner as demand and supply affect the prices of other commodities 
the supply of gold consists of a combination of new mine production and existing stocks of bullion and fabricated gold held by governments  public and private financial institutions  industrial organizations and private individuals 
the demand for gold primarily consists of jewelry and investments 
additionally  hedging activities by producers  consumers  financial institutions and individuals can affect gold supply and demand 
while gold can be readily sold on numerous markets throughout the world  its market value cannot be predicted for any particular time 
because we have exploration operations in north america  indonesia and australia  we are subject to foreign currency fluctuations 
we do not engage in currency hedging to offset any risk of currency fluctuations  as insignificant monetary amounts are held in foreign currencies for land holding costs related to the properties owned
