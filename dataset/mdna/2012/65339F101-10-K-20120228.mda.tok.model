adjusted earnings nee prepares its financial statements in accordance with gaap 
however  management uses earnings excluding certain items adjusted earnings  a non gaap financial measure  internally for financial planning  for analysis of performance  for reporting of results to the board of directors and as an input in determining whether performance goals are met for performance based compensation under nee s employee incentive compensation plans 
nee also uses adjusted earnings when communicating its financial results and earnings outlook to investors 
nee s management believes adjusted earnings provides a more meaningful representation of the company s fundamental earnings power 
although the excluded amounts are properly included in the determination of net income in accordance with gaap  management believes that the amount and or nature of such items make period to period comparisons of operations difficult and potentially confusing 
adjusted earnings do not represent a substitute for net income  as prepared in accordance with gaap 

table of contents adjusted earnings exclude the unrealized mark to market effect of non qualifying hedges as described below  otti losses on securities held in neer s nuclear decommissioning funds  net of the reversal of previously recognized otti losses on securities sold and losses on securities where price recovery was deemed unlikely collectively  otti reversals and  in  the after tax loss on the sale of natural gas fired generating assets 
otti reversals are reported in other net in nee s consolidated statements of income 
nee and neer segregate into two categories unrealized mark to market gains and losses on energy derivative transactions which are used to manage commodity price risk 
the first category  referred to as trading activities  represents the net unrealized effect of actively traded positions entered into to take advantage of market price movements and  in and  the impact related to exiting hedged positions on future gas drilling opportunities 
the second category  referred to as non qualifying hedges  represents certain hedging transactions entered into as economic hedges but the transactions do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting or hedge accounting treatment is not elected 
changes in the fair value of those transactions are marked to market and reported in the consolidated statements of income  resulting in earnings volatility because the economic offset to the positions which are required to be marked to market such as the physical assets from which power is generated are not marked to market 
as a consequence  net income reflects only the movement in one part of economically linked transactions 
for this reason  nee s management views results expressed excluding the unrealized mark to market impact of the non qualifying hedges as a meaningful measure of current period performance 
at fpl  substantially all changes in the fair value of energy derivative transactions are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until the contracts are settled  and  upon settlement  any gains or losses are passed through the fuel clause or the capacity clause 
see note nonrecurring fair value measurements 
in  subsidiaries of neer completed the sales of their ownership interest in five natural gas fired generating plants with a total generating capacity of approximately  mw located in california  virginia  alabama  south carolina and rhode island 
in connection with these sales  a loss of approximately million million total after tax with million of this loss recorded by neer was recorded in nee s consolidated statements of income  which due to its nature and significance  was excluded from adjusted earnings 
see note the following table provides details of the net unrealized after tax gains and losses from non qualifying hedges  after tax otti losses  net of reversals and the after tax loss on the sale of the natural gas fired generating assets 
years ended december  millions net unrealized mark to market after tax gains losses from non qualifying hedge activity a otti after tax losses on securities held in nuclear decommissioning funds  net of otti reversals after tax loss on sale of natural gas fired assets b a million  million and million  respectively  is included in neer s net income  the balance  if any  is included in corporate and other 
b million is included in neer s net income  the balance is included in corporate and other 
the change in unrealized mark to market activity from non qualifying hedges is primarily attributable to changes in forward power and natural gas prices  as well as the reversal of previously recognized unrealized mark to market gains or losses as the underlying transactions were realized 
as a general rule  a gain loss in the non qualifying hedge category is offset by decreases increases in the fair value of related physical asset positions in the portfolio or contracts  which are not marked to market under gaap 
summary fpl s earned regulatory roe was in both and and fpl expects to earn an regulatory roe in fpl s increase in net income in was primarily driven by investments in plant in service and fpl s ability to use the surplus depreciation credit  as permitted under the rate agreement  to earn up to fpl s allowed regulatory roe on its retail rate base  as well as higher cost recovery clause results 
the rate agreement results in retail base rates that remain effectively frozen until the end of additionally  cost recovery for fpl s wcec unit no 
is permitted during the term of the agreement and fpl can vary the amount of surplus depreciation amortized in any one year subject to certain caps  provided its retail regulatory return on equity remains within the allowed range of to neer s earnings declined in reflecting the loss on sale of natural gas fired generating assets  lower results from the customer supply and proprietary power and gas trading businesses  extended and unplanned outages at seabrook and lower deferred tax benefits associated with cash grants convertible itcs  partly offset by a higher wind resource and higher gas infrastructure results 
in  neer added mw of wind capacity and secured approximately  mw of long term wind power sales agreements 
additionally  in construction began on the mw genesis solar project in california and the mw desert sunlight solar project in california  in which neer has a equity investment 

table of contents corporate and other s earnings in increased primarily due to state deferred income tax benefits related to state tax law changes and an income tax benefit related to the dissolution of a subsidiary 
nee and its subsidiaries  including fpl  require funds to support and grow their businesses 
these funds are primarily provided by cash flow from operations and short and long term borrowings and  from time to time  issuance of equity securities 
as of february   nee s total net available liquidity was approximately billion  of which fpl s portion was approximately billion 
outlook nee s strategy at both of its major businesses seeks to meet customer needs more economically and reliably than competitors 
meeting customer needs frequently requires the commitment of large capital expenditures to projects that have long lives and such commitments are difficult to reverse once made 
at the end of  both fpl and neer had made commitments to a variety of major capital projects that are expected to be completed over the next several years 
while nee management believes that these projects individually and collectively are attractive investments with the potential to create value for shareholders  there can be no guarantee that all or any of these projects will be successful 
because of their importance  management focuses particular attention on these large projects 
in  nee expects to focus efforts in particular on the following initiatives at fpl sustaining fpl s customer value proposition 
the combination of low bills  good reliability and excellent customer service that fpl currently provides its customers is both an objective of fpl s strategy and an important contributor to its long term business success 
fpl seeks to  at minimum  maintain and ideally improve its overall customer value proposition 
major capital projects fpl is currently in a large capital expansion program and its objective is to bring these projects in on schedule and within budget 
this program includes modernizing its cape canaveral and riviera beach power plants to high efficiency natural gas fired  mw units to be placed in service by and  respectively  adding a total of approximately mw to mw of capacity at its existing nuclear units at st 
lucie and turkey point  to be placed in service by  and petitioning the fpsc in november to modernize its port everglades power plant to a high efficiency natural gas fired  mw unit which  if approved  is expected to be in service in and cost approximately billion 
rate case in january  fpl filed a formal notification with the fpsc indicating its intent to initiate a base rate proceeding 
the notification stated that  based on preliminary estimates  fpl expects to request a base rate increase of approximately million effective january and an additional base rate increase of approximately million annually commencing when the modernized cape canaveral plant becomes operational  which is expected to occur in june at neer maintaining excellence in day to day operations 
neer has developed a track record of generally running its facilities reliably and cost effectively 
the company seeks to  at minimum  maintain and ideally improve its operating performance 
wind add approximately  mw to  mw of new us wind generation in and mw of new canadian wind generation between and  and solar add approximately mw of new solar generation during the period through  including the mw genesis solar project in california  the mw spain solar project  the mw desert sunlight solar project in california  in which neer has a equity investment  and the mw mccoy solar pv project located in the mojave desert near the genesis and desert sunlight solar projects 
at lone star  which is in the process of constructing approximately miles of transmission lines and other associated facilities in texas construction achieve commercial operations by the end of the first quarter of rate case in january  lone star filed a petition with the puct requesting  among other things  interim rates which would take effect when lone star s first substation is placed in service  currently projected to be in  and final rates when the transmission lines are energized 
if approved  based on the expected in service dates  the requested rates would result in annual revenues of approximately million in and million in in addition  nee and fpl devote effort to numerous other initiatives designed to support their long term growth and development 
there can be no guarantees that nee or fpl will be successful in attaining their goals with respect to any of these initiatives 
for additional information on certain of the above matters  see item business 

table of contents results of operations nee s net income for was billion  compared to billion in and billion in the decrease in nee s net income was primarily driven by lower earnings at neer  partly offset by improved results at fpl and income tax benefits at corporate and other 
the increase in nee s net income was primarily driven by improved results at fpl and by net unrealized mark to market after tax gains from non qualifying hedges at neer 
nee s effective income tax rate for all periods presented reflects ptcs for wind projects at neer and deferred tax benefits associated with convertible itcs under the recovery act 
ptcs and deferred tax benefits associated with convertible itcs can significantly affect nee s effective income tax rate depending on the amount of pretax income 
ptcs can be significantly affected by wind generation and by the expiration of ptcs after ten years of production

fpl obtains its operating revenues primarily from the sale of electricity to retail customers at rates established by the fpsc through base rates and cost recovery clause mechanisms 
in and  fpl earned a regulatory roe of  as permitted by the rate agreement  and expects to earn an regulatory roe in in and in  growth in earnings for fpl was driven by investment in plant in service and fpl s ability to use the surplus depreciation credit  and higher cost recovery clause results  partly offset for by  lower afudc equity 
fpl s operating revenues consisted of the following years ended december  millions retail base fuel cost recovery net deferral of retail fuel revenues net repayment of previously deferred retail fuel revenues other cost recovery clauses and pass through costs  net of any deferrals other  primarily pole attachment rentals  transmission and wholesale sales and customer related fees total retail base as permitted by the rate agreement  fpl collected approximately million in retail base revenues through the capacity clause related to the placement in service of wcec unit no 
in may in addition  a base rate increase pursuant to an fpsc order which became effective march   increased retail base revenues by approximately million and million in and  respectively  and retail base revenues increased in by million resulting from wcec unit nos 
and placed in service in fpsc rate order effective march   pursuant to the fpsc rate order  new retail base rates for fpl were established  resulting in an increase in retail base revenues of approximately million on an annualized basis 
the fpsc rate order also established a regulatory roe of with a range of plus or minus basis points and an adjusted regulatory equity ratio of 
it also shifted certain costs from retail base rates to the capacity clause 
in addition  the fpsc rate order directed fpl to reduce depreciation expense surplus depreciation credit over the to period related to a depreciation reserve surplus 
subsequently  the principal parties in fpl s rate case signed the rate agreement and  in february  the fpsc issued a final order approving the rate agreement 
key elements of that rate agreement  which is effective through december   are as follows subject to the provisions of the rate agreement  retail base rates are effectively frozen through the end of incremental cost recovery through fpl s capacity clause for the new combined cycle natural gas unit at wcec unit no 
 which was placed in service in may  is permitted up to the amount of the projected annual fuel savings for customers during the term of the rate agreement 
future storm restoration costs would be recoverable on an accelerated basis beginning days from the filing of a cost recovery 
table of contents petition  but capped at an amount that produces a surcharge of no more than for every  kwh of usage on residential bills during the first months of cost recovery 
any additional costs would be eligible for recovery in subsequent years 
if storm restoration costs exceed million in any given calendar year  fpl may request an increase to the surcharge to recover the amount above million 
if fpl s earned regulatory roe falls below  fpl may seek retail base rate relief 
if fpl s earned regulatory roe rises above  any party to the rate agreement may seek a reduction in fpl s retail base rates 
in determining the regulatory roe for all purposes under the rate agreement  earnings will be calculated on an actual  non weather adjusted basis 
fpl can vary the amount of surplus depreciation credit taken in any calendar year up to a cap in of million  a cap in subsequent years of million plus the amount of any unused portion from prior years  and a total cap of million surplus depreciation credit cap over the course of the rate agreement  provided that in any year of the rate agreement  fpl must use at least enough surplus depreciation credit to maintain a earned regulatory roe but may not use any amount of surplus depreciation credit that would result in an earned regulatory roe in excess of 
in and  fpl used a total of million of surplus depreciation credit  million of the surplus depreciation credit cap remains available for use in under the terms of the rate agreement  which was in effect from january  through february   retail base rates did not increase except to allow recovery of the revenue requirements of fpl s three power plants that achieved commercial operation during the term of the rate agreement turkey point unit no 
in and wcec units nos 
and in under the terms of the rate agreement  fpl s electric property depreciation rates were based upon the comprehensive depreciation studies it filed with the fpsc in march  however  fpl reduced depreciation on its plant in service by million each year as allowed by the rate agreement 
the rate agreement also provided for a revenue sharing mechanism  whereby revenues from retail base operations in excess of certain thresholds would be shared with customers 
during the term of the rate agreement  fpl s revenues did not exceed the thresholds 
retail customer usage and growth for the year ended december   fpl experienced a decrease in average usage per retail customer  reflecting weather and other factors  which decreased retail base revenues by approximately million 
for the year ended december   fpl experienced a increase in usage per retail customer  reflecting weather and other factors  which increased retail base revenues by approximately million 
the usage per retail customer data for the year ended december  includes three extra days of sales after adjusting for a change from a fiscal month to a calendar month 
at december   inactive accounts accounts with installed meters without corresponding customer names and low usage customers customers using less than kwh per month  both measures of empty homes  were approximately and less  respectively  than they had been at december  non weather related usage per retail customer began to decline in the mid s and this decline intensified in the to period 
the rate of decline in non weather related usage per retail customer moderated in and for the year ended december   fpl experienced a increase in the average number of customer accounts  increasing retail base revenues by approximately million  compared to a increase in customer accounts in  which increased retail base revenues by million 
positive customer account growth is projected to continue in  although the rate of growth is projected to be below fpl s average rate of over the last years 
fpl believes that the economic slowdown and the downturn in the housing market that have affected the country and the state of florida have contributed to the slowdown in customer growth and to the decline in non weather related usage per retail customer 
the unemployment rate in florida was and in december and  respectively  the december rate is the lowest since april a portion of the decline in non weather related usage per retail customer may also be related to federal and state energy efficiency standards 
fpl is unable to predict whether or when growth in customers and non weather related customer usage might return to previous trends 
cost recovery clauses in  and  cost recovery clauses contributed million  million  million  respectively  to fpl s net income 
the increase in and cost recovery clause results is primarily due to a return related to additional solar  environmental and nuclear capacity expenditures 
in  it is expected that cost recovery clauses will contribute higher earnings for fpl as a result of additional nuclear capacity expenditures 
fluctuations in fuel cost recovery revenues are primarily driven by changes in fuel and energy charges which are included in fuel  purchased power and interchange expense in the consolidated statements of income  as well as by changes in energy sales 
fluctuations in revenues from other cost recovery clauses and pass through costs are primarily driven by changes in storm related surcharges  capacity charges  franchise fee costs  the impact of changes in o m and depreciation expenses on the underlying cost recovery clause  investment in solar and environmental projects  investment in nuclear capacity until such capacity goes into service  pre construction costs associated with the development of two additional nuclear units at the turkey point site and changes in energy sales 
capacity charges and franchise fee costs are included in fuel  purchased power and interchange and taxes other than income taxes and other  respectively  in the consolidated statements of income 

table of contents risk management fuel procurement program fpl uses a risk management fuel procurement program which was approved by the fpsc 
the fpsc reviews the program activities and results for prudence on an annual basis as part of its annual review of fuel costs 
the program is intended to manage fuel price volatility by locking in fuel prices for a portion of fpl s fuel requirements 
the current regulatory asset for the change in fair value of derivative instruments used in the fuel procurement program amounted to approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
in  pursuant to an fpsc order  fpl was required to refund in the form of a one time credit to retail customers bills the year end estimated fuel overrecovery  during the first quarter of  approximately million was refunded to retail customers 
at december   approximately million of retail fuel revenues were overrecovered  the reversal of which is reflected in the net repayment of previously deferred retail fuel revenues caption included in the table above 
the difference between the refund and the december  overrecovery was collected from retail customers in the increase in fuel revenues in reflects the absence of the million refund partly offset by approximately million related to lower energy sales and million related to a lower average fuel factor 
the decrease in fuel revenues in reflects the million refund and approximately  million related to a lower average fuel factor  partly offset by million attributable to higher energy sales 
the decrease from december  to december  in deferred clause and franchise expenses and in deferred clause and franchise revenues was approximately million and positively affected nee s and fpl s cash flows from operating activities for the year ended december  other the decrease in revenues from other cost recovery clauses and pass through costs in is primarily due to lower revenues associated with the fpsc s nuclear cost recovery rule and lower revenues related to franchise and revenue taxes  partly offset by higher environmental clause revenues 
the decline in in revenues associated with the nuclear cost recovery rule is primarily due to lower spending related to the development of the two additional nuclear units at the turkey point site 
the decline in revenues related to franchise and revenue taxes reflects the decline in fuel revenues 
the nuclear cost recovery rule provides for the recovery of prudently incurred pre construction costs and carrying charges equal to a pretax afudc rate on construction costs for new nuclear capacity through levelized charges under the capacity clause 
the same rule provides for the recovery of construction costs  once property related to the new nuclear capacity goes into service  through a base rate increase effective beginning the following january 
other items impacting fpl results fuel  purchased power and interchange the major components of fpl s fuel  purchased power and interchange expense are as follows years ended december  millions fuel and energy charges during the period net collection of previously deferred retail fuel costs net deferral of retail fuel costs other  primarily capacity charges  net of any capacity deferral total the decrease in fuel and energy charges in reflects lower fuel and energy prices of million and lower energy sales of million 
the decrease in fuel and energy charges in reflects lower fuel and energy prices of approximately million  partly offset by approximately million attributable to higher energy sales 
o m expenses fpl s o m expenses increased million in primarily due to higher cost recovery clause costs which did not significantly affect net income 
fpl s o m expenses increased million in reflecting an approximately million charge for workforce reductions and higher nuclear and fossil generation  distribution  transmission and nuclear insurance costs of million  million  million  million and million  respectively  partly offset by lower customer service costs  primarily due to lower uncollectible accounts  of million 
the increase in nuclear generation costs is primarily due to higher maintenance costs and reflects a reimbursement in of prior years costs of approximately million related to a spent nuclear fuel litigation settlement agreement with the us government 
the increase in fossil generation costs is primarily related to wcec units nos 
and  which units were placed in service in the second half of  and higher plant overhaul costs 
the increase in distribution and transmission costs reflects higher restoration and tree trimming costs 
other changes in o m expenses were primarily driven by pass through costs which did not significantly affect net income

under the terms of the rate agreement  fpl can vary the amount of surplus depreciation credit taken in any calendar year up to a cap in of million  a cap in subsequent years of million plus the amount of any unused portion from prior years  and a cap of million surplus depreciation credit cap over the to period 
in any year of the rate agreement fpl must use at least enough surplus depreciation credit to maintain a earned regulatory roe but may not use any amount of surplus depreciation credit that would result in an earned regulatory roe in excess of 
as of december   approximately million of the surplus depreciation credit cap remains available for use in the increase in other depreciation and amortization expense recovered under base rates in is primarily due to higher plant in service balances 
the decline in other depreciation and amortization expense recovered under base rates in is primarily due to lower depreciation rates as a result of the fpsc rate order  partly offset by higher plant in service balances related to wcec units nos 
and  which were placed in service in the decrease in depreciation and amortization recovered under cost recovery clauses and securitized storm recovery cost amortization in and is primarily due to lower depreciation and amortization under the fpsc s nuclear cost recovery rule 
see note electric plant  depreciation and amortization 
taxes other than income taxes and other taxes other than income taxes and other increased million in primarily due to higher franchise fees and revenue taxes  both of which are pass through costs and reflect the increase in revenues from fuel and other cost recovery clauses and pass through costs 
taxes other than income taxes and other decreased by million in primarily due to changes in franchise fees and revenue taxes 
in addition  taxes other than income taxes and other in and reflect higher property taxes of million and million  respectively  primarily due to growth in plant in service balances and  in  a higher average property tax rate  partly offset in by a lower average property tax rate 
interest expense the increase in interest expense in is primarily due to higher average interest rates and higher average debt balances 
the increase in interest expense in is primarily due to higher average debt balances  as well as lower afudc debt

clause interest for  and amounted to approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
the increase in clause interest in and is primarily due to higher interest associated with solar  environmental and nuclear capacity expenditures 
afudc equity the decrease in afudc equity in is primarily attributable to wcec units nos 
and  which units commenced commercial operation in  partly offset by additional afudc equity on wcec unit no 
the decrease in afudc equity in also reflects a decline  effective april   in the afudc rate from to  as approved by the fpsc

the federal and state income tax benefits reflect consolidating income tax adjustments and include the following the items in  a state deferred income tax benefit of approximately million  net of federal income taxes  related to state tax law changes  in  an income tax benefit of million related to the dissolution of a subsidiary  in  a million expense associated with the loss on sale of natural gas fired generating assets  and in  an income tax benefit of million related to employee benefits 
other includes all other corporate income and expenses  as well as other business activities 
the decline in other in is primarily due to an million after tax loss on the sale of assets held under leveraged leases  the pretax amount million of such loss is reflected in other net in nee s consolidated statements of income 
liquidity and capital resources nee and its subsidiaries  including fpl  require funds to support and grow their businesses 
these funds are used for  among other things  working capital  capital expenditures  investments in or acquisitions of assets and businesses  payment of maturing debt obligations and  from time to time  redemption or repurchase of outstanding debt or equity securities 
it is anticipated that these requirements will be satisfied through a combination of cash flow from operations  short and long term borrowings  and the issuance  from time to time  of short and long term debt and equity securities  consistent with nee s and fpl s objective of maintaining  on a long term basis  a capital structure that will support a strong investment grade credit rating 
nee  fpl and neech rely on access to credit and capital markets as significant sources of liquidity for capital requirements and other operations that are not satisfied by operating cash flows 
the inability of nee  fpl and neech to maintain their current credit ratings could affect their ability to raise short and long term capital  their cost of capital and the execution of their respective financing strategies  and could require the posting of additional collateral under certain agreements

dodd frank act the dodd frank act  enacted into law in july  among other things  provides for the regulation of the otc derivatives market 
the dodd frank act includes provisions that will require certain otc derivatives  or swaps  to be centrally cleared and executed through an exchange or other approved trading platform 
while the legislation is broad and detailed  substantial portions of the legislation require implementing rules to be adopted by federal governmental agencies including  but not limited to  the sec and the cftc 
while some provisions of the statute related to otc derivatives are currently in effect or have been finalized  the majority of the rules are expected to be finalized and implemented in nee and fpl cannot predict the impact of the final rules that will be adopted to implement the otc derivative related provisions of the dodd frank act 
those rules could negatively affect nee s and fpl s ability to hedge their commodity and interest rate risks  which could have a material effect on nee s and fpl s risk exposure and financial results 
the rules also could cause neer to decide to restructure part of its energy marketing and trading operations or to discontinue certain portions of that business 
in addition  if the rules require nee and fpl to post significant amounts of cash collateral with respect to swap transactions  nee s and fpl s liquidity could be materially affected  and their ability to enter into otc derivatives 
table of contents to hedge commodity and interest rate risks could be significantly limited 
reporting and compliance requirements of the rules also could significantly increase operating costs and expose nee and fpl to penalties for any failure to comply with the new requirements 
the financial and operational impact of the final rules cannot be determined at this time  but could be material 
capital support letters of credit  surety bonds and guarantees nee and fpl obtain letters of credit and surety bonds  and issue guarantees to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties and financings 
letters of credit  surety bonds and guarantees support  among other things  the buying and selling of wholesale energy commodities  debt and related reserves  nuclear activities  capital expenditures for wind and solar development and other contractual agreements 
in addition  as part of contract negotiations in the normal course of business  nee and fpl may agree to make payments to compensate or indemnify other parties for possible future unfavorable financial consequences resulting from specified events 
the specified events may include  but are not limited to  an adverse judgment in a lawsuit  the imposition of additional taxes due to a change in tax law or interpretations of the tax law or the non receipt of renewable tax credits or proceeds from cash grants under the recovery act 
nee and fpl are unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments under some of these contracts because events that would obligate them have not yet occurred or  if any such event has occurred  they have not been notified of its occurrence 
in addition  nee has guaranteed certain payment obligations of neech  including most of its debt and all of its debentures and commercial paper issuances  as well as most of its payment guarantees and indemnifications  and neech has guaranteed certain debt and other obligations of neer and its subsidiaries 
see note commitments 
at december   nee had approximately billion of standby letters of credit million for fpl  approximately million of surety bonds million for fpl and approximately billion notional amount of guarantees and indemnifications million for fpl  of which approximately billion million for fpl letters of credit  guarantees and indemnifications have expiration dates within the next five years 
an aggregate of approximately billion million for fpl of the standby letters of credit at december  were issued under fpl s and neech s credit facilities 
each of nee and fpl believe it is unlikely that it would incur any liabilities associated with these letters of credit  surety bonds  guarantees and indemnifications 
accordingly  at december   nee and fpl did not have any liabilities recorded for these letters of credit  surety bonds  guarantees and indemnifications

table of contents nee and its subsidiaries  including fpl  have no credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of outstanding debt 
a change in ratings is not an event of default under applicable debt instruments  and while there are conditions to drawing on the credit facilities noted above  with the exception of the spain senior secured limited recourse loan facility  the maintenance of a specific minimum credit rating is not a condition to drawing on these credit facilities 
commitment fees and interest rates on loans under these credit facilities agreements are tied to credit ratings 
a ratings downgrade also could reduce the accessibility and increase the cost of commercial paper and other short term debt issuances and additional or replacement credit facilities 
in addition  a ratings downgrade could result in the requirement that nee subsidiaries  including fpl  post collateral under certain agreements  including those related to fuel procurement  power sales and purchases  nuclear decommissioning funding  debt related reserves and trading activities 
fpl s and neech s credit facilities are available to support these potential requirements 
covenants nee s charter does not limit the dividends that may be paid on its common stock 
as a practical matter  the ability of nee to pay dividends on its common stock is dependent upon  among other things  dividends paid to it by its subsidiaries 
for example  fpl pays dividends to nee in a manner consistent with fpl s long term targeted capital structure 
however  the mortgage securing fpl s first mortgage bonds contains provisions which  under certain conditions  restrict the payment of dividends to nee and the issuance of additional first mortgage bonds 
additionally  in some circumstances  the mortgage restricts the amount of retained earnings that fpl can use to pay cash dividends on its common stock 
the restricted amount may change based on factors set out in the mortgage 
other than this restriction on the payment of common stock dividends  the mortgage does not restrict fpl s use of retained earnings 
as of december   no retained earnings were restricted by these provisions of the mortgage and in light of fpl s current financial condition and level of earnings  management does not expect that planned financing activities or dividends would be affected by these limitations 
fpl may issue first mortgage bonds under its mortgage subject to its meeting an adjusted net earnings test set forth in the mortgage  which generally requires adjusted net earnings to be at least twice the annual interest requirements on  or at least of the aggregate principal amount of  fpl s first mortgage bonds including those to be issued and any other non junior fpl indebtedness 
as of december   coverage for the months ended december  would have been approximately times the annual interest requirements and approximately times the aggregate principal requirements 
new first mortgage bonds are also limited to an amount equal to the sum of of unfunded property additions after adjustments to offset property retirements  the amount of retired first mortgage bonds or qualified lien bonds and the amount of cash on deposit with the mortgage trustee 
as of december   fpl could have issued in excess of billion of additional first mortgage bonds based on the unfunded property additions and in excess of billion based on retired first mortgage bonds 
as of december   no cash was deposited with the mortgage trustee for these purposes

critical accounting policies and estimates nee s and fpl s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with gaap 
critical accounting policies are those that nee and fpl believe are both most important to the portrayal of their financial condition and results of operations  and require complex  subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
nee and fpl consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing their consolidated financial statements accounting for derivatives and hedging activities nee and fpl use derivative instruments primarily swaps  options  futures and forwards to manage the commodity price risk inherent in the purchase and sale of fuel and electricity  as well as interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with outstanding and forecasted debt issuances 
in addition  nee  through neer  uses derivatives to optimize the value of power generation assets and engages in power and gas marketing and trading activities to take advantage of expected future favorable price movements 
nature of accounting estimates accounting pronouncements require the use of fair value accounting if certain conditions are met  which requires significant judgment to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities 
this applies not only to traditional financial derivative instruments  but to any contract having the accounting characteristics of a derivative 
much of the existing accounting guidance related to derivatives focuses on when certain contracts for the purchase and sale of power and certain fuel supply contracts can be excluded from derivative accounting rules  however the guidance does not address all contract issues 
as a result  significant judgment must be used in applying derivatives accounting guidance to contracts 
in the event changes in interpretation occur  it is possible that contracts that currently are excluded from derivatives accounting rules would have to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value  with changes in the fair value recorded in the statement of income 
assumptions and accounting approach nee s and fpl s derivative instruments  when required to be marked to market  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
fair values for some of the longer term contracts where liquid markets are not available are derived through internally developed models which estimate the fair value of a contract by calculating the present value of the difference between the contract price and the forward prices 
forward prices represent the price at which a buyer or seller could contract today to purchase or sell a commodity at a future date 
the near term forward market for electricity is generally liquid and therefore the prices in the early years of the forward curves reflect observable market quotes 
however  in the later years  the market is much less liquid and forward price curves must be developed using factors including the forward prices for the commodities used as fuel to generate electricity  the expected system heat rate which measures the efficiency of power plants in converting fuel to electricity in the region where the purchase or sale takes place  and a fundamental forecast of expected spot prices based on modeled supply and demand in the region 
nee estimates the fair value of interest rate and foreign currency derivatives using a discounted cash flows valuation 
table of contents technique based on the net amount of estimated future cash inflows and outflows related to the derivative agreements 
the assumptions in these models are critical since any changes therein could have a significant impact on the fair value of the derivative 
at fpl  substantially all changes in the fair value of energy derivative transactions are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until the contracts are settled  and  upon settlement  any gains or losses are passed through the fuel clause or the capacity clause 
see note in nee s non rate regulated operations  predominantly neer  all changes in the derivatives fair value for power purchases and sales and trading activities are recognized on a net basis in operating revenues  fuel purchases and sales are recognized on a net basis in fuel  purchased power and interchange expense  and the equity method investees related activity is recognized in equity in earnings of equity method investees in nee s consolidated statements of income  unless the criteria for hedge accounting are met and the company elects to account for the derivative as a hedge 
for those transactions accounted for as cash flow hedges  much of the effects of changes in fair value are reflected in oci  a component of common shareholders equity  rather than being recognized in current earnings 
for those transactions accounted for as fair value hedges  the effects of changes in fair value are reflected in current earnings offset by changes in the fair value of the item being hedged 
certain hedging transactions at neer are entered into as economic hedges but the transactions do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting or hedge accounting treatment is not elected 
changes in the fair value of those transactions are marked to market and reported in the consolidated statements of income  resulting in earnings volatility 
these changes in fair value are captured in the non qualifying hedge category in computing adjusted earnings 
this could be significant to neer s results because the economic offset to the positions which are required to be marked to market such as the physical assets from which power is generated are not marked to market 
as a consequence  net income reflects only the movement in one part of economically linked transactions 
for this reason  nee s management views results expressed excluding the unrealized mark to market impact of the non qualifying hedges as a meaningful measure of current period performance

accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits nee sponsors a qualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plan for substantially all employees of nee and its subsidiaries 
nee also has a supplemental executive retirement plan serp which includes a non qualified supplemental defined benefit pension component that provides benefits to a select group of management and highly compensated employees 
the impact of the serp component is included within the pension plan as discussed below 
management believes that  based on actuarial assumptions and the well funded status of the pension plan  nee will not be required to make any cash contributions to the qualified pension plan in the near future 
in addition to pension benefits  nee sponsors a contributory postretirement plan for health care and life insurance benefits other benefits plan for retirees of nee and its subsidiaries meeting certain eligibility requirements 
the qualified pension plan has a fully funded trust dedicated to providing the benefits under the plan 
the other benefits plan has a partially funded trust dedicated to providing benefits related to life insurance 
nee allocates net periodic benefit income or cost associated with the pension and other benefits plans to its subsidiaries annually using specific criteria 
nature of accounting estimates for the pension plan  the benefit obligation is the actuarial present value as of the december measurement date  of all benefits attributed by the pension benefit formula to employee service rendered to that date 
the amount of benefit to be paid depends on a number of future events incorporated into the pension benefit formula  including estimates of the average life of employees survivors and average years of service rendered 
the projected benefit obligation is measured based on assumptions concerning future interest rates and future employee compensation levels 
for the other benefits plan  the benefit obligation is the actuarial present value as of the december measurement date of all future benefits attributed under the terms of the other benefits plan to employee service rendered to that date 
nee derives pension income and the cost of the other benefits plan from actuarial calculations based on each plan s provisions and management s assumptions regarding discount rate  rate of increase in compensation levels and expected long term rate of return on plan assets and  in the case of the other benefits plan  health care cost trend rates 
assumptions and accounting approach nee s regulatory assets and liabilities are established in association with accounting guidance which requires recognition of the funded status of benefit plans in the balance sheet  with changes in the funded status recognized in comprehensive income within shareholders equity in the year in which the changes occur 
since nee is the plan sponsor  and its subsidiaries do not have separate rights to the plan assets or direct obligations to their employees  this accounting guidance is reflected at nee and not allocated to the subsidiaries 
the portion of previously unrecognized actuarial gains and losses  prior service costs or credits and transition obligations that are estimated to be allocable to fpl as net periodic benefit income cost in future periods and that otherwise would be recorded in aoci are classified as regulatory assets and liabilities at nee in accordance with regulatory 
table of contents treatment 
pension income and the cost of the other benefits plan are included in o m expenses  and are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions 
those assumptions include an expected long term rate of return on qualified plan assets of for all years for the pension plan and for all years for the other benefits plan  assumed increases in salary of for all years  weighted average discount rates of   and for the pension plan and   and for the other benefits plan for the years ended december   and  respectively  and health care cost trend rates as related to other benefits for those under age of for medical and for prescription drug benefits and for those age and over of for medical and for prescription drug benefits 
these rates are assumed to decrease over the next years for medical benefits and years for prescription drug benefits to the ultimate trend rate of and remain at that level thereafter 
the ultimate trend rate is assumed to be reached in for medical benefits and for prescription drug benefits 
in developing these assumptions  nee evaluated input from its actuaries and consultants  as well as information available in the marketplace 
for the expected long term rate of return on fund assets  nee considered different models  capital market return assumptions and historical returns for a portfolio with an equity bond asset mix similar to its funds  as well as its funds historical compounded returns 
nee also considered input  including other qualitative and quantitative factors  from its actuaries and consultants as well as information available in the marketplace 
nee believes that and are reasonable long term rates of return on its pension plan and other benefits plan assets  respectively 
nee will continue to evaluate all of its actuarial assumptions  including its expected rate of return  at least annually  and will adjust them as necessary 
nee bases its determination of pension and other benefits plan expense or income on a market related valuation of assets  as prescribed by accounting guidance 
this market related valuation reduces year to year volatility and recognizes investment gains or losses over a five year period following the year in which they occur 
investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return realized on those assets 
since the market related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five year period  the future value of assets will be affected as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized 
such gains and losses together with other differences between actual results and the estimates used in the actuarial valuations are deferred and recognized in determining pension income and other benefits plan expense only to the extent they exceed of the greater of projected benefit obligations or the market related value of assets 
the following table illustrates the effect on net periodic benefit income of changing the critical actuarial assumptions discussed above  while holding all other assumptions constant increase decrease in net periodic benefit income change in assumption nee fpl expected long term rate of return discount rate salary increase health care cost trend rate a a assumed health care cost trend rates can have a significant effect on the amounts reported for postretirement plans providing health care benefits 
however  this effect is somewhat mitigated by the retiree cost sharing structure incorporated in nee s other benefits plan 
see note carrying value of long lived assets nee evaluates on an ongoing basis the recoverability of its assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
nature of accounting estimates the amount of future net cash flows  the timing of the cash flows and the determination of an appropriate interest rate all involve estimates and judgments about future events 
in particular  the aggregate amount of cash flows determines whether an impairment exists  and the timing of the cash flows is critical in determining fair value 
because each assessment is based on the facts and circumstances associated with each long lived asset  the effects of changes in assumptions cannot be generalized 

table of contents assumptions and accounting approach an impairment loss is required to be recognized if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flows associated with that asset 
the impairment loss to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds the asset s fair value 
in most instances  the fair value is determined by discounting estimated future cash flows using an appropriate interest rate 
see note nonrecurring fair value measurements

b represents total amount accrued for ratemaking purposes 
nature of accounting estimates the calculation of the future cost of retiring long lived assets  including nuclear decommissioning and fossil and solar dismantlement costs  involves estimating the amount and timing of future expenditures and making judgments concerning whether or not such costs are considered a legal obligation 
estimating the amount and timing of future expenditures includes  among other things  making projections of when assets will be retired and ultimately decommissioned and how costs will escalate with inflation 
in addition  nee and fpl also make interest rate and rate of return projections on their investments in determining recommended funding requirements for nuclear decommissioning costs 
periodically  nee and fpl are required to update these estimates and projections which can affect the annual expense amounts recognized  the liabilities recorded and the annual funding requirements for nuclear decommissioning costs 
for example  an increase of in the assumed escalation rates would increase nee s and fpl s asset retirement obligations and conditional asset retirement obligations collectively  aros as of december  by million and million  respectively 
assumptions and accounting approach nee and fpl each account for aros under accounting guidance that requires a liability for the fair value of an aro to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if it can be reasonably estimated  with the offsetting associated asset retirement costs capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived assets 
fpl for ratemaking purposes  fpl accrues and funds for nuclear plant decommissioning costs over the expected service life of each unit based on studies that are filed with the fpsc at least every five years 
the studies reflect  among other things  the expiration dates of the operating licenses for fpl s nuclear units 
the most recent studies  filed in  indicate that fpl s portion of the future cost of decommissioning its four nuclear units  including spent fuel storage above what is expected to be refunded by the doe under the spent fuel settlement agreement  is approximately billion  or billion expressed in dollars 
fpl accrues the cost of dismantling its fossil and solar plants over the expected service life of each unit based on studies filed with the fpsc 
unlike nuclear decommissioning  dismantlement costs are not funded 
the most recent studies became effective january  at december   fpl s portion of the ultimate cost to dismantle its fossil and solar units is approximately million  or million expressed in dollars 
the majority of the dismantlement costs are not considered aros 
fpl accrues for interim removal costs over the life of the related assets based on depreciation studies approved by the fpsc 
any differences between the aro amount recorded and the amount recorded for ratemaking purposes are reported as a regulatory liability in accordance with regulatory accounting 

table of contents neer neer records a liability for the present value of its expected decommissioning costs which is determined using various internal and external data and applying a probability percentage to a variety of scenarios regarding the life of the plant and timing of decommissioning 
the liability is being accreted using the interest method through the date decommissioning activities are expected to be complete 
at december   the aro for nuclear decommissioning of neer s nuclear plants totaled approximately million 
neer s portion of the ultimate cost of decommissioning its nuclear plants  including costs associated with spent fuel storage above what is expected to be refunded by the doe under the spent fuel settlement agreement  is estimated to be approximately billion  or billion expressed in dollars

all regulatory assets and liabilities are included in rate base or otherwise earn pay a return on investment during the recovery period 
assumptions and accounting approach accounting guidance allows regulators to create assets and impose liabilities that would not be recorded by non rate regulated entities 
if fpl were no longer subject to cost based rate regulation  the existing regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off unless regulators specify an alternative means of recovery or refund 
in addition  the fpsc has the authority to disallow recovery of costs that it considers excessive or imprudently incurred 
such costs may include  among others  fuel and o m expenses  the cost of replacing power lost when fossil and nuclear units are unavailable  storm restoration costs and costs associated with the construction or acquisition of new facilities 
the continued applicability of regulatory accounting is assessed at each reporting period 
see note for a discussion of nee s and fpl s other significant accounting policies 
energy marketing and trading and market risk sensitivity nee and fpl are exposed to risks associated with adverse changes in commodity prices  interest rates  equity prices and currency exchange rates 
financial instruments and positions affecting the financial statements of nee and fpl described below are held primarily for purposes other than trading 
market risk is measured as the potential loss in fair value resulting from hypothetical reasonably possible changes in commodity prices  interest rates  equity prices or currency exchange rates over the next year 
management has established risk management policies to monitor and manage such market risks  as well as credit risks 

table of contents commodity price risk nee and fpl use derivative instruments primarily swaps  options  futures and forwards to manage the commodity price risk inherent in the purchase and sale of fuel and electricity 
in addition  nee  through neer  uses derivatives to optimize the value of power generation assets and engages in power and gas marketing and trading activities to take advantage of expected future favorable price movements

the emc and nee s chief executive officer receive periodic updates on market positions and related exposures  credit exposures and overall risk management activities 
nee uses a value at risk var model to measure commodity price market risk in its trading and mark to market portfolios 
the var is the estimated nominal loss of market value based on a one day holding period at a confidence level using historical simulation methodology 
as of december  and  the var figures are as follows trading non qualifying hedges and hedges in oci and fpl cost recovery clauses a total fpl neer nee fpl neer nee fpl neer nee millions december  december  average for the period ended december  a non qualifying hedges are employed to reduce the market risk exposure to physical assets or contracts which are not marked to market 
the var figures for the non qualifying hedges and hedges in oci and fpl cost recovery clauses category do not represent the economic exposure to commodity price movements 
interest rate risk nee and fpl are exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of their respective issuances of debt  investments in special use funds and other investments 
nee and fpl manage their respective interest rate exposure by monitoring current interest rates  entering into interest rate swaps and using a combination of fixed rate and variable rate debt 
interest rate swaps are used to mitigate and adjust interest rate exposure when deemed appropriate based upon market conditions or when required by financing agreements

b based on market prices provided by external sources 
c provided by external sources based on market prices indicative of market conditions 
d modeled internally based on market values using discounted cash flow analysis and credit valuation adjustment 
the special use funds of nee and fpl consist of restricted funds set aside to cover the cost of storm damage for fpl and for the decommissioning of nee s and fpl s nuclear power plants 
a portion of these funds is invested in fixed income debt securities primarily carried at estimated fair value 
at fpl  changes in fair value  including any otti losses  result in a corresponding adjustment to the related liability accounts based on current regulatory treatment 
the changes in fair value of nee s non rate regulated operations result in a corresponding adjustment to oci  except for impairments deemed to be other than temporary  including any credit losses  which are reported in current period earnings 
because the funds set aside by fpl for storm damage could be needed at any time  the related investments are generally more liquid and  therefore  are less sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the nuclear decommissioning funds  in contrast  are generally invested in longer term securities  as decommissioning activities are not scheduled to begin until at least at fpl

based upon a hypothetical decrease in interest rates  which is a reasonable near term market change  the net fair value of nee s net liabilities would increase by approximately  million million for fpl at december  
table of contents equity price risk nee and fpl are exposed to risk resulting from changes in prices for equity securities 
for example  nee s nuclear decommissioning reserve funds include marketable equity securities primarily carried at their market value of approximately  million and  million  million and  million for fpl at december  and  respectively 
at december   a hypothetical decrease in the prices quoted by stock exchanges  which is a reasonable near term market change  would result in a million million for fpl reduction in fair value 
for fpl  a corresponding adjustment would be made to the related liability accounts based on current regulatory treatment  and for nee s non rate regulated operations  a corresponding adjustment would be made to oci to the extent the market value of the securities exceeded amortized cost and to otti loss to the extent the market value is below amortized cost 
currency exchange rate risk at december   with respect to certain debt issuances and borrowings  neech has two cross currency swaps to hedge against currency movements with respect to both interest and principal payments 
at december  and  the fair value of cross currency swaps was approximately million and million  respectively 
credit risk nee and its subsidiaries are also exposed to credit risk through their energy marketing and trading operations 
credit risk is the risk that a financial loss will be incurred if a counterparty to a transaction does not fulfill its financial obligation 
nee manages counterparty credit risk for its subsidiaries with energy marketing and trading operations through established policies  including counterparty credit limits  and in some cases credit enhancements  such as cash prepayments  letters of credit  cash and other collateral and guarantees 
credit risk is also managed through the use of master netting agreements 
nee s credit department monitors current and forward credit exposure to counterparties and their affiliates  both on an individual and an aggregate basis 
for all derivative and contractual transactions  nee s energy marketing and trading operations  which includes fpl s energy marketing and trading division  are exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to these transactions 
some relevant considerations when assessing nee s energy marketing and trading operations credit risk exposure include the following operations are primarily concentrated in the energy industry 
trade receivables and other financial instruments are predominately with energy  utility and financial services related companies  as well as municipalities  cooperatives and other trading companies in the us overall credit risk is managed through established credit policies and is overseen by the emc 
prospective and existing customers are reviewed for creditworthiness based upon established standards  with customers not meeting minimum standards providing various credit enhancements or secured payment terms  such as letters of credit or the posting of margin cash collateral 
master netting agreements are used to offset cash and non cash gains and losses arising from derivative instruments with the same counterparty 
nee s policy is to have master netting agreements in place with significant counterparties 
based on nee s policies and risk exposures related to credit  nee and fpl do not anticipate a material adverse effect on their financial statements as a result of counterparty nonperformance 
as of december   approximately of nee s and of fpl s energy marketing and trading counterparty credit risk exposure is associated with companies that have investment grade credit ratings
