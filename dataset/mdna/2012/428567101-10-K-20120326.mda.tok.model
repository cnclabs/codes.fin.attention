risk factors 
overview hibbett sports  inc operates sporting goods stores in small to mid sized markets  predominantly in the southeast  southwest  mid atlantic and midwest regions of the united states 
we believe hibbett sports stores are typically the primary sporting goods retailers in their markets due to the extensive selection of quality brand name merchandise and a high level of customer service 
as of january   we operated a total of retail stores in states composed of hibbett sports stores  sports additions athletic shoe stores and sports co 
superstore 
our primary retail format and growth vehicle is hibbett sports  a  square foot store located primarily in strip centers  which are usually influenced by a wal mart store 
approximately of our hibbett sports store base is located in strip centers  which includes free standing stores  while approximately of our hibbett sports store base is located in enclosed malls 
over the last several years  we have concentrated and expect to continue our store base growth in strip centers versus enclosed malls 
we do not expect that the average size of our stores opening in fiscal will vary significantly from the average size of stores opened in fiscal the volatile global economic conditions experienced in fiscal improved somewhat in fiscal and fiscal  and we saw an increase in comparable store and total net sales 
we were able to further enhance net income through continued effective management of expenses 
in fiscal and fiscal  footwear and apparel experienced strong comparable store sales gains 
in fiscal  footwear and apparel experienced mid single digit comparable store sales increases 
apparel sales were led by double digit gains in activewear 
we historically have increases in comparable store net sales in the low to mid single digit range 
fiscal experienced a total company wide square footage increase of 
our plan for fiscal is to increase total company wide square footage over  which is at the lower end of our historical range of to but an improvement from the last two fiscal year square footage increases 
to supplement new store openings  we continue to expand high performing stores  increasing the square footage in existing stores in fiscal generally  our expansions involve an increase in square footage of to 
we expect to expand an additional stores in fiscal total comparable store sales percentage growth is expected to be in the low to mid single digits in fiscal over the past several years  we have increased our gross profit through improved vendor discounts  fewer retail price reductions and increased efficiencies in logistics 
we expect an improvement in gross profit rate in fiscal as we continue to benefit from improved inventory age year over year and increased efficiencies from our investment in systems 
in fiscal  we began an active search for a new distribution facility or site to support our expected growth over the next several years with an expected operations date in mid fiscal we plan to build and own our new facility versus lease and expect that the new facility will cost approximately million 
although the macroeconomic environment has presented many challenges in the last three years  our management believes that our business fundamentals remain strong and that we are well positioned for the future 
we are a leader in the markets in which we compete and we will continue to benefit from our comparatively low operating costs compared to the costs of our competitors 
we continue to manage our costs and inventories prudently as dictated by the current economic environment  and we intend to continue to invest in initiatives to prepare our infrastructure for continued long term growth 
our management expects that the uncertainty and volatility of global economic conditions experienced over the last three years will continue 
any further negative impact on customer discretionary spending could negatively impact our net sales and level of profitability in fiscal due to our increased net sales  we have historically leveraged our store operating  selling and administrative expenses 
based on projected net sales  we expect operating  selling and administrative rates to increase slightly in fiscal  primarily due to investments in technology 
we also expect to continue to generate sufficient cash to enable us to expand and remodel our store base  to provide capital expenditures for both distribution center and technology upgrade projects and to repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase program 
we utilize a merchandise management system that allows us to identify and monitor trends 
however  this system does not produce us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap financial information by product category 
therefore  it is impracticable to provide us gaap net sales by product category 
hibbett operates on a or week fiscal year ending on the saturday nearest to january of each year 
the consolidated statements of operations for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal included weeks of operations 
fiscal will include weeks of operations 
we have operated as a public company and have been incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware since october  comparable store net sales data for the periods presented reflects sales for our traditional format hibbett sports and sports additions stores open throughout the period and the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year 
if a store remodel  relocation or expansion results in the store being closed for a significant period of time  its sales are removed from the comparable store base until it has been open a full months 
our sports co 
store is not and has never been included in the comparable store net sales comparison because we have not opened a superstore since september and we do not have plans to open additional superstores in the future 
executive summary following is a highlight of our financial results over the last three fiscal years fiscal fiscal fiscal net sales in millions operating income  percentage to net sales comparable store sales increase net income in millions net income  percentage increase diluted earnings per share during fiscal  hibbett opened new stores and closed underperforming stores  bringing the store base to in states as of january  inventory on a per store basis at january  increased by  however  there was an improvement in aged merchandise compared to january  hibbett ended the fiscal year with million of available cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheet and full availability under its million unsecured credit facilities

fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal furthermore we opened hibbett sports stores and sports addition stores while closing underperforming hibbett sports stores and sports co 
stores for net stores opened of stores in fiscal we expanded or remodeled high performing stores and converted sports co 
store to a hibbett sports store 
new stores and stores not in the comparable store net sales calculation accounted for million of the increase in net sales 
store openings and closings are reported net of relocations 
we experienced a increase in comparable store net sales for fiscal compared to fiscal higher comparable store net sales contributed million to the increase in net sales 
during fiscal  stores were included in the comparable store sales comparison 
the increase in comparable store net sales was broad based with strong performances across footwear  equipment  apparel and accessories 
strong product performances were led by positive trends in all categories of activewear and in accessories  footwear  and licensed apparel 
lightweight running shoes continue to be a key driver in our footwear business while kid s footwear was particularly strong in fiscal the majority of our comparable store sales increase was from increased consumer traffic and somewhat from increased retail prices 
strip locations continue to outperform enclosed mall stores 
strip center locations now comprise approximately of our total store base and include free standing store locations 
gross profit 
cost of goods sold includes the cost of inventory  occupancy costs for stores and occupancy and operating costs for the distribution center 
gross profit was million  or of net sales  in fiscal  compared with million  or of net sales  in fiscal gross profit percentage was impacted by a higher percentage of merchandise sold at regular price and fewer company wide promotions 
gross profit percentage also benefited from an improvement in inventory shrinkage year over year 
strong sales performance and improved aged inventory negated the need for liquidating promotions and more favorable discounts from vendors resulted in higher initial sell through of inventory at regular prices 
as more of our technology investments for inventory management are implemented  we expect to continue to see improvement in our gross profit percentage 
distribution expense as a percentage of net sales increased basis points resulting primarily from increases in data processing third party services 
in fiscal  we initiated broadband service in over of our existing stores 
we also experienced an increase in freight costs due to higher gas prices 
we expect to see increases in this expense line into fiscal based on the current volatility in the oil markets and unrest in the middle east 
store occupancy expense as a percentage of net sales decreased basis points 
the largest decrease as a percent to net sales was rent expense as we continue to experience rent savings through lease renegotiations and from co tenancy violations by our landlords  offset somewhat by a decrease in construction allowances used to offset rent expense 
we believe we are a valued tenant for our landlords  which enhances our ability to renegotiate lease terms at renewal  and we have had success over the last few years in doing so as our landlords are struggling to keep their properties occupied 
we expect to continue to experience rent savings through lease renegotiations into fiscal store operating  selling and administrative expenses 
store operating  selling and administrative expenses were million  or of net sales  for fiscal  compared with million  or of net sales  for fiscal expense trends we experienced included salary and benefit costs in our stores remained relatively constant as a percentage of net sales  but increased in dollars  primarily from annual pay rate increases and incentive payments associated with higher sales as well as with the growth in stores 
as our store base grows  we expect an increase in salary and benefit dollars  but believe these costs as a percentage to net sales will remain relatively stable 
salary and benefit costs decreased at the administrative level by basis points as a percentage of net sales primarily due to a decrease in the accrual for annual bonuses and a decrease in hospital insurance resulting from lower claims 
we expect hospital insurance costs will increase in fiscal business insurance was lower due to lower actual claims and a decrease in casualty and workers compensation insurance premium expense 
recent trends of increasing credit card processing fees slowed this year as we realized the benefit of lower debit card processing exchange rates 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal  and in fiscal the average lease term of new store leases added in fiscal compared to those added in fiscal increased to years compared to years  respectively  as the result of the execution of more leases with longer initial lease terms in fiscal compared to fiscal we attribute the decrease in depreciation expense as a percent of net sales to a decrease in the investment in leasehold improvements in recent years as more of the build out work is being done by landlords offset somewhat by changes in estimates of useful lives of leasehold improvements in some underperforming stores 
provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal  compared to for fiscal this increase was primarily due to operating efficiencies achieved resulting in higher pre tax income as a percentage of net sales 
the combined federal  state and local effective income tax rate as a percentage of pre tax income was for fiscal and for fiscal the decrease in rate resulted primarily from an increase in employment related income tax credits and the resolution of an income tax matter with a state taxing authority 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal furthermore we opened hibbett sports stores while closing underperforming hibbett sports stores and sports co 
store for net stores opened of stores in fiscal we expanded or remodeled high performing stores 
new stores and stores not in the comparable store net sales calculation accounted for million of the increase in net sales 
store openings and closings are reported net of relocations 
we experienced a increase in comparable store net sales for fiscal compared to fiscal higher comparable store net sales contributed million to the increase in net sales 
during fiscal  stores were included in the comparable store sales comparison 
the increase in comparable store net sales was broad based with strong performances across footwear  equipment  apparel and accessories 
strong product performances were led by positive trends in accessories  licensed apparel  activewear  all categories of footwear and equipment 
strip locations continue to outperform enclosed mall stores 
strip center locations comprised approximately of our total store base and include free standing store locations 
gross profit 
cost of goods sold included the cost of inventory  occupancy costs for stores and occupancy and operating costs for the distribution center 
gross profit was million  or of net sales  in fiscal  compared with million  or of net sales  in fiscal the increase in gross profit percent was due primarily to a higher percentage of merchandise sold at regular price and fewer promotions 
distribution expense as a percentage of net sales decreased basis points primarily due to basis point decreases in salary and benefit costs compared to a year ago 
store occupancy expense as a percentage of net sales decreased basis points 
the largest decrease was rent expense as a percentage of net sales as we continued to experience rent savings through lease renegotiations and from co tenancy violations by our landlords  offset somewhat by a decrease in construction allowances used to offset rent expense 
store operating  selling and administrative expenses 
store operating  selling and administrative expenses were million  or of net sales  for fiscal  compared with million  or of net sales  for fiscal expense trends we experienced included salary and benefit costs in our stores decreased by basis points as a percentage of net sales  but increased in dollars  primarily from annual pay rate increases and incentive payments associated with higher sales 
these expenses increased at the administrative level by basis points as a percentage of net sales primarily due to increases in accruals for bonuses 
legal fees  business insurance costs and professional fees were lower as we continued to closely monitor and carefully manage these costs 
credit and debit card fees increased as a percent to net sales due to higher exchange rates 
medical insurance costs increased as a result of increased enrollment coupled with a slight increase in actual claims 
third party freight and shipping costs were also higher  primarily due to an increase in the total number of stores serviced 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal  and in fiscal the average lease term of new store leases added in fiscal compared to those added in fiscal increased to years compared to years  respectively  as the result of the execution of more leases with longer initial lease terms in fiscal compared to fiscal we attributed the decrease in depreciation expense as a percent of net sales to a decrease in the investment in leasehold improvements in recent years as more of the build out work was being done by landlords offset somewhat by changes in estimates of useful lives of leasehold improvements in some underperforming stores 
provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal  compared to for fiscal this increase was primarily due to operating efficiencies achieved resulting in higher pre tax income as a percentage of net sales 
the combined federal  state and local effective income tax rate as a percentage of pre tax income was for fiscal and for fiscal this decrease was primarily due to increased stock option exercise activity 
liquidity and capital resources our capital requirements relate primarily to new store openings  stock repurchases and working capital requirements 
our working capital requirements are somewhat seasonal in nature and typically reach their peak near the end of the third and the beginning of the fourth quarters of our fiscal year 
historically  we have funded our cash requirements primarily through our cash flow from operations and occasionally from borrowings under our revolving credit facilities 
due to the low interest rates currently available  we are using excess cash on deposit to offset bank fees versus investing such funds in an equity market or in interest bearing deposits 
our consolidated statements of cash flows are summarized as follows in thousands fiscal year ended january  january  january  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents operating activities 
cash flow from operations is seasonal in our business 
typically  we use cash flow from operations to increase inventory in advance of peak selling seasons  such as winter holidays and back to school 
inventory levels are reduced in connection with higher sales during the peak selling seasons and this inventory reduction  combined with proportionately higher net income  typically produces a positive cash flow 
in recent years  we have experienced a trend of increasing free rent provisions in lieu of cash construction allowances in our leases 
we believe this is primarily the result of the tightening of commercial credit on our landlords 
because of this  the non cash portion of landlord allowances has also experienced increases 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal compared with net cash provided by operating activities of million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the reduction in net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to inventory levels  which have continued to increase year over year as the number of stores have increased  although the inventory per store has historically trended slightly down to flat 
ending inventory at january  was up on a per store level compared to january  due primarily to a shift in product mix in advance of our strong spring selling season this year versus last year and  to a lesser degree  merchandise cost increases 
the increase in inventory used cash of million  million and million during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
although our inventory levels have increased at the store level over the last few years  our aged inventory is down 
the change in accounts payable used cash of million during fiscal and provided cash of million and million during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
beginning in fiscal  we started paying some of our vendors using corporate purchasing cards  which effectively extended our payment terms by one month 
the fluctuation in cash provided by accounts payable between fiscal and fiscal resulted from the anniversary of the payment term extensions 
net income provided cash of million  million and million during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
non cash charges included depreciation and amortization expense of million  million and million during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively  and stock based compensation expense of million  million and million during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the stock based compensation increase resulted from the achievement of psus at greater than their granted level 
investing activities 
cash used in investing activities in the fiscal periods ended january   january  and january  totaled million  million and million  respectively 
gross capital expenditures used million  million and million during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
we use cash in investing activities to build new stores and remodel  expand or relocate existing stores 
we opened new stores and relocated  expanded and or remodeled existing stores during fiscal we opened new stores and relocated  expanded and or remodeled existing stores during fiscal we opened new stores and relocated  expanded and or remodeled existing stores during fiscal furthermore  net cash used in investing activities includes purchases of information technology assets and expenditures for our distribution facility and corporate headquarters 
we estimate the cash outlay for capital expenditures in the fiscal year ending february  will be approximately million  which relates to the opening of approximately new stores  remodeling of selected existing stores  information system upgrades and various improvements at our headquarters and distribution center 
of the total budgeted dollars for capital expenditures for fiscal  we anticipate that approximately will be related to the opening of new stores and remodeling and or relocating existing stores 
approximately will be related to information systems with the remaining related primarily to transportation equipment  automobiles and security equipment for our stores 
in addition  the lease for our existing distribution center expires in december we plan to build and own versus lease our new distribution facility at a cost of approximately million over the next years 
as of january   we had approximately million outlay remaining on enhancements to our merchandising system relating to demand forecasting and markdown optimization 
we believe these enhancements will further advance our ability to improve gross profit across all markets and merchandise by providing another tool for managing our inventory at the store level 
financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities was million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million in fiscal the financing activity cash fluctuation between years is primarily the result of repurchases of our common stock 
we expended million and million on repurchases of our common stock during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
we did not repurchase any of our common stock during fiscal financing activities also consisted of proceeds from stock option exercises and the excess tax benefit from the exercise of incentive stock options 
as stock options are exercised  we will continue to receive proceeds and expect a tax deduction  however  the amounts and timing cannot be predicted 
at january   we had two unsecured revolving credit facilities that allow borrowings up to million and million  respectively  and which renew in august and november  respectively 
the facilities do not require a commitment or agency fee nor are there any covenant restrictions 
we plan to renew these facilities as they expire and do not anticipate any problems in doing so  however  no assurance can be given that we will be granted a renewal or terms which are acceptable to us 
as of january   we did not have any debt outstanding under either of these facilities 
at january   we had two unsecured revolving credit facilities that allowed borrowings up to million and million  respectively  and which renewed in august and november  respectively
