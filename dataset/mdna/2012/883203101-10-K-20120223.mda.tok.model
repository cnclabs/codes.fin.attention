an analysis of our consolidated operating results is provided below and a more detailed analysis of our segments operating results is provided in the segment analysis section on pages to revenues dollars in millions revenues change compared with prior period revenues increased million   in  compared with  primarily due to an increase in manufacturing revenues with increases in the cessna  bell  and industrial segments that were partially offset by lower revenues in the textron systems segment 
the net revenue increase included the following factors higher cessna revenues of million  primarily due to higher volume  largely due to the impact of higher citation jet volume and the mix of light and mid size jets sold during the period  higher bell revenues of million  largely due to higher volume in our military programs  which included more deliveries of v and h aircraft  and increased industrial segment revenues of million  primarily due to higher volume of million  mostly reflecting higher automotive industry demand  and a favorable foreign exchange impact of million  largely related to strengthening of the euro  partially offset by lower revenues at the finance segment of million  primarily attributable to the lower average finance receivable portfolio balance resulting from continued liquidation  and lower textron systems revenues of million  primarily due to million in lower volume in the uas and mission support and other product lines  partially offset by higher volume in the land marine and weapons and sensors product lines of million 
revenues increased million in  compared with this increase was due to significant revenue increases in the industrial  bell and textron systems segments that were largely offset by lower revenues in the cessna and finance segments 
the net revenue increase included the following factors higher revenues of million in the industrial segment  largely due to higher volume reflecting improvements in the automotive industry  higher bell revenues of million  primarily due to higher v and h volume and improved pricing in its commercial business  and increased textron systems revenues of million  primarily due to higher uas volume  partially offset by lower revenues at cessna of million  primarily due to lower citation jet volume  and reduced finance segment revenues of million  largely due to lower average finance receivables resulting from the continued liquidation

changes in operating expenses are more fully discussed in our segment analysis below 
consolidated manufacturing cost of sales as a percentage of manufacturing revenues was and in and  respectively 
on a dollar basis  consolidated cost of sales increased million   in  principally due to higher sales volume in the cessna  bell and industrial segments 
in  gross margin increased as a percentage of revenues primarily due to favorable product mix and improved leverage and manufacturing efficiencies on higher volume at cessna and bell 
these improvements were partially offset by a million increase in engineering and development expenses throughout our manufacturing businesses and million in charges at textron systems related to the impairment of certain intangible assets and severance costs 
in  on a consolidated basis  selling and administrative expense decreased million   to billion  compared with  primarily due to million in lower operating expense at the finance segment  largely reflecting progress towards our exit from the non captive commercial finance business  and a million decrease in corporate expense  primarily due to the impact of changes in our stock price on compensation expense 
these decreases were partially offset by higher bid and proposal costs at textron systems in in and  cost of sales as a percentage of manufacturing revenues remained flat at 
on a dollar basis  cost of sales increased million   in  compared with  principally due to the net sales volume changes in the industrial  bell and cessna segments described above  as well as higher pension costs and inflation 
in  favorable conversion costs in the bell and industrial segments  resulting from improved leverage and manufacturing efficiencies on higher volumes  were offset by increased conversion costs at cessna 
conversion costs increased at cessna as cost reduction activities  including workforce reductions and facility consolidations  did not fully offset the impact of lower production volumes 
in  selling and administrative expense decreased million   to billion  compared with  primarily due to million in lower expenses in the finance segment reflecting lower compensation and related costs due to headcount reductions associated with our exit from the non captive commercial finance business  million of lower commissions primarily resulting from lower cessna sales volume  and million lower corporate expenses

valuation allowance on transfer of golf mortgage portfolio to held for sale on a periodic basis  we evaluate our liquidation strategy for the non captive finance portfolios as we continue to execute our exit plan 
in connection with this evaluation  we also review our definition of the foreseeable future 
due to the relative stability of the golf market through the end of  we believe that the foreseeable future now can be extended to a period of one to two years as opposed to the six to nine month period we previously used 
based on this change  in the fourth quarter of  we determined that we no longer had the intent to hold the remaining golf mortgage portfolio for investment for the foreseeable future  and  accordingly  transferred million of the remaining golf mortgage finance receivables  net of an million allowance for loan losses  from the held for investment classification to the held for sale classification 
these finance receivables were recorded at fair value at the time of the transfer  resulting in a million charge recorded to valuation allowance on transfer of golf mortgage portfolio to held for sale 
special charges there were no amounts recorded within special charges in in and  special charges included restructuring charges related to a global restructuring program that totaled million and million  respectively  primarily related to severance costs and asset impairment charges 
in the fourth quarter of  we initiated a restructuring program to reduce overhead costs and improve productivity across the company and announced the exit of portions of our commercial finance business 
this restructuring program primarily included corporate and segment direct and indirect workforce reductions and the closure and consolidation of certain operations throughout the company 
in the fourth quarter of  we initiated the final series of restructuring actions under this program  which included workforce reductions in the bell  textron systems and industrial segments and at corporate  along with the decision to exit a plant in the industrial segment 
upon the completion of this program at the end of  we had terminated approximately  positions worldwide representing approximately of our global workforce since the inception of the program and had exited leased and owned facilities and plants

table of contents segment analysis we operate in  and report financial information for  the following five business segments cessna  bell  textron systems  industrial and finance 
segment profit is an important measure used for evaluating performance and for decision making purposes 
segment profit for the manufacturing segments excludes interest expense  certain corporate expenses and special charges 
the measurement for the finance segment excludes special charges and includes interest income and expense along with intercompany interest expense 
in our discussion of comparative results for the manufacturing group  changes in revenue and segment profit typically are expressed for our commercial business in terms of volume  pricing  foreign exchange and acquisitions 
additionally  changes in segment profit may be expressed in terms of mix  inflation and cost performance 
volume changes in revenue represent increases decreases in the number of units delivered or services provided 
pricing represents changes in unit pricing 
foreign exchange is the change resulting from translating foreign denominated amounts into us dollars at exchange rates that are different from the prior period 
acquisitions refer to the results generated from businesses that were acquired within the previous months 
for segment profit  mix represents a change due to the composition of products and or services sold at different profit margins 
inflation represents higher material  wages  benefits  pension or other costs 
cost performance reflects an increase or decrease in research and development  depreciation  selling and administrative costs  warranty  product liability  quality scrap  labor efficiency  overhead  product line profitability  start up  ramp up and cost reduction initiatives or other manufacturing inputs 
approximately of our revenues were derived from contracts with the us government 
for our segments that have significant contracts with the us government  we typically express changes in segment profit related to the government business in terms of volume  changes in program performance or changes in contract mix 
changes in volume that are discussed in net sales typically drive corresponding changes in our segment profit based on the profit rate for a particular contract 
changes in program performance typically relate to profit recognition associated with revisions to total estimated costs at completion that reflect improved or deteriorated operating performance or award fee rates 
changes in contract mix refers to changes in operating margin due to a change in the relative volume of contracts with higher or lower fee rates such that the overall average margin rate for the segment changes

liquidity and capital resources our financings are conducted through two separate borrowing groups 
the manufacturing group consists of textron inc consolidated with its majority owned subsidiaries that operate in the cessna  bell  textron systems and industrial segments 
the finance group  which also is the finance segment  consists of tfc  its consolidated subsidiaries and three other finance subsidiaries owned by textron inc we designed this framework to enhance our borrowing power by separating the finance group 
our manufacturing group operations include the development  production and delivery of tangible goods and services  while our finance group provides financial services 
due to the fundamental differences between each borrowing group s activities  investors  rating agencies and analysts use different measures to evaluate each group s performance 
to support those evaluations  we present balance sheet and cash flow information for each borrowing group within the consolidated financial statements 
key information that is utilized in assessing our liquidity is summarized below in millions december  january  manufacturing group cash and equivalents debt shareholders equity capital debt plus shareholders equity net debt net of cash and equivalents to capital debt to capital finance group cash and equivalents debt we believe that our calculations of debt to capital and net debt to capital are useful measures as they provide a summary indication of the level of debt financing ie  leverage that is in place to support our capital structure  as well as to provide an indication of the capacity to add further leverage 
we believe that with our existing cash and equivalents  along with the cash we expect to generate from our manufacturing operations  we will have sufficient cash to meet our future needs 
in  textron inc entered into a senior unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in march for an aggregate principal amount of billion  up to million of which is available for the issuance of letters of credit 
at december   there were no amounts borrowed against the facility  and there were million of letters of credits issued against it 
we maintain an effective shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission that allows us to issue an unlimited amount of public debt and other securities 
in september  we issued million in notes due and million in notes due under this registration statement 

table of contents in september  we announced a cash tender offer for any and all of the outstanding convertible notes 
in accordance with the terms of the tender offer  for each  principal amount of the convertible notes tendered  we paid the holder  plus accrued and unpaid interest up to the october  settlement date 
in the aggregate  the holders validly tendered million principal amount  or  of the convertible notes 
subsequent to the tender offer  we also purchased million principal amount of the convertible notes in a small number of privately negotiated transactions and retired another million related to a holder initiated conversion in the fourth quarter of by the end of  we had paid approximately million in cash related to these transactions and had reduced the principal amount of the convertible notes by 
at december   million principal amount of convertible notes were outstanding 
for at least trading days during the consecutive trading days ended december   our common stock price exceeded the conversion threshold price for the convertible notes of per share 
accordingly  the remaining notes are convertible at the holder s option through march  we may deliver shares of common stock  cash or a combination of cash and shares of common stock in satisfaction of our obligations upon conversion of the convertible notes 
we intend to settle the face value of the convertible notes in cash 
we have continued to classify these convertible notes as long term based on our intent and ability to maintain the debt outstanding for at least one year through the use of various funding sources available to us 
during  we reduced our total finance receivable portfolio by billion primarily through liquidations  mark to market adjustments on certain portfolios and impairments 
these finance receivable reductions occurred in both the non captive and captive finance portfolios  but were primarily driven by the non captive portfolio in connection with our exit plan  including million and million in the timeshare and golf mortgage product lines  respectively 
depending on market conditions  we expect continued progress in liquidating the remaining million in the non captive portfolio over the next several years 
manufacturing group cash flows cash flows from continuing operations for the manufacturing group as presented in our consolidated statement of cash flows are summarized below in millions operating activities investing activities financing activities cash flows from operating activities increased in  compared with  primarily due to higher earnings for the manufacturing group

captive financing and other intercompany transactions the finance group finances retail purchases and leases for new and used aircraft and equipment manufactured by our manufacturing group  otherwise known as captive financing 
in the consolidated statements of cash flows  cash received from customers or from the sale of receivables is reflected as operating activities when received from third parties 
however  in the cash flow information provided for the separate borrowing groups  cash flows related to captive financing activities are reflected based on the operations of each group 
for example  when product is sold by our manufacturing group to a customer and is financed by the finance group  the origination of the finance receivable is recorded within investing activities as a cash outflow in the finance group s statement of cash flows 
meanwhile  in the manufacturing group s statement of cash flows  the cash received from the finance group on the customer s behalf is recorded within operating cash flows as a cash inflow 
although cash is transferred between the two borrowing groups  there is no cash transaction reported in the consolidated cash flows at the time of the original financing 
these captive financing activities  along with all significant intercompany transactions  are reclassified or eliminated from the consolidated statements of cash flows 
reclassification and elimination adjustments included in the consolidated statement of cash flows are summarized below in millions reclassifications from investing activities finance receivable originations for manufacturing group inventory sales cash received from customers and the sale of receivables other capital contributions made to finance group other total reclassifications from investing activities reclassifications from financing activities capital contribution paid by manufacturing group to finance group under support agreement dividends received by manufacturing group from finance group other capital contributions made to finance group other total reclassifications from financing activities total reclassifications and adjustments to cash flow from operating activities consolidated discontinued operations cash flows cash flows from discontinued operations in primarily include approximately million in after tax net proceeds upon the sale of hr textron  partially offset by million in tax payments related to the sale of the fluid power business

table of contents contractual obligations manufacturing group the following table summarizes the known contractual obligations  as defined by reporting regulations  of our manufacturing group as of december  payments due by period in millions total less than year years years more than years liabilities reflected in balance sheet long term debt interest on borrowings pension benefits for unfunded plans postretirement benefits other than pensions other long term liabilities liabilities not reflected in balance sheet operating leases purchase obligations total manufacturing group we maintain defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans other than pensions as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
included in the above table are discounted estimated benefit payments we expect to make related to unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
actual benefit payments are dependent on a number of factors  including mortality assumptions  expected retirement age  rate of compensation increases and medical trend rates  which are subject to change in future years 
our policy for funding pension plans is to make contributions annually  consistent with applicable laws and regulations  however  future contributions to our pension plans are not included in the above table 
in  we expect to make contributions to our funded pension plans of approximately million and approximately million in the retirement account plan 
based on our current assumptions  which may change with changes in market conditions  our current contribution estimates for each of the years from through are estimated to be in the range of approximately million to million under the plan provisions in place at this time 
other long term liabilities included in the table consist primarily of undiscounted amounts in the consolidated balance sheet as of december   representing obligations under deferred compensation arrangements and estimated environmental remediation costs 
payments under deferred compensation arrangements have been estimated based on management s assumptions of expected retirement age  mortality  stock price and rates of return on participant deferrals 
the timing of cash flows associated with environmental remediation costs is largely based on historical experience 
other long term liabilities  such as deferred taxes  unrecognized tax benefits and product liability and litigation reserves  have been excluded from the table due to the uncertainty of the timing of payments combined with the absence of historical trends to be used as a predictor for such payments 
operating leases represent undiscounted obligations under noncancelable leases 
purchase obligations include undiscounted amounts committed under legally enforceable contracts or purchase orders for goods and services with defined terms as to price  quantity and delivery dates 
approximately of the purchase obligations we disclose represent purchase orders issued for goods and services to be delivered under firm contracts with the us government for which we have full recourse under customary contract termination clauses

interest payments reflect the current interest rate paid on the related debt 
they do not include anticipated changes in market interest rates  which could have an impact on the interest rate according to the terms of the related debt 
on december   the finance group also had million in other liabilities  primarily accounts payable and accrued expenses  that are payable within the next months 
critical accounting estimates to prepare our consolidated financial statements to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  we must make complex and subjective judgments in the selection and application of accounting policies 
the accounting policies that we believe are most critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations are listed below 
we believe these policies require our most difficult  subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties 
this section should be read in conjunction with note to the consolidated financial statements  which includes other significant accounting policies 
allowance for losses on finance receivables held for investment finance receivables held for investment are generally recorded at the amount of outstanding principal less allowance for losses 
we maintain the allowance for losses on finance receivables at a level considered adequate to cover inherent losses in the portfolio based on management s evaluation and analysis by product line 
for larger balance accounts specifically identified as impaired  including large accounts in homogeneous portfolios  a reserve is established based on comparing the carrying value with either a the expected future cash flows  discounted at the finance receivable s effective interest rate  or b the fair value  if the finance receivable is collateral dependent 
the expected future cash flows consider collateral value  financial performance and liquidity of our borrower  existence and financial strength of guarantors  estimated recovery costs  including legal expenses  and costs associated with the repossession foreclosure and eventual disposal of collateral 
when there is a range of potential outcomes  we perform multiple discounted cash flow analyses and weight the outcomes based on their relative likelihood of occurrence 
the evaluation of our portfolios is inherently subjective  as it requires estimates  including the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired finance receivables and the underlying collateral  which may differ from actual results 
while our analysis is specific to each individual account  certain critical factors are included in this analysis for each product line  which are discussed in detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we also establish an allowance for losses by product line to cover probable but specifically unknown losses existing in the portfolio 
for homogeneous portfolios  including aviation and golf equipment  the allowance is established as a percentage of non recourse finance receivables  which have not been identified as requiring specific reserves 
the percentage is based on a combination of factors including historical loss experience  current delinquency and default trends  collateral values and both general economic and specific industry trends 
for non homogeneous portfolios  such as timeshare  the allowance is established as a percentage of watchlist balances  which represents a combination of assumed default likelihood and loss severity based on historical experience  industry trends and collateral values 
we classify accounts as watchlist based on credit quality indicators discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents finance receivables finance receivables are classified as held for investment when we have the intent and the ability to hold the receivable for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff 
our decision to classify certain finance receivables as held for sale is based on a number of factors  including  but not limited to  contractual duration  type of collateral  credit strength of the borrowers  interest rates and perceived marketability of the receivables 
on an ongoing basis  these factors  combined with our overall liquidation strategy  determine which finance receivables we have the intent to hold for the foreseeable future and which finance receivables we will hold for sale 
our current strategy is based on an evaluation of both our performance and liquidity position and changes in external factors affecting the value and or marketability of our finance receivables 
a change in this strategy could result in a change in the classification of our finance receivables 
if we determine that finance receivables classified as held for sale will not be sold and we have the intent and ability to hold the finance receivables for the foreseeable future  until maturity or payoff  the finance receivables are transferred to held for investment at the lower of cost or fair value at that time 
conversely  if we determine that there are other finance receivables that we subsequently determine we no longer intend or have the ability to hold to maturity  these receivables would be designated as held for sale  and a valuation allowance would be established at that time  if necessary 
at december   if we had classified additional finance receivables as held for sale  a valuation allowance would likely have been required at that time based on the fair value estimates we completed for our footnote disclosure requirements 
see page in note to the consolidated financial statements for a table where we have included the carrying value and fair value for the finance receivables held for investment  excluding leases that currently are not recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet 
finance receivables held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value 
there are no active  quoted market prices for our finance receivables 
the estimate of fair value was determined based on the use of discounted cash flow models to estimate the exit price we expect to receive in the principal market for each type of loan in an orderly transaction  which includes both the sale of pools of similar assets and the sale of individual loans 
the models we used incorporate estimates of the rate of return  financing cost  capital structure and or discount rate expectations of current market participants combined with estimated loan cash flows based on credit losses  payment rates and expectations of borrowers ability to make scheduled balloon payments on a timely basis 
where available  assumptions related to the expectations of current market participants are compared with observable market inputs  including bids from prospective purchasers of similar loans and certain bond market indices for loans perceived to be of similar credit quality 
although we utilize and prioritize these market observable inputs in our discounted cash flow models  these inputs are not typically derived from markets with directly comparable loan structures  industries and collateral types 
therefore  all valuations of finance receivables held for sale involve significant management judgment  which can result in differences between our fair value estimates and those of other market participants 
see page in note to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of changes in fair value and the classification of finance receivables for the past two years 
long term contracts we make a substantial portion of our sales to government customers pursuant to long term contracts 
these contracts require development and delivery of products over multiple years and may contain fixed price purchase options for additional products 
we account for these long term contracts under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
under this method  we estimate profit as the difference between total estimated revenues and cost of a contract 
the percentage of completion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion and  in some cases  includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications 
due to the size  length of time and nature of many of our contracts  the estimation of total contract costs and revenues through completion is complicated and subject to many variables relative to the outcome of future events over a period of several years 
we are required to make numerous assumptions and estimates relating to items such as expected engineering requirements  complexity of design and related development costs  performance of subcontractors  availability and cost of materials  labor productivity and cost  overhead and capital costs  manufacturing efficiencies and the achievement of contract milestones  including product deliveries 
our cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge and experience of engineers and program managers along with finance professionals 
we update our projections of costs at least semiannually or when circumstances significantly change 
adjustments to projected costs are recognized in earnings when determinable 
anticipated losses on contracts are recognized in full in the period in which the losses become probable and estimable 
due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above  it is likely that materially different revenues and or cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change 
our earnings could be reduced by a material amount resulting in a charge to earnings if a total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than expected due to changes in customer specifications prior to contract amendment  b total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than previously estimated due to cost overruns or inflation  c there is a change in engineering efforts required during the development stage of the contract or d we are unable to meet contract milestones 

table of contents at the outset of each contract  we estimate the initial profit booking rate 
the initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements for example  a newly developed product versus a mature product  schedule for example  the number and type of milestone events  and costs by contract requirements in the initial estimated costs at completion 
profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical  schedule  and costs aspects of the contract 
likewise  the profit booking rate may decrease if we are not successful in retiring the risks  and  as a result  our estimated costs at completion increase 
all of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and  therefore  may affect the profit booking rate 
when adjustments are required  any changes from prior estimates are recognized using the cumulative catch up method with the impact of the change from inception to date recorded in the current period 
the following table sets forth the aggregate gross amount of all program profit adjustments that are included within segment profit for the two years ended december  in millions gross favorable gross unfavorable net adjustments goodwill we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances  such as declines in sales  earnings or cash flows  or material adverse changes in the business climate  indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit might be impaired 
the reporting unit represents the operating segment unless discrete financial information is prepared and reviewed by segment management for businesses one level below that operating segment  in which case such component is the reporting unit 
in certain instances  we have aggregated components of an operating segment into a single reporting unit based on similar economic characteristics 
in september  the financial accounting standards board issued guidance that permits companies to perform a qualitative assessment based on economic  industry and company specific factors as the initial step in the annual goodwill impairment test for all or selected reporting units 
based on the results of the qualitative assessment  companies are only required to perform step of the annual impairment test for a reporting unit if the company concludes that it is more likely than not that the unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount 
as permitted  we adopted this guidance in the fourth quarter of to reduce the costs associated with determining each reporting unit s fair value for the units where it is more likely than not that the fair value exceeds its carrying amount 
for the reporting units for which we did not elect to perform a qualitative assessment  we performed a step analysis  which required us to calculate fair value of each reporting unit 
if the reporting unit s estimated fair value exceeds its carrying value  the reporting unit is not impaired  and no further analysis is performed 
otherwise  the amount of the impairment must be determined in step of the goodwill impairment test 
in step  the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by assigning a fair value to all of the reporting unit s assets and liabilities  including any unrecognized intangible assets  as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination at fair value 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
fair values are established primarily using discounted cash flows that incorporate assumptions for the unit s short and long term revenue growth rates  operating margins and discount rates  which represent our best estimates of current and forecasted market conditions  current cost structure  anticipated net cost reductions  and the implied rate of return that we believe a market participant would require for an investment in a company having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed 
the revenue growth rates and operating margins used in our discounted cash flow analysis are based on our businesses strategic plans and long range planning forecasts 
the long term growth rate we use to determine the terminal value of the business is based on our assessment of its minimum expected terminal growth rate  as well as its past historical growth and broader economic considerations such as gross domestic product  inflation and the maturity of the markets we serve 
we utilize a weighted average cost of capital in our impairment analysis that makes assumptions about the capital structure that we believe a market participant would make and include a risk premium based on an assessment of risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit 
we believe this approach yields a discount rate that is consistent with an implied rate of return that an independent investor or market participant would require for an investment in a company having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed 
based on our annual review  the fair value of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values  and we do not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that any units might fail the step impairment test in the foreseeable future 

table of contents retirement benefits we maintain various pension and postretirement plans for our employees globally 
these plans include significant pension and postretirement benefit obligations  which are calculated based on actuarial valuations 
key assumptions used in determining these obligations and related expenses include expected long term rates of return on plan assets  discount rates and healthcare cost projections 
we also make assumptions regarding employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns  mortality  turnover and rate of compensation increases 
we evaluate and update these assumptions annually 
to determine the weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets  we consider the current and expected asset allocation  as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class 
a lower expected rate of return on plan assets will increase pension expense 
for  the assumed expected long term rate of return on plan assets used in calculating pension expense was  compared with in in and  the assumed rate of return for our domestic plans  which represent approximately of our total pension assets  was and  respectively 
a basis point decrease in this long term rate of return in would have increased pension expense for our domestic plans by approximately million 
the discount rate enables us to state expected future benefit payments as a present value on the measurement date  reflecting the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled 
this rate should be in line with rates for high quality fixed income investments available for the period to maturity of the pension benefits  which fluctuate as long term interest rates change 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of the benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
in  the weighted average discount rate used in calculating pension expense was  compared with in for our domestic plans  the assumed discount rate was in  compared with for a basis point decrease in this discount rate in would have increased pension expense for our domestic plans by approximately million 
the trend in healthcare costs is difficult to estimate  and it has an important effect on postretirement liabilities 
the medical and prescription drug healthcare cost trend rates represent the weighted average annual projected rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits 
the medical rate of is assumed to decrease to by and then remain at that level 
the prescription drug rate of is assumed to decrease to by and then remain at that level 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of a one percentage point change in the cost trend rate 
warranty liabilities we provide limited warranty and product maintenance programs  including parts and labor  for certain products for periods ranging from one to five years 
a significant portion of these liabilities arises from our commercial aircraft businesses 
we also may incur costs related to product recalls 
we estimate the costs that may be incurred under warranty programs and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized 
factors that affect this liability include the number of products sold  historical costs per claim  contractual recoveries from vendors  and historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims  including production and warranty patterns for new models 
during our initial aircraft model launches  we typically incur higher warranty related costs until the production process matures  at which point warranty costs moderate 
we assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty and product maintenance liabilities periodically and adjust the amounts as necessary 
adjustments are made to accruals as claim data and actual experience warrant 
should future warranty experience differ materially from our historical experience  we may be required to record additional warranty liabilities  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in the period in which these additional liabilities are required 
income taxes deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases  as well as from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards  and are stated at enacted tax rates in effect for the year taxes are expected to be paid or recovered 
deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years 
we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources  including the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences  taxable income in carryback years  available tax planning strategies and estimated future taxable income 
we recognize net tax related interest and penalties for continuing operations in income tax expense 
the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  which may result in proposed assessments 
our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental 
we assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts  circumstances and information available at the reporting date 
for those tax positions for which it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  we record the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
interest and penalties are accrued  where applicable 
we recognize net tax related interest and penalties for continuing operations in income tax expense 
if we do not believe that it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  no tax benefit is recognized 
however  our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities due to settlement of income tax examinations  
table of contents new regulatory or judicial pronouncements  or other relevant events 
as a result  our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly and annual basis

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risks our financial results are affected by changes in the us and foreign interest rates 
as part of managing this risk  we seek to achieve a prudent balance between floating and fixed rate exposures 
we continually monitor our mix of these exposures and adjust the mix  as necessary 
for our finance group  we limit our risk to changes in interest rates for the captive business with a strategy of matching floating rate assets with floating rate liabilities  which includes the use of interest rate exchange agreements 
foreign exchange risks our financial results are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates in the various countries in which our products are manufactured and or sold 
for our manufacturing operations  we manage exposures to foreign currency assets and earnings primarily by funding certain foreign currency denominated assets with liabilities in the same currency so that certain exposures are naturally offset 
we primarily use borrowings denominated in euro and british pound sterling for these purposes 
in managing our foreign currency transaction exposures  we also enter into foreign currency forward exchange and option contracts 
these contracts generally are used to fix the local currency cost of purchased goods or services or selling prices denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 
the notional amount of outstanding foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency options was approximately billion at the end of and the impact of foreign exchange rate changes for and from the prior year for each period is provided below in millions impact of foreign exchange rates increased decreased revenues segment profit quantitative risk measures in the normal course of business  we enter into financial instruments for purposes other than trading 
to quantify the market risk inherent in our financial instruments  we utilize a sensitivity analysis 
the financial instruments that are subject to market risk interest rate risk  foreign exchange rate risk and equity price risk include finance receivables excluding lease receivables  debt excluding lease obligations  interest rate exchange agreements and foreign currency exchange contracts
