readers are cautioned that such forward looking statements should be read in conjunction with our disclosures under the heading risk factors beginning on page financial condition and results of operations comparison of twelve months ended december   and production and production costs 
our uranium production was zero in both and and totaled  pounds in in and we saw a decline in vasquez production and the start up of production from our kingsville dome project 
the vasquez project was mined out in and existing wellfields at kingsville dome completed production in the second quarter of production at our rosita project was suspended in october because of high cost of production combined with lower uranium prices 
although technically challenging  we believe the reserves from rosita can be produced economically with higher uranium prices 
we completed production at the vasquez project in the fourth quarter of and we shut in production at the kingsville dome project in the second quarter of the vasquez project is now being restored 
at the kingsville dome and rosita projects  we shut in production to conserve the in place reserve base in response to a drop in uranium market prices 
we do not intend to resume production at these sites until there is a significant recovery of uranium prices 

table of contents the following table details our production and production cost breakdown for the year ended december   and kingsville dome production vasquez production rosita production total production total operating costs per pound operating costs n a n a total depreciation and depletion costs per pound dd a cost n a n a total production cost production cost per pound n a n a total operating costs  total depreciation and depletion costs and total production costs incurred for the periods presented above differ from the cost of uranium sales recorded in consolidated statements of operations because of changes in the amounts recorded to inventory for the same periods 
the cost of uranium sales include the sales of uranium inventory on hand at the beginning of the period and do not include uranium produced during the period but not sold at period end 
the following table provides a reconciliation of production costs to cost of uranium sales for the year ended december   and operating costs change in uranium inventory operating expense for uranium production sold depreciation and depletion costs change in uranium inventory depreciation and depletion for uranium production sold total production costs change in uranium inventory direct cost of uranium production sold the costs incurred in and for operations and depreciation depletion resulted from stand by  maintenance and monitoring activities at our rosita and kingsville dome projects 
total expenditures for direct production costs in were significantly lower than as a result of the scale back of production during the year when compared to the reduced production in resulted from the decline in uranium prices throughout which led to the company s decision in october to defer new wellfield development

the value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the input of subjective assumptions  including the expected term of the option award and stock price volatility 
the expected term of options granted was derived from historical data on our employee exercise and post vesting employment termination experience

table of contents critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements on page f of this form k 
we believe our most critical accounting policies involve those requiring the use of significant estimates and assumptions in determining values or projecting future costs 
specifically regarding our uranium properties  significant estimates were utilized in determining the carrying value of these assets 
these assets have been recorded at their estimated net realizable value for impairment purposes  which is less than our cost 
the actual value realized from these assets may vary significantly from these estimates based upon market conditions  financing availability and other factors 
regarding our reserve for future restoration and reclamation costs  significant estimates were utilized in determining the future costs to complete the groundwater restoration and surface reclamation at our mine sites 
the actual cost to conduct these activities may vary significantly from these estimates 
such estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period 
the accounts of the company are maintained in united states dollars 
all dollar amounts in the financial statements are stated in united states dollars except where indicated 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk uranium price volatility the company is subject to market risk related to the market price of uranium 
we have two uranium supply contracts whose pricing mechanisms are based upon the market price of uranium 
future sales under these contracts would be impacted by both spot and long term uranium price fluctuations 
the company s cash flow has historically been dependent on the price of uranium  which is determined primarily by global supply and demand  relative to the company s costs of production 
historically  uranium prices have been subject to fluctuation  and the price of uranium has been and will continue to be affected by numerous factors beyond the company s control  including the demand for nuclear power  political and economic conditions  and governmental legislation in uranium producing and consuming countries and production levels and costs of production of other producing companies 
the spot market price for uranium has demonstrated a large range since january prices have risen from per pound at january to a high of per pound as of june the spot market price was per pound as of february
