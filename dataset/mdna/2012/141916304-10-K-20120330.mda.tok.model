critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements included under item in this report have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with gaap requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and their accompanying notes 
we have identified certain policies such as derivative liabilities and stock option compensation expense that are calculated using the binomial and black scholes option model that we believe are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
these policies require the application of significant estimates and judgment by our management 
we base our estimates on our historical experience  industry standards  and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an adverse effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  and results of operations could occur if circumstances change that alter the various assumptions or conditions used in such estimates or assumptions 
if we were to undervalue our derivative liabilities or stock option compensation expense we would understate the expense recognized in our consolidated statements of operation 
conversely if we were to overvalue our derivative liabilities and stock option compensation expenses we would overstate the expense recognized in our consolidated statements of operations 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our financial statements
