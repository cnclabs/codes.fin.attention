in  credit related disconnections represented of total ilec consumer access line deactivations 
management believes these same factors will continue to affect its operations in future years 
wireline has been successful at partially offsetting revenue reductions from access line losses with additional revenue from its fioptics products 
fioptics is a fiber based product offering that provides one of the fastest internet speeds in the company s operating territory  as well as entertainment and voice services 
at year end  the company passed and can provide fioptics service to  units  about of greater cincinnati  and had  entertainment   high speed internet  and  voice fioptics customers 
the penetration rate of this product is over after a one year period following construction in that particular area 
we plan to continue to expand our fiber network and expect revenues from this product to increase in long distance and voip revenues will be impacted by several factors 
as noted above  customers may disconnect local voice service for various reasons 
in doing so  those customers that have our long distance service are likely to disconnect that service as well 
also  as noted above  some customers have disconnected wireline service in order to use service from other providers 
these other providers are normally providing voip service  which we offer to business customers 
we believe our voip operations will continue to expand as business customers look for alternatives to traditional ilec based operations and the voip technology continues to improve 
pricing of local voice services is generally subject to oversight by both state and federal regulatory commissions 
such regulation also covers services  competition  and other public policy issues 
various regulatory rulings and interpretations could result in increases or decreases in these revenues in future periods

wireless wireless postpaid subscribers decreased by  in due to increased competition  as well as customer preference for competitor smartphones  such as the iphone tm 
our operating territory is well saturated with competitors  including verizon  at t  sprint nextel  t mobile  leap and tracfone 
many of these competitors offer very advanced and popular handsets which are not available to us and are a factor in attracting and retaining customers 
most of our competitors are larger and have more resources to devote to advertising and promotional pricing to attract new customers 
we expect competition for wireless customers to continue to be intense in these factors will likely lead to further subscriber losses in wireless postpaid revenue in the future is likely to be affected by data arpu increases as more customers begin using data services and smartphones 
wireless data arpu has increased from in to in and to in given the increasing smartphone subscribers  we expect our data arpu to further increase in however  higher data revenues will likely be offset by lower voice revenue from lower usage

in  the company s board of directors authorized management to pursue the evaluation of structural  capital and financial alternatives for its growing data center business 
management will consider options that may include  among others  operating the data center business under the current structure with no changes  a partial separation through a sale  initial public offering  or other transaction  or  depending on the value to shareholders  a full separation 
the evaluation of these alternatives will include an assessment of the structure that will optimize shareholder value while ultimately leaving the company with an appropriate level of debt

table of contents form k part ii cincinnati bell inc critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates or judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates or judgments 
certain accounting policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
our most significant accounting policies are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
management views critical accounting policies to be those policies that are highly dependent on subjective or complex judgments  estimates or assumptions  and where changes in those estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the company s most critical accounting policies  judgments  and estimates with the audit and finance committee 
the discussion below addresses major judgments used in revenue recognition  accounting for allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable  reviewing the carrying values of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  reviewing the carrying values of long lived assets  accounting for business combinations  accounting for taxes  accounting for pension and postretirement expenses  and accounting for termination benefits 
revenue recognition the company adheres to revenue recognition principles described in financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification topic asc  revenue recognition 
under asc  revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of a sale arrangement  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
with respect to arrangements with multiple deliverables  we determine whether more than one unit of accounting exists in an arrangement 
to the extent that the deliverables are separable into multiple units of accounting  total consideration is allocated to the individual units of accounting based on their relative fair value  determined by the price of each deliverable when it is regularly sold on a stand alone basis 
revenue is recognized for each unit of accounting as delivered  or as service is performed  depending on the nature of the deliverable comprising the unit of accounting 
wireline revenues from local telephone  special access  and internet product services  which are billed monthly prior to performance of service  are not recognized upon billing or cash receipt but rather are deferred until the service is provided 
long distance and switched access are billed monthly in arrears 
wireline bills service revenue in regular monthly cycles  which are spread throughout the days of the month 
as the last day of each billing cycle rarely coincides with the end of the reporting period for usage based services such as long distance and switched access  we must estimate service revenues earned but not yet billed 
our estimates are based upon historical usage  and we adjust these estimates during the period in which actual usage is determinable  typically in the following reporting period 
initial billings for wireline service connection and activation are deferred and amortized into revenue on a straight line basis over the average customer life 
the associated connection and activation costs  to the extent of the upfront fees  are also deferred and amortized on a straight line basis over the average customer life 
pricing of local voice services is generally subject to oversight by both state and federal regulatory commissions 
such regulation also covers services  competition  and other public policy issues 
various regulatory rulings and interpretations could result in increases or decreases to revenue in future periods 
wireless postpaid wireless and reciprocal compensation are billed monthly in arrears 
wireless bills service revenue in regular monthly cycles  which are spread throughout the days of the month 
as the last day of each billing cycle rarely coincides with the end of the reporting period for usage based services such as postpaid wireless  we estimate service revenues 
table of contents form k part ii cincinnati bell inc earned but not yet billed 
our estimates are based upon historical usage  and we adjust these estimates during the period in which actual usage is determinable  typically in the following reporting period 
revenue from prepaid wireless service  which is collected in advance  is not recognized upon billing or cash receipt  but rather is deferred until the service is provided 
wireless handset revenue and the related activation revenue are recognized when the products are delivered to and accepted by the customer  as this is considered to be a separate earnings process from the sale of wireless services 
wireless equipment costs are also recognized upon handset sale and are generally in excess of the related handset and activation revenue 
data center colocation data center colocation services consist primarily of recurring revenue streams from rent of data center space  power  cabinets and cages 
these recurring revenue streams are generally billed monthly in advance and may have escalating payments over the term of the contract 
in arrangements which contain increasing or decreasing monthly billings  revenues are recognized on a straight line basis over the contract term  unless the pattern of service indicates otherwise 
power costs are billed to certain customers in arrears based on actual usage 
an estimate of this revenue is accrued monthly based on historical usage 
power costs are presented on a gross basis in both revenues and cost of services in the accompanying financial statements based upon the criteria in asc data center colocation services can also include revenues from non recurring revenue streams 
non recurring revenue for services or products that are separate units of accounting are recognized as revenue consistent with our accounting policy for arrangements with multiple deliverables presented above 
certain non recurring installation fees  although generally paid in lump sum upon installation  are not considered separate units of accounting 
therefore  these revenues and their associated costs are deferred and recognized ratably over the estimated term of the customer relationship  unless the pattern of service indicates otherwise 
certain agreements with data center customers require specified levels of service or performance 
if we fail to meet these service levels  customers may be able to receive service credits on their accounts 
we record these credits against revenue when an event occurs that gives rise to such credits 
it services and hardware professional services  including product installations  are recognized as the service is provided 
maintenance services on telephony equipment are deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the underlying customer contract  generally one to four years 
equipment revenue is recognized upon the completion of our contractual obligations  such as shipment  delivery  installation  or customer acceptance 
installation service revenue is generally recognized when installation is complete 
the revenue recognition guidance in asc and asc  software  is applied to these transactions 
we have vendor specific evidence of selling price  as we sell equipment and installation services on both a combined and standalone basis 
the company is a reseller of it and telephony equipment 
for these transactions  we consider the gross versus net revenue recording criteria of asc based on this criteria  these equipment revenues and associated costs have generally been recorded on a gross basis  rather than recording the revenues net of the associated costs 
vendor rebates are earned on certain equipment sales 
if the rebate is earned and the amount is determinable  we recognize the rebate as an offset to cost of products sold 
accounting for allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable the allowance for uncollectible accounts is determined using historical percentages of credit losses applied to outstanding aged receivables  as well as specific provisions for certain identifiable  potentially uncollectible balances 
management believes its allowance for uncollectible accounts represents a reasonable estimate of future credit losses 
however  if one or more of our larger customers were to default on its accounts receivable obligations  or if general economic conditions in our operating area deteriorated  our future credit losses could exceed the amount recognized in the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable 
most of our outstanding accounts receivable balances are with companies located within our geographic operating areas 
regional and national telecommunications companies account for most of the remainder of our accounts receivable balances 
as of december  and  receivables with one large customer exceed of the company s total accounts receivable 
our wireline and wireless segments  which comprises and of the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivables as of december   respectively  would be the segments most affected by an adverse development in credit losses 

table of contents form k part ii cincinnati bell inc reviewing the carrying values of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in september  the fasb amended its guidance in asc on testing goodwill for impairment 
as a result of the revised guidance  the company will have the option of performing a qualitative assessment for impairment prior to performing the quantitative tests 
as of december   the company had not yet adopted this new guidance 
the company performs impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets on an annual basis  or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired 
we perform our annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter  when our five year plan is updated 
management estimates the fair value of each reporting unit utilizing a combination of valuation methods  including both income based and market based methods 
the income based approach utilizes a discounted cash flow model using projected cash flows derived from the five year plan  adjusted to reflect market participants assumptions 
expected future cash flows are discounted at the weighted average cost of capital applying a market participant approach 
the market based approach utilizes earnings multiples from comparable publicly traded companies 
in  our wireless reporting unit recognized a goodwill impairment loss of million 
fair value of the reporting unit was estimated using both an income approach and market approach 
the income approach was weighted more heavily than the market approach due to projections of declining revenues 
the impairment resulted from declines in revenues and wireless subscribers 
no impairment losses were recognized on goodwill in or the estimated fair value of goodwill exceeded the carrying value of goodwill by more than for all other reporting units 
wireless owns fcc licenses for spectrum which are indefinite lived intangible assets 
these licenses are generally renewed every ten years for a nominal fee  provided we continue to meet the service and geographic coverage provisions required by the fcc 
the fair value of these licenses was determined by using both the greenfield method and the auction method 
the greenfield method is an income approach technique that presents the expected economics of an actual asset using a hypothetical set of operating assumptions 
specifically  in this approach  a hypothetical start up of a business is assumed wherein the only asset of the business is the spectrum being analyzed 
the auction method measures the value of the spectrum by examining transactions in the marketplace involving the sale of spectrum with attributes similar to those of the subject 
the greenfield method was weighted more heavily than the auction method due to limited transactions in the market 
no impairment was recognized on these licenses in  or as of december   the fair value of these licenses exceeded the carrying value of this asset by 
as of december   trademarks of the company s wireless business were also classified as indefinite lived intangible assets 
as of december   the fair value of these trademarks was determined by using the relief from royalty method  which estimates the present value of royalty expense that could be avoided as a result of owning the respective asset or technology 
no impairment was recognized on these trademarks in or in early  the useful life of these licenses was reassessed  and this asset is now being amortized over an estimated seven year remaining useful life 
changes in certain assumptions could have a significant impact on the impairment tests for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
the most critical assumptions are projected future growth rates  operating margins  capital expenditures  terminal values  and discount rate selection 
these assumptions are subject to change as the company s long term plans and strategies are updated each year 
reviewing the carrying values of long lived assets depreciation of our wireline telephone plant is determined on a straight line basis using the group depreciation method 
depreciation of other property  except for leasehold improvements  is based on the straight line method over the estimated economic useful life 
depreciation of leasehold improvements is based on a straight line method over the lesser of the economic useful life or term of the lease  including option renewal periods if renewal of the lease is reasonably assured 
repair and maintenance expense items are charged to expense as incurred 
the useful lives of plant and equipment are estimated in order to determine the amount of depreciation expense to be recorded during any reporting period 
the majority of wireline s plant and equipment is depreciated using the group method  which develops a depreciation rate annually based on the average useful life of a specific group of assets rather than for each individual asset as would be utilized under the unit method 
the estimated life of the group changes as the composition of the group of assets and their related lives change 
such estimated life of the group is based on historical experience with similar assets  as well as taking into account anticipated technological or other changes 
if technological changes were to occur more rapidly than anticipated  the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened  resulting in the recognition of increased depreciation expense in future periods 
likewise  if the anticipated technological or other changes occur more slowly than expected  the life of the group could be extended based on the life assigned to new assets added to the group 
this could result in a reduction of depreciation expense in future periods 
competition from new or more cost effective technologies could affect our ability to generate cash flow from our network based services 
this competition could ultimately result in an impairment of certain of our tangible or intangible assets 
this 
table of contents form k part ii cincinnati bell inc could have a substantial impact on our future operating results 
a one year change in the useful life of these assets would increase or decrease annual depreciation expense by approximately million 
management reviews the carrying value of long lived assets  other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets discussed above  when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset or group of assets and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount 
an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the asset s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value 
in  we recognized asset impairment losses of million  consisting of million in our wireless segment and million in our wireline segment 
these asset impairments resulted from the abandonment of certain leasehold improvements  equipment and capital projects 
fair value was estimated at zero due to the absence of a resale market for these assets 
no asset impairments were recorded in or accounting for business combinations in accounting for business combinations  we follow asc  business combinations  which requires the recording of net assets of acquired businesses at fair value 
in developing estimates of fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities  management analyzes a variety of factors including market data  estimated future cash flows of the acquired operations  industry growth rates  current replacement cost for fixed assets  and market rate assumptions for contractual obligations 
such a valuation requires significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to the intangible assets 
transaction costs associated with acquisitions are expensed as incurred 
in determining the fair value of the assets acquired with the purchase of cyrusone  management utilized several valuation methods excess earnings method this method was used to determine the fair value of the cyrusone customer relationships 
this method estimates the present value of future cash flows attributable to the customer base and requires estimates of the expected future earnings and remaining useful lives of the customer relationships 
cost method this method was used to determine the fair value of property  plant and equipment 
this method indicates value based on the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of the asset and considers the cost of a buyer to acquire or construct a substitute asset of comparable utility  adjusted for deterioration and obsolescence 
relief from royalty this method  used to determine the fair value of the cyrusone trademark  estimates the present value of royalty expense that could be avoided as a result of owning the respective asset or technology 
in  we finalized the cyrusone purchase price allocation 
no significant changes were made in to the estimates or assumptions applied in the preliminary purchase price allocation 
accounting for taxes income taxes the company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction as well as various foreign  state and local jurisdictions 
the company s previous tax filings are subject to normal reviews by regulatory agencies until the related statute of limitations expires 
with a few exceptions  the company is no longer subject to us federal  state or local examinations for years prior to in  the internal revenue service completed an examination of the company s us federal income tax returns for and the company has net operating loss carryforwards at the federal  state and local levels 
federal tax loss carryforwards are available to offset taxable income in current and future periods 
the majority of these tax loss carryforwards will expire between and and are not currently limited under us tax laws 
the ultimate realization of the deferred income tax assets depends upon our ability to generate future taxable income during the periods in which basis differences and other deductions become deductible and prior to the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards 
based on current income levels and anticipated future reversal of existing temporary differences  management expects to fully utilize its federal net operating loss carryforwards within their expiration periods 
however  realization of certain state and local net operating losses  as well as other deferred tax assets  is not certain 
a valuation allowance of million and million has been recognized as of december  and  respectively 
in  we reduced valuation allowances by million primarily based on the expected future utilization of certain state deferred tax assets 
as of december  and  the liability for unrecognized tax benefits was million and million  respectively 
as of december   the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would affect the effective tax rate is million 
management does not currently anticipate that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change 
table of contents form k part ii cincinnati bell inc significantly over the next year 
accrued penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in income tax expense 
accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits is recognized in interest expense 
operating taxes certain operating taxes are reported as expenses in operating income  such as property  sales  use  and gross receipts taxes 
these taxes are not included in income tax expense because the amounts to be paid are not dependent on the company s level of income 
the expense for certain operating tax audit exposures is also recognized in operating income 
liabilities are established for operating tax audit exposures based on management s assessment of the probability of payment 
upon resolution of an audit  any remaining liability not paid is released and increases operating income 
regulatory taxes federal regulatory taxes are assessed on certain of the company s revenue producing transactions 
we recover certain of these taxes by billing the customer  however  billings cannot exceed the amount due to the federal regulatory agency 
these federal regulatory taxes are presented on a gross basis in sales and cost of services in the consolidated financial statements 
in certain instances  the company does not fully recover these taxes from customers 
revenue associated with regulatory taxes was million in  million in  and million in cost of services associated with these taxes was million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
all other federal taxes collected from customers are presented in the consolidated financial statements on a net basis 
accounting for pension and postretirement expenses in accounting for pension and postretirement expenses  we apply asc  compensation retirement benefits 
a liability has been recognized on the consolidated balance sheet for the unfunded status of the pension and postretirement plans 
actuarial gains losses and prior service costs that arise during the period are recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheet 
the company sponsors three noncontributory defined benefit pension plans one for eligible management employees  one for non management employees  and one supplemental  nonqualified  unfunded plan for certain senior executives 
we also provide healthcare and group life insurance benefits for eligible retirees 
the measurement date for our pension and postretirement obligations is as of december when changes to the plans occur during interim periods  management reviews the changes and determines if a remeasurement is necessary 
in the second quarter of  the company entered into a new labor agreement with its bargained employees which eliminated future pension credits for certain employees effective january  as a result of this event  we remeasured the projected benefit obligation of the non management benefit plan and recognized a curtailment loss of million 
in  the company froze pension benefits for certain management employees below years of age 
we also announced the phase out of retiree healthcare plans for all management employees and certain retirees from the bargained plan in years 
as a result of these events  we remeasured the projected benefit obligation for the associated plans and recognized a curtailment gain of million 
additionally  these benefit changes resulted in substantially all of the remaining participants in the management postretirement plan to be either fully eligible for benefits or retired 
as such  the unrecognized prior service gain and unrecognized actuarial gains are now amortized over the average life expectancy of the management retiree participants rather than the shorter service periods used for the bargained plan and previously used for the management plan 
the measurement of our pension and postretirement projected benefit obligations involves significant assumptions and estimates 
each time we remeasure our projected benefit obligations  we reassess the significant assumptions and estimates 
the actuarial assumptions attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expenses and liabilities related to these plans 
the most significant of these numerous assumptions  which are reviewed annually  include the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates 
discount rate a discount rate is used to measure the present value of projected benefit obligations 
the discount rate for each plan is individually calculated based upon the timing of expected future benefit payments 
our discount rates are developed based upon a yield curve developed to reflect yields available on high quality corporate bonds as of the measurement date 
as of december  and  the discount rate used to value the pension plans was and  respectively  while the discount rate used to value the postretirement plans was and 
lower rates of interest available on high quality corporate bonds drove the decrease in the discount rates in 
table of contents form k part ii cincinnati bell inc expected rate of return the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  developed using the building block approach  is based on the mix of investments held directly by the plans  and the current view of expected future returns  which is influenced by historical averages 
the required use of an expected versus actual long term rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized pension expense or income that is greater or less than the actual returns of those plan assets in any given year 
over time  however  the expected long term returns are designed to approximate the actual long term returns 
as of december  and  a long term rate of return on pension plan assets was estimated at and  respectively 
the decrease in the long term rate of return in reflects management s outlook of lower average returns in future periods  as well as a somewhat higher mix of bonds held in our pension plan trust 
the long term rate of return on postretirement plan assets were estimated to be zero in both periods as these plans have minimal assets with a low rate of return 
actual asset returns for the pension trusts  which represent over of invested assets  were a gain of in  in  and in in our pension calculations  we utilized the market related value of plan assets  which is a calculated asset value that recognizes changes in asset fair values in a systematic and consistent manner 
differences between actual and expected returns are recognized in the market related value of plan assets over five years 
healthcare cost trend our healthcare cost trend rate is developed based on historical cost data  the near term outlook  and an assessment of likely long term trends 
as of both december  and  the healthcare cost trend rate used to measure the postretirement health benefit obligation was 
as of december   the healthcare cost trend rate is assumed to decrease gradually to by the year  compared to reached in the year as assumed at december  the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to the changing market and economic conditions and other changes 
revisions to and variations from these estimates would impact assets  liabilities  equity  cash flow  costs of services and products  and selling  general and administrative expenses 
the following table represents the sensitivity of changes in certain assumptions related to the pension and postretirement plans as of december  pension benefits postretirement and other benefits increase increase increase increase point decrease in decrease in decrease in decrease in dollars in millions change obligation expense obligation expense discount rate expected return on assets n a n a healthcare cost trend rate n a n a at december  and  unrecognized actuarial net losses were million and million  respectively 
the unrecognized net losses have been primarily generated by differences between assumed and actual rates of return on invested assets  changes in discount rates  and healthcare costs 
because gains and losses reflect refinements in estimates as well as real changes in economic values and because some gains in one period may be offset by losses in another or vice versa  we are not required to recognize these gains and losses in the period that they occur 
instead  if the gains and losses exceed a corridor defined in the accounting literature  we amortize the excess over the average remaining service period of active employees for the pension and bargained postretirement plans approximately years and average life expectancy of retirees for the management postretirement plan approximately years 
accounting for termination benefits the company has written severance plans covering both its management and union employees and  as such  accrues probable and estimable employee separation liabilities in accordance with asc  compensation nonretirement postemployment benefits 
these liabilities are based on our historical termination rates  historical severance costs  as well as management s expectation of future severance events 
as of december  and  accrued employee separation liabilities were million and million  respectively  resulting primarily from projected headcount reductions primarily in its wireline segment 
further headcount reductions are anticipated in the next few years as we continue to manage our payroll costs to lower levels 
when employee terminations occur  management also considers the guidance in asc to determine if employee terminations give rise to a pension and postretirement curtailment charge 
our accounting policy is that terminations in a calendar year involving or more of the plan future service years is deemed a plan curtailment 

table of contents form k part ii cincinnati bell inc regulatory matters and competitive trends federal the telecommunications act of was enacted with the goal of establishing a pro competitive  deregulatory framework to promote competition and investment in advanced telecommunications facilities and services to all americans 
from to  federal regulators considered a multitude of proceedings ostensibly aimed at promoting competition and deregulation 
although the act called for a deregulatory framework  the fcc s approach has been to maintain significant regulatory restraints on the traditional incumbent local exchange carriers while increasing opportunities for new competitive entrants and new services by applying minimal regulation 
while the company has expanded beyond its incumbent local exchange operations by offering wireless  long distance  broadband  internet access  voip and out of territory competitive local exchange services  a significant portion of its revenue is still derived from its traditional local exchange services  which remain subject to varying levels of regulation 
since  federal regulators have primarily focused on initiatives to promote investment in and adoption of advanced telecommunications services  particularly broadband internet access services 
on march   the fcc released a national broadband plan nbp  as mandated by congress  to ensure that every american has access to broadband services 
the fcc released an action agenda containing benchmarks for implementing the nbp recommendations that fall under its jurisdiction 
the recommendations are grouped into four key areas accelerating universal broadband access and adoption  fostering competition and maximizing consumer benefits  promoting world leading mobile broadband infrastructure and innovation  and advancing robust and secure public safety communications networks 
many of the fcc s regulatory proceedings are now focused on the fulfillment of the goals of the nbp 
during  the fcc took steps to implement several of the more complex and controversial recommendations and this work is expected to continue throughout the financial impact of the various federal proceedings will depend on many factors including the extent of competition  the timing of the fcc s decisions  and the outcome of any appeals of those decisions 
universal service the federal universal service fund usf is funded via an assessment on the interstate end user revenue of all telecommunications carriers and interconnected voip providers 
the assessment is used to support high cost  low income  rural healthcare  and school and library programs 
as recommended in the nbp  in october the fcc adopted new rules report and order in wc docket no 
 fcc  the order aimed at controlling the size of the high cost portion of the fund and transitioning it from supporting legacy circuit switched networks to broadband 
the order caps the high cost fund and establishes a framework for transitioning support to the new connect america fund caf to bring broadband to unserved areas 
immediate phase i reforms will freeze existing high cost support and provide a mechanism for distributing additional support for price cap companies 
the details of the phase ii reforms will be finalized during and will use a combination of competitive bidding and a forward looking cost model to distribute support in price cap areas 
phase ii caf support will be phased in over a five year period as phase i support is phased out 
a new mobility fund is being established to further the deployment of mobile broadband 
the phase i mobility fund will use reverse auctions to allocate an initial amount of money to deploy mobile broadband infrastructure 
in addition  funds will be allotted for ongoing operating support under the phase ii mobility fund  the details of which must still be developed 
finally  the order implements some initial reforms to limit the high cost support received by rate of return carriers 
it is anticipated that during  the fcc will adopt reforms to the low income support programs in order to control the cost of this portion of the fund and to allow support to be used for broadband services 
cbw began offering lifeline subsidized wireless service in ohio and kentucky in  and had approximately  lifeline subscribers as of december  the fcc is also likely to consider reforms to the contribution mechanism in  but if adopted  any such changes are unlikely to take effect prior to the price cap carrier changes adopted in will freeze cbt s existing high cost support of approximately million for thereafter  the phase i support will be eliminated and it is unlikely that the company will receive significant funds under the phase ii programs 
potential reforms to the low income programs may impact both cbt and cbw during although adoption of a new funding mechanism could have significant impacts for the company  the details of such reform are not yet known and will not occur prior to intercarrier compensation current rules specify different means of compensating carriers for the use of their networks depending on the type of traffic and technology used by the carriers 
as the nbp recommended  in october  in conjunction with its reform of the usf high cost support program  the fcc adopted comprehensive reforms to the switched access and reciprocal compensation rules 
the 
table of contents form k part ii cincinnati bell inc end point of the reforms is a bill and keep system under which all per minute intercarrier charges are eliminated 
beginning in  terminating switched access and reciprocal compensation rates are phased out over a six year period for cbt and a nine year period for rate of return carriers 
the plan establishes a mechanism whereby ilecs may be able to recover some of the lost revenue from increased end user charges and support from the newly created connect america fund 
the transition and recovery mechanism for originating access and transport rates has not yet been established by the fcc 
the impact of these reforms for the company will primarily fall on cbt 
the impact will be relatively insignificant  but the impact will increase each year during the six year transition to bill and keep 
the company s terminating switched access and reciprocal compensation revenue subject to these rules totaled approximately million in  and will be phased out to zero over the six year transition period 
the potential to offset these losses via increased end user charges will primarily depend on competitive conditions in the ilec operating area 
special access in  the fcc opened a proceeding to review the current special access pricing rules 
under the existing rules  special access services are subject to price cap regulation with no earnings cap 
this proceeding examines the entire special access pricing structure  including whether or not to reinstate an earnings cap 
as recommended in the nbp  during the fcc continued to analyze whether the existing rules ensure just and reasonable rates 
the impact of any action by the fcc in this proceeding is still uncertain 
voip although the fcc does not classify voip services as telecommunications services or information services  it has applied many traditional telecommunications service obligations to voip service providers  including  among others   universal service funding  local number portability  telecommunications relay service  and regulations governing customer proprietary network information 
in november  the fcc declared that states may levy usf assessments on nomadic voip service intrastate revenue 
since that time  an increasing number of states have required voip providers to register with the state and have extended usf assessments to interconnected voip services 
the usf intercarrier compensation order adopted by the fcc in the fourth quarter of brought voip public switched telephone network pstn traffic under the intercarrier compensation framework and established transitional default intercarrier compensation rates for toll voip pstn traffic under interstate access rates  effectively preempting state authority to subject this traffic to intrastate access charges 
these recent changes have relatively insignificant and offsetting impacts within the company 
broadband internet access net neutrality in an order adopted in  the fcc provided wireline carriers the option of offering broadband internet access as a non regulated information service comparable treatment to cable modem internet access or as a regulated telecommunications service 
in  cbt elected the non regulated information service designation for its broadband internet access service 
the fcc also ruled that wireless broadband service is a non regulated information service  placing it on the same regulatory footing as other broadband services such as cable modem service and wireline dsl service 
in conjunction with the adoption of the wireline broadband internet access order  the fcc adopted a policy statement intended to ensure that broadband networks are widely deployed  open  affordable  and accessible to all consumers 
in  the fcc opened a proceeding to codify the net neutrality principles established in the policy statement 
however  in april  the dc circuit court of appeals issued an opinion finding that an fcc enforcement action regarding comcast s network management practices exceeded the fcc s authority  causing the fcc to reassess its approach to crafting net neutrality rules 
in december  the fcc adopted net neutrality rules that require broadband providers to publicly disclose network management practices  restrict them from blocking internet content and applications  and prohibit fixed broadband providers from engaging in unreasonable discrimination in transmitting traffic 
although appeals of these rules are pending  the rules took effect in the company s wireline and wireless operations implemented procedures to comply with the rules 
fcc safeguards to protect customer proprietary network information cpni in  the fcc released an order implementing new cpni rules designed to prevent pretexting to gain access to customer information 
the rules  which became effective in december  require carriers to implement security protections limiting the manner in which certain customer information may be released and requiring notice to customers regarding certain types of changes to their account and cpni breaches 
carriers must file an annual certification with the fcc that they are compliant with the rules  including a summary of actions taken in response to customer complaints 

table of contents form k part ii cincinnati bell inc state cbt has operated under alternative regulation plans for its local services since these plans restrict the ability to increase the price of basic local service and related services but  in return  prevent cbt from being subject to an earnings cap 
under alternative regulation  price increases and enhanced flexibility for some services partially offset the effect of fixed pricing for basic local service and reduced pricing for other  primarily wholesale services 
statutory changes enacted by the ohio general assembly in august gave the public utilities commission of ohio puco the authority to provide ilecs with pricing flexibility for basic local rates upon a showing that consumers have sufficient competitive alternatives house bill 
under these rules  cbt applied for and received authority from the puco to increase its rates for basic local exchange service in eight of its ohio exchanges and subsequently implemented rate increases for basic local exchange service in all of these exchanges 
in september  the ohio general assembly enacted substitute senate bill  which revised state policy concerning the provision of telecommunications service  repealed ohio s existing alternative regulation legislation  and authorized pricing flexibility for ilec basic local exchange service upon a competitive showing by the ilec 
in december  cbt filed an application with the puco under the new rules to receive pricing flexibility in its four ohio exchanges that did not have pricing flexibility under alternative regulation 
the application was approved in january  and cbt implemented a rate increase for basic local exchange service in all of its ohio exchanges beginning in the first quarter of furthermore  the new legislation provided cost savings and revenue opportunities resulting from revision of the puco s retail rules and service standards that were effective in january cbt entered into its existing alternative regulation plan in kentucky in july under terms established by the kentucky general assembly in house bill no 
under this plan  basic local exchange service prices were capped in exchange for earnings freedom and pricing flexibility on other retail services 
the caps on basic local exchange service prices expired in july and cbt increased rates for basic local exchange service for residential lines in december and business lines in january ohio and kentucky cable franchises the state of ohio permits statewide video service authorization 
the company is now authorized by ohio to provide service in our self described territory with only day notification to the local government entity and other providers
