item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations analysis of financial condition  liquidity and resources below  to maintain our cash position and ensure liquidity 
however  challenging market conditions that reduce demand for our products could weaken our liquidity position and materially adversely affect net revenues available for anticipated cash needs 
to the extent the initiatives we undertake are not successful or we are unable to successfully implement alternative actions  our ability to cover both short term and long term operation requirements would be significantly adversely affected 
cyclicality and seasonality the recreation vehicle industry has been characterized by cycles of growth and contraction in consumer demand  reflecting prevailing economic and demographic conditions  which affect disposable income for leisure time activities 
consequently  the results for any prior period may not be indicative of results for any future period 
seasonal factors  over which we have no control  also have an effect on the demand for our products 
demand in the recreation vehicle industry generally declines over the winter season  while sales are generally highest during the spring and summer months 
also  unusually severe weather conditions in some markets may impact demand 
integration of acquisitions in fiscal we made an acquisition of a towable manufacturer 
the integration and introduction of new models of recreation vehicles is important to our future growth 
we may incur unexpected expenses and the acceptance of a new product line is uncertain 
we may not be able to obtain efficiencies of scale in back office processes or obtain expected purchasing efficiencies 
table of contents via increased volume from mutual suppliers 
potential loss of a large dealer organization one of our dealer organizations  freedomroads  llc  accounted for of our net revenue for fiscal  as they sold our products in of their dealership locations across us states 
the loss of this dealer organization could have a significant adverse effect on our business 
in addition  deterioration in the liquidity or creditworthiness of freedomroads  llc could negatively impact our sales and could trigger repurchase obligations under our repurchase agreements 
potential repurchase liabilities in accordance with customary practice in the rv industry  upon request we enter into formal repurchase agreements with lending institutions financing a dealer s purchase of our products 
in these repurchase agreements we agree  in the event of a default by an independent dealer in its obligation to a lender and repossession of the unit s by the lending institution  to repurchase units at declining prices over the term of the agreements  which can last up to months 
the difference between the gross repurchase price and the price at which the repurchased product can then be resold  which is typically at a discount to the gross repurchase price  represents a potential expense to us 
in certain instances  we also repurchase inventory from our dealers due to state law or regulatory requirements that govern voluntary or involuntary terminations 
if we are obligated to repurchase a substantially larger number of rvs in the future  this would increase our costs and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
fuel availability and price volatility gasoline or diesel fuel is required for the operation of motorized recreation vehicles 
there can be no assurance that the supply of these petroleum products will continue uninterrupted or that the price or tax on these petroleum products will not significantly increase in the future 
fuel shortages and substantial increases in fuel prices have had a material adverse effect on the recreation vehicle industry as a whole in the past and could have a material adverse effect on us in the future 
dependence on suppliers most of our rv components are readily available from numerous sources 
however  a few of our components are produced by a small group of quality suppliers 
in the case of motor home chassis  ford motor company  freightliner custom chassis corporation and mercedes benz usa and canada are our major suppliers 
our relationship with our chassis suppliers is similar to our other supplier relationships in that no special contractual commitments are engaged in by either party 
historically  chassis suppliers resort to an industry wide allocation system during periods when supply is restricted 
these allocations have been based on the volume of chassis previously purchased 
sales of motor homes rely on chassis and are affected accordingly 
decisions by our suppliers to decrease production  production delays  or work stoppages by the employees of such suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our ability to produce motor homes and ultimately  on the results of operations 
warranty claims we receive warranty claims from our dealers in the ordinary course of our business 
although we maintain reserves for such claims  which to date have been adequate  there can be no assurance that warranty expense levels will remain at current levels or that such reserves will continue to be adequate 
a significant increase in warranty claims exceeding our current warranty expense levels could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
in addition to the costs associated with the contractual warranty coverage provided on our products  we also occasionally incur costs as a result of additional service actions not covered by our warranties  including product recalls and customer satisfaction actions 
although we estimate and reserve for the cost of these service actions  there can be no assurance that expense levels will remain at current levels or such reserves will continue to be adequate 
product liability we are subject  in the ordinary course of business  to litigation including a variety of warranty  lemon law and product liability claims typical in the recreation vehicle industry 
we have an insurance policy covering product liability  however  we are self insured for a portion of product liability claims 
we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all future claims against us  which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
any increase in the frequency and size of these claims  as compared to our experience in prior years  may cause the premium that we are required to pay for insurance to rise significantly 
it may also increase the amounts we pay in punitive damages  not all of which are covered by our insurance 
in addition  if these claims rise to a level of frequency or size that are significantly higher than similar claims made against our competitors  our reputation and business may be harmed 
information systems and web applications we rely on our information systems and web applications to support our business operations  including but not limited to procurement  supply chain  manufacturing  distribution  warranty administration  invoicing and collection of payments 
we use information systems to report and audit our operational results 
additionally  we rely upon information systems in our sales  
table of contents marketing  human resources and communication efforts 
due to our reliance on our information systems  our business processes may be negatively impacted in the event of substantial disruption of service 
further  misuse  leakage or falsification of information could result in a violation of privacy laws and damage our reputation which could  in turn  have a negative impact on our results 
government regulation we are subject to numerous federal  state and local regulations governing the manufacture and sale of our products  including the provisions of the mva  and the safety standards for recreation vehicles and components which have been established under the motor vehicle act by the department of transportation 
the mva authorizes the national highway traffic safety administration to require a manufacturer to recall and repair vehicles which contain certain hazards or defects 
any major recalls of our vehicles  voluntary or involuntary  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
while we believe we are substantially in compliance with the foregoing laws and regulations as they currently exist  amendments to any of these regulations or the implementation of new regulations could significantly increase the cost of manufacturing  purchasing  operating or selling our products and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  our failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us  potential civil and criminal liability  suspension of sales or production or cessation of operations 
we are also subject to federal and numerous state consumer protection and unfair trade practice laws and regulations relating to the sale  transportation and marketing of motor vehicles  including so called lemon laws 
federal and state laws and regulations also impose upon vehicle operators various restrictions on the weight  length and width of motor vehicles  including motor homes that may be operated in certain jurisdictions or on certain roadways 
certain jurisdictions also prohibit the sale of vehicles exceeding length restrictions 
finally  federal and state authorities also have various environmental control standards relating to air  water  noise pollution and hazardous waste generation and disposal which affect us and our operations 
failure by us to comply with present or future laws and regulations could result in fines being imposed on us  potential civil and criminal liability  suspension of production or operations  alterations to the manufacturing process  or costly cleanup or capital expenditures  any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
risks related to our company anti takeover effect provisions of our articles of incorporation  by laws  the iowa business corporation act and provisions in our credit facilities that we may enter into from time to time could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial by our shareholders 
the combination of these provisions effectively inhibits a non negotiated merger or other business combination  which  in turn  could adversely affect the market price of our common stock
