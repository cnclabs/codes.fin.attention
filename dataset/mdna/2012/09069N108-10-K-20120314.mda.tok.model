business overview we are a leading national provider of pharmacy and home health services that partners with patients  physicians  hospitals  healthcare payors and pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide clinical management solutions and the delivery of cost effective access to prescription medications and home health services 
our services are designed to improve clinical outcomes to patients with chronic and acute healthcare conditions while controlling overall healthcare costs 
as of december   we had a total of locations in states plus the district of columbia  including community pharmacy locations  home nursing locations  three mail service facilities and home infusion locations  including two contract affiliated infusion pharmacies 
our platform provides nationwide service capabilities and the ability to deliver clinical management services that offer patients a high touch  community based and home based care environment 
our core services are provided in coordination with  and under the direction of  a patient s physician 
our home health professionals  including pharmacists  nurses  respiratory therapists and physical therapists  work with the physician to develop a plan of care suited to our patient s specific needs 
whether in the home  physician office  ambulatory infusion center or other alternate sites of care  we provide products  services and condition specific clinical management programs tailored to improve the care of individuals with complex health conditions such as gastrointestinal abnormalities  hiv aids  cancer  iron overload  multiple sclerosis  organ transplants  bleeding disorders  rheumatoid arthritis  immune deficiencies and congestive heart failure 
our business is currently reported under two segments infusion home health services and pharmacy services 
these two segments reflect how our chief operating decision maker reviews our results in terms of allocating resources and assessing operating and financial performance 
the infusion home health services segment provides services consisting of home infusion therapy  respiratory therapy and the provision of durable medical equipment products and services 
infusion services include the dispensing and administering of infusion based drugs  which typically require additional nursing and clinical management services  equipment to administer the correct dosage and patient training designed to improve patient outcomes 
home infusion services also include the dispensing of self injectible therapies 
home health services include the provision of skilled nursing services and therapy visits  private duty nursing services  hospice services  rehabilitation services and medical social services to patients primarily in their home 
since the acquisition of critical homecare solutions holdings  inc chs in march   we have implemented certain managed care contracts across the integrated infusion home health services segment 
the contracted rates have reduced reimbursement levels compared to the out of network reimbursement levels received prior to june   when we began the process of moving certain out of network payors under national contracts 
on a year over year basis  the contracts have reduced net revenue per patient in certain therapies and drug classes and  correspondingly  our gross profit margin and segment adjusted ebitda  as defined below 
however  the contract relationship allows greater access to more insured lives 
we have seen sequential and year over year volume trends increase from these contracted relationships 
over the next year  we anticipate there will be continued growth in patient volume related to these contracts  with the opportunity to improve product mix in order to mitigate the impact to gross margin 
the pharmacy services segment consists of our traditional and specialty pharmacy mail operations  community pharmacies and integrated pbm services  which includes discount cash card programs 
these segment operations are designed to offer customers and patients cost effective delivery of traditional and specialty pharmacy products and services 
the services also 
table of contents include care management programs customized to each patient s care plan in coordination with the patient s physician 
on a comparative basis  the infusion home health services segment has historically maintained a higher gross margin as a percent of revenue than the pharmacy services segment 
however  due to costs associated with the management of the large number of care professionals involved in delivering services  the infusion home health services segment also operates at a higher operating expense to revenue ratio 
in the fourth quarter of  we commenced a strategic assessment of our business and operations 
this assessment focused on expanding revenue opportunities and lowering corporate overhead  including workforce and benefit reductions and facility rationalization 
salaries and benefits decreased by million during the year ended december  compared to the prior year as a result of the execution of the strategic assessment and related restructuring plan 
the full impact of the salaries and benefits reductions are expected to be realized in we have also recognized cost savings in other areas of the business  such as rent and other facility costs 
in addition to addressing corporate overhead  the strategic assessment examined our market strengths and opportunities and compared our position to that of our competitors 
as a result of the assessment  we focused our growth on investments in the infusion home health services segment and elected to pursue offers for a large portion of our pharmacy services segment 
as a result  on february   subsequent to the fiscal year end  the company entered into a community pharmacy and mail business purchase agreement the asset purchase agreement by and among walgreen co 
and certain subsidiaries collectively  the buyers and the company and certain subsidiaries collectively  the sellers with respect to the sale of certain assets  rights and properties the pharmacy services asset sale relating to the sellers traditional and specialty pharmacy mail and community retail pharmacy store operations 
pursuant to the terms of the asset purchase agreement  we will receive a total purchase price of approximately million at closing  including the value of inventories on hand attributable to the operations subject to the pharmacy services asset sale 
an additional million of purchase price may be payable based on events related directly or indirectly to the retention of certain business by the buyers included in the pharmacy services asset sale 
the purchase price excludes all accounts receivable and working capital liabilities relating to the operations subject to the pharmacy services asset sale having dates of service prior to the closing date of the pharmacy services asset sale  which were carried at approximately million of net assets based on the consolidated balance sheets as of december   and will be retained by us 
the pharmacy services asset sale and the other transactions contemplated by the asset purchase agreement are subject to various closing conditions  including the accuracy of representations and warranties and compliance with covenants  receipt of certain contractual consents  receipt of regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions 
during the first quarter of  the transaction received anti trust clearance under the hart scott rodino act 
the operations subject to the pharmacy services asset sale represent a significant portion of the net asset value and revenue in the pharmacy services segment and less than half of the segment adjusted ebitda of that segment 
the proposed transaction would include the sale of community pharmacy locations and certain asset of three traditional and specialty mail service operations  which constitute all of our operations in the community pharmacy and mail order lines of business 
the carrying value of the net assets subject to the pharmacy services asset sale was approximately million at december  assuming the pharmacy services asset sale is consummated  we intend to explore strategic alternatives to maximize stockholder value going forward  including deploying the proceeds of the pharmacy services asset sale and our other assets in seeking business acquisition opportunities 
options that we may consider include reducing the revolving credit facility  redeeming a portion of the unsecured notes and reinvesting certain proceeds in the infusion home health services segment  subject to the terms of our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our the senior unsecured notes 
if we consummate the pharmacy services asset sale discussed above  we expect to undertake a further strategic assessment of our business and operations in order to align our corporate structure with our remaining business operations 
as part of these efforts  we may incur significant charges such as the write down of certain long lived assets  employee severance  other restructuring type charges  potential cash bonus payments and potential accelerated payments of certain of our contractual obligations  which may impact our future consolidated financial statements 

table of contents the operating results of the traditional and specialty pharmacy mail operations and community pharmacies for the years ended december   and are summarized below in thousands years ended december  revenue gross profit regulatory matters update approximately of revenue for the year ended december  was derived directly from medicare  state medicaid programs or other government payors 
also  we provide services to beneficiaries of medicare  medicaid and other government sponsored healthcare programs through managed care entities 
medicare part d  for example  is administered through managed care entities 
in the normal course of business  the company and our customers are subject to legislative and regulatory changes impacting the level of reimbursement received from the medicare and state medicaid programs 
state medicaid programs in  increased medicaid spending  combined with slow state revenue growth  led many states to institute measures aimed at controlling spending growth 
spending cuts have taken many forms including reducing eligibility and benefits  eliminating certain types of services  and provider reimbursement reductions 
in addition  some states are moving beneficiaries to managed care programs in an effort to reduce costs 
no single state medicaid program represents greater than of our consolidated revenue for the year ended december  and no individual state medicaid reimbursement reduction to us as a provider is expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
we are continually assessing the impact of the state medicaid reimbursement cuts as states propose  finalize and implement various cost saving measures 
we did incur a reimbursement cut in from tenncare  the state of tennessee medicaid program  for certain home health services  and we will incur a second tenncare rate cut in the infusion home health services segment effective january  we also incurred a reimbursement cut from the new york medicaid program in changes to medi cal  the state of california s medicaid program  were approved by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms in october  these changes generally reduce rates by approximately  with many of the reductions retroactive to june  the impact of these changes cannot be predicted with certainty because they are the subject of a number of lawsuits 
preliminary injunctions have been issued that temporarily block the state from implementing the rate reductions  but we cannot predict whether the court will ultimately determine to issue permanent injunctions 
other states have announced plans to cut reimbursements in but none have been finalized 
given the reimbursement pressures  we continue to improve operational efficiencies and reduce costs to mitigate the impact on results of operations where possible 
in some cases  reimbursement rate reductions may result in negative operating results  and we would likely exit some or all services where rate reductions result in unacceptable returns to our shareholders 
medicare federal efforts to reduce medicare spending are expected to continue in congress first passed the patient protection and affordable care act ppaca  and the health care and education reconciliation act of  which amended ppaca 
in august  congress passed a deficit reduction agreement that created a super committee that was tasked with proposing legislation by november  because the super committee did not act  automatic medicare cuts will go into effect 
it is not possible to estimate at this time how such cuts would affect our results of operations  but we do expect reimbursement pressures to continue 
thus far  we have been impacted by cms rule revisions which reduced reimbursement rates applicable to the home health division of our business 
in november  the cms issued a final rule to update and revise medicare home health rates for calendar year the final rule decreased the reimbursement base rate for by 
this reduction resulted in a decrease in our infusion home health segment revenue and gross profit by approximately million for the year ending december  in october  cms issued a final rule to update and revise medicare home health rates for calendar year our estimates suggest that the final rule will reduce our infusion home health segment revenue and gross profit by 
table of contents million on an annual basis compared to assuming no changes in the mix or volume of patients that we serve 
further cuts are expected in critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
in preparing our financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that may not be readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results may differ from these estimates  and different assumptions or conditions may yield different estimates 
the following discussion highlights what we believe to be the critical accounting estimates and judgments made in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all the accounting estimates or judgments made in the preparation of our financial statements and in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap  with no need for management s judgment in its application 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report  which contain a description of our accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap 
revenue recognition we generate revenue principally through the sale of prescription drugs and nursing services 
prescription drugs are dispensed either through a pharmacy participating in our pharmacy network or a pharmacy owned by us 
fee for service agreements include i pharmacy agreements  where we dispense prescription medications through our pharmacy facilities and ii pbm agreements  where prescription medications are dispensed through pharmacies participating in our retail pharmacy network as well as through our traditional mail service facility 
financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc subtopic  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements asc  addresses situations in which there are multiple deliverables under one revenue arrangement with a customer and provides guidance in determining whether multiple deliverables should be recognized separately or in combination 
we provide a variety of therapies to patients 
for infusion related therapies  we frequently provide multiple deliverables of drugs and related nursing services 
after applying the criteria from asc  we concluded that separate units of accounting exist in revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
drug revenue is recognized at the time the drug is shipped  and nursing revenue is recognized on the date of service 
the company allocates revenue consideration based on the relative fair value as determined by the company s best estimate of selling price to separate the revenue where there are multiple deliverables under one revenue arrangement 
revenue generated under pbm agreements is classified as either gross or net based on whether we are acting as a principal or an agent in the fulfillment of prescriptions through our retail pharmacy network 
when we independently have a contractual obligation to pay a network pharmacy provider for benefits provided to its plan sponsors members  and therefore are the primary obligor as defined in asc topic  revenue recognition asc  we include payments which include the drug ingredient cost from these plan sponsors as revenue and payments to the network pharmacy providers as cost of revenue 
these transactions require us to pay network pharmacy providers  assume credit risk of plan sponsors and act as a principal 
if we merely act as an agent  and consequently administer plan sponsors network pharmacy contracts  we do not have the primary obligation to pay the network pharmacy and assume credit risk and as such record only the administrative fees and not the drug ingredient cost as revenue 
revenue generated under discount cash card agreements is recognized when the discount cash card is used to purchase a prescription drug 
the revenue is based on contractual rates per transaction 
broker fees associated with the marketing of the discount cash cards are incurred and recognized at the time the card is used and classified as selling  general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
in our infusion home health services segment  we also recognize infusion nursing revenue as the estimated net realizable amounts from patients and plan sponsors for services rendered and products provided 
this revenue is recognized as the treatment plan is administered to the patient and is recorded at amounts estimated to be received under reimbursement or payment arrangements with payors 

table of contents under the medicare prospective payment system program  home health net revenue is recorded based on a reimbursement rate which varies based on the severity of the patient s condition  service needs and certain other factors 
revenue is recognized ratably over a day episode period and is subject to adjustment during this period if there are significant changes in the patient s condition during the treatment period or if the patient is discharged but readmitted to another agency within the same day episodic period 
medicare cash receipts under the prospective payment system are initially recognized as deferred revenue and are subsequently recognized as revenue over the day episode period 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on estimates of losses related to receivable balances 
the risk of collection varies based upon the product  the payor commercial health insurance and government and the patient s ability to pay the amounts not reimbursed by the payor 
we estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts based upon several factors including the age of the outstanding receivables  the historical experience of collections  adjusting for current economic conditions and  in some cases  evaluating specific customer accounts for the ability to pay 
collection agencies are employed and legal action is taken when we determine that taking collection actions is reasonable relative to the probability of receiving payment on amounts owed 
management judgment is used to assess the collectability of accounts and the economic ability of our customers to pay 
judgment is also used to assess trends in collections and the effects of systems and business process changes on our expected collection rates 
the company reviews the estimation process quarterly and makes changes to the estimates as necessary 
when it is determined that a customer account is uncollectible  that balance is written off against the existing allowance 
the following table sets forth the aging of our december  and december  net accounts receivable net of allowance for contractual adjustments and prior to allowance for doubtful accounts  aged based on date of service and categorized based on the three primary overall types of accounts receivable characteristics in thousands as of december  days over days total government commercial patient allowance for doubtful accounts total as of december  days over days total government commercial patient allowance for doubtful accounts total government includes million and million and commercial includes million and million of accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts related to the termination of the centers for medicare medicaid competitive acquisition program cap contract as of december  and  respectively 
commercial includes one pharmacy network agreement under which various plan sponsors are served and which plan sponsors account for  in the aggregate  receivables that accounted for and of the company s total accounts receivable balance as of december  and  respectively 
commercial balances over days old increased from million at december  to million at december  this increase of million is partially due to increased infusion revenue mix and claims billed under medical plans which customarily take longer to collect than traditional pharmacy claims 
in addition  patient balances have grown as employers have raised deductibles and copays on company sponsored plans 
concurrent to these increases  we have also increased the allowance for bad debts by million over the same period to provide for risk of collection on these aged balances 

table of contents allowance for contractual discounts we are reimbursed by plan sponsors for products and services we provide 
payments for medications and services covered by plan sponsors are generally less than billed charges 
we monitor revenue and receivables from plan sponsors on an account specific basis and record an estimated contractual allowance for certain revenue and receivable balances at the revenue recognition date to properly account for anticipated differences between amounts billed and amounts reimbursed 
accordingly  the total revenue and receivables reported in our financial statements are recorded at the amounts expected to be received from these payors 
since billing functions for a majority of our revenue are largely computerized  which enables on line adjudication ie  submitting charges to medicare  medicaid or other third party payors electronically  with simultaneous feedback of the amount the primary insurance plan expects to pay at the time of sale to record net revenue  exposure to estimating contractual allowance adjustments is limited primarily to unbilled and or initially rejected medicare  medicaid and third party claims typically approved for reimbursement once additional information is provided to the payor 
for the remaining portion of our revenue  the contractual allowance is estimated based on several criteria  including unbilled and or initially rejected claims  historical trends based on actual claims paid  current contract and reimbursement terms  and changes in customer base and payor product mix 
contractual allowance estimates are adjusted to actual amounts as cash is received and claims are settled 
we do not believe these changes in estimates are material 
amounts due to plan sponsors payables to plan sponsors primarily represent payments received from plan sponsors in excess of the contractually required reimbursement 
these amounts are refunded to plan sponsors 
these payables also include the sharing of manufacturers rebates with plan sponsors in the pharmacy services segment 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we account for income taxes under asc topic  income taxes asc 
asc requires the use of the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred taxes are determined by calculating the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial accounting and tax bases of existing assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize the benefit from our deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance is reversed when sufficient evidence exists that we will be able to realize the benefits of our deferred tax assets 
we file income tax returns  including returns for our subsidiaries  as prescribed by federal tax laws and the tax laws of the state and local jurisdictions in which we operate 
our uncertain tax positions are related to tax years that remain subject to examination and are recognized in the financial statements when the recognition threshold and measurement attributes of asc are met 
interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded as income tax expense 
goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other asc  we evaluate goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or circumstances exist that indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable 
the goodwill valuation is based on a two step process 
the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the first step indicates that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the second step must be performed which determines the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill 
the measurement of possible impairment is based upon the comparison of the implied fair value of reporting unit to its carrying value 
we use a third party valuation specialist to assist in the annual impairment valuation 
as of december   our reporting units include goodwill of million and indefinite lived assets of million in the infusion home health reporting unit and goodwill of million in the pharmacy services reporting unit 
the goodwill of the infusion home health reporting unit was recorded as a result of the acquisition of chs in march in performing an annual evaluation of goodwill  a reporting unit fair value is determined based on discounted future cash flows and a market based comparison to industry peers 
significant estimates used in a fair value determination include future forecasted earnings and the working capital requirements of the business to generate estimated cash flows 
carrying values are determined based on the specific assets and liabilities of each reporting unit and allocations of corporate assets  liabilities and expenses 
if future cash flows do not achieve estimated levels  goodwill could be become impaired in future periods 

table of contents as of december   indefinite lived intangible assets included million in certificates of need and million of trademarks acquired in the chs transaction 
these intangible assets are evaluated for impairment using techniques similar to the goodwill valuation described above 
definite lived intangible assets are also evaluated to determine if the carrying value of those assets is recoverable 
as of december   definite lived intangible assets included million in trademarks  trade names and customer relationships acquired in the chs transaction 
definite lived intangible assets also included million in assets related to the acquisition of the prescription pharmacy business from ds pharmacy 
the value of these assets is determined based largely upon discounted cash flows 
if future cash flows do not achieve estimated levels  intangible assets could become impaired in future periods 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate that the remaining estimated useful life of long lived assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with the provisions of asc topic  property  plant and equipment asc 
the measurement of possible impairment of property  plant and equipment is based on the ability to recover the balance of assets from expected future operating cash flows on an undiscounted basis 
impairment losses  if any  would be determined based on the present value of the cash flows using discount rates that reflect the inherent risk of the underlying business 
accounting for stock base compensation compensation cost for all share based payments are based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of asc topic  compensation stock compensation asc 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a binomial option pricing model that uses the following assumptions i expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock  ii the risk free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant  and iii the expected life of options granted is derived from previous history of stock exercises from the grant date and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
we use historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination assumptions under the valuation model 
the fair value of the award is amortized to expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
we expense restricted stock awards based on vesting requirements  including time elapsed  market conditions  and or performance conditions 
because of these requirements  the weighted average period for which the expense is recognized varies 
we expense stock appreciation right sar awards based on vesting requirements 
in addition  because they are settled with cash  the fair value of the sar awards are revalued on a quarterly basis 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as special purpose entities or variable interest entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes 
as of december   we are not involved in any unconsolidated special purpose entities or variable interest entities 
reclassifications certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
such reclassifications had no material effect on our previously reported consolidated financial statements 

table of contents results of operations the following discussion is based on the consolidated financial statements of the company 
it compares our annual results of operations with the prior year results of operations 
year ended december  vs 
december  year ended december  in thousands change revenue gross profit income from operations interest expense  net income loss before income taxes net income loss revenue 
revenue for the year ended december  was billion compared to revenue of billion for the year ended december  infusion home health services segment revenue for the year ended december  was million  compared to revenue of million for the same period in  an increase of million  or 
product revenue increased million  or  as a result of incremental first quarter revenue contributed by the legacy critical homecare solutions  inc chs business  which was acquired march  service revenue increased million  or  as a result of incremental revenue contributed by the chs acquisition 
this increase was partially offset by a million revenue reduction resulting from a decrease in medicare home health rates for the calendar year and tenncare s decrease in reimbursement rates as of july  excluding first quarter incremental revenue associated with the acquired chs business  our infusion home health services segment revenue increased million  or  over the prior period as a result of overall volume growth 
pharmacy services segment revenue for the year ended december  was billion compared to revenue of billion for the same period in  an increase of million  or 
product revenue increased million  or  primarily due to revenue from new managed care contracts  growth in the oncology  rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis therapies and industry wide drug inflation 
service revenue increased million  or  due primarily to an increase in discount cash card programs sales 
cost of revenue and gross profit 
cost of revenue for the year ended december  was billion compared to billion for the same period in gross profit for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the same period in  an increase of million  or 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to in the year ended december  from in the year ended december  the increase in gross profit and in gross profit as a percentage of revenue was the result of the acquisition of chs  which favorably impacted gross margin rates  and growth in discount cash card program volumes 
since the acquisition of chs  we have implemented certain managed care contracts across the integrated infusion home health services segment 
the contracted rates have reduced reimbursement levels compared to the out of network reimbursement levels received prior to june   when we began the process of moving certain out of network payors under national contracts 
on a year over year basis  the contracts have reduced net revenue per patient in certain therapies and drug classes and  correspondingly  our gross profit margin 
however  the contract relationship allows greater access to more insured lives 
we have seen sequential and year over year volume trends increase from these contracted relationships 
over the next year  we anticipate there will be continued growth in patient volume related to these contracts  with the opportunity to improve product mix in order to mitigate the impact to gross margin 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a for the year ended december  were million  or of total revenue  compared to million  or of total revenue  for the same period in the increase in sg a was primarily due to million of additional expense related to our expanded operations after acquiring chs  an increase of million in brokers fees related to growth in our discount cash card programs and a million increase in severance and other employee costs 
due to costs associated with the management of the large 
table of contents number of care professionals involved in delivering services  the infusion home health services segment operates at a higher operating expense to revenue ratio 
these increases were partially offset by a net million decrease in salaries and employee benefits  as a result of savings from the restructuring efforts 
bad debt expense 
for the year ended december   bad debt expense was million  or of revenue  compared to million  or of revenue  for the same period in bad debt expense in included expense of million related to the termination of the centers for medicare medicaid competitive acquisition program cap contract 
excluding the cap costs  bad debt expense increased by million primarily related to the acquisition of chs and the resulting increase in revenue and also due to increased write offs associated with aged patient copays 
acquisition and integration expenses 
we did not incur acquisition and integration related expenses during the year ended december  during the year ended december   we incurred million of costs related to the acquisitions of chs and ds pharmacy 
these costs were primarily related to legal  audit and financial advisory fees associated with the acquisition of chs and overtime and temporary wage costs and other integration costs associated with the acquisition of ds pharmacy 
restructuring expense 
as a result of the execution of our strategic assessment and related restructuring plan  we incurred restructuring expenses of approximately million during the year ended december  restructuring expenses during the year ended december  consisted of approximately million of third party consulting costs  million of employee severance and other benefit related costs related to workforce reductions  million of facility related costs and million of other costs 
restructuring expenses during year ended december  consisted of approximately million of employee severance and other benefit related costs related to workforce reductions and million of third party consulting costs 
a large part of the consulting costs and other costs were associated with the analysis of our assets and their long term strategic value relative to other assets in which we could invest 
the result of this assessment was to explore offers for the majority of the pharmacy services segment and culminated in the asset purchase agreement providing for the sale of the company s traditional and specialty pharmacy mail operations and community pharmacies to walgreen co 
and certain of its subsidiaries 
amortization of intangibles 
during the year ended december   we recorded amortization of intangible assets of million compared to million for the prior year 
the amortization related to the intangible assets recorded as a result of the chs and ds pharmacy acquisitions 
legal settlement 
following responses to government subpoenas and discussions with the government  in may  we were advised of a qui tam lawsuit filed under seal in federal court in minnesota in and naming us as defendant 
the complaint alleged violations of healthcare statutes and regulations by the company and predecessor companies dating back to we have negotiated an agreement in principle to resolve all issues alleged in the complaint and the government s investigation in exchange for a release and dismissal of the claims 
the resolution is subject to definitive documents and court approval 
we have to resolve by negotiation or litigation additional claims of the qui tam relator and counsel  as well as the interests of the office of the inspector general of the department of health and human services in the matter 
during the year ended december   we recognized million of legal settlement expense related to the settlement 
during  we also incurred approximately million of expenses in responding to subpoenas and requests for information from governmental agencies 
during the year ended december   we recognized million of legal settlement costs 
these costs were the result of an independent arbitration award against the company in a lawsuit brought by jpd  inc and james p 
dicello  the sellers of northland medical pharmacy northland  which was purchased in late by chronimed holdings  inc chronimed  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
interest expense  net 
net interest expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million million for the same period in the increase in interest expense was due to a full year of interest in on the debt instruments primarily used to finance the chs acquisition 
interest expense for the year ended december  included million of interest expense related to our million of senior unsecured notes and million related to the million senior secured revolving credit facility 
loss on extinguishment of debt

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our outstanding debt 
at december   we had million of long term debt  of which million was subject to variable interest rates  and million of short term debt  of which was subject to variable interest rates 
we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily through our borrowing activities under the revolving credit facility  discussed in item of this report 
a one percent increase in current market interest rates would have approximately  impact on our annual net interest expense 
we do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and are not a party to any derivative financial instruments at this time 
management does not believe that our exposure to interest rate market risk is material at this time because the variable interest rate negotiated in the revolving credit facility is subject to a rate floor which is above current market rates 
market rates can increase and not cause an increase in our variable interest rate 
our revolving credit facility agreement provides for the use of interest rate swaps as a strategy to manage interest rate market risk 
we regularly assess the significance of interest rate market risk as part of our treasury operations and as circumstances change and will enter into interest rate swaps as appropriate 
at december   the carrying values of accounts receivable  accounts payable  claims payable  payables to plan sponsors and others approximate fair value due to their short term nature 
borrowings under our revolving credit facility include debt with variable interest rates totaling million at december  we believe the carrying value of our long term debt under our revolving credit facility approximates fair market value
