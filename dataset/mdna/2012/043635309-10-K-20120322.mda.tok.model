this discussion and analysis contains statements of a forward looking nature relating to future events or our future financial performance 
as a result of many factors  our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements

overview we are a development stage company formed to commercialize flexible pv modules using our proprietary technology 
for the year ended december   we generated approximately million of revenue 
our revenue from government research and development contracts was approximately million  and our revenue from product sales was approximately million 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
currently  we are in limited production based on our ability to create demand within emerging and specialty markets 
products in these markets carry higher average selling prices as compared to commodity markets 
we continue to qualify our equipment and we have adjusted our utilization of equipment based on our near term forecast 
in the near term we intend to focus on emerging and specialty markets with higher average selling prices  shifting our focus to rooftop applications in the longer term 
under our current business plan  we expect losses to continue until annual production reaches approximately mw or more 
we intend to augment our own manufacturing capabilities by licensing our proprietary manufacturing processes to others 
although we plan to continue manufacturing at our current facilities  our plans are also to have significant future production capacity enabled through partnerships  joint ventures or other commercial or licensing arrangements 
to date  we have financed our operations primarily through public and private equity financings 
throughout  we worked with dozens of customers in prototyping and developing applications for our products 
substantially all equipment necessary for production has been delivered as of december  our production volumes were based primarily on market demand for our products in emerging and specialty markets 
in march  based on market conditions  we revised our near term strategy to focus on applications for emerging and specialty markets  including off grid  military and defense and consumer oriented products  which we believe will better leverage the unique characteristics of our product and carry higher average selling prices 
our long term strategy is focused on these markets and the bipv bapv markets 
significant trends  uncertainties and challenges we believe that the significant trends  uncertainties and challenges that directly or indirectly affect our financial performance and results of operations include 
table of contents our ability to qualify production tools to achieve desired production yields  throughput  module efficiencies and other performance targets  and to obtain necessary or desired certifications for our pv modules  in a timely manner  our ability to maintain the listing of our common stock on the nasdaq global market or capital market and the potential impact of a possible delisting on the market liquidity and price volatility of our common stock  our ability to achieve projected operational performance and cost metrics  our ability to consummate strategic relationships with key partners  including oems  customers  system integrators  value added resellers and distributors who deal directly with manufacturers and end users in the bipv bapv  portable power  eipv and government defense solar panel markets  the availability of  or changes to  government policies  subsidies and incentives that effect the use or cost of renewable energy  consumer acceptance of and demand for our products  changes in the supply and demand for pv modules as well as fluctuations in selling prices for pv modules worldwide  our ability to raise additional capital on terms favorable to us  our ability to manage the planned expansion of our manufacturing facilities  operations and personnel  our ability to enter into commercially viable licensing  joint ventures or other commercial arrangements  our ability and the ability of our distributors  suppliers and customers to manage operations and orders and timely delivery of production tools  and availability of raw materials 
basis of presentation our activities to date have consisted substantially of raising capital  research and development  and establishment of our production operation 
revenues to date have been generated primarily from our governmental research and development contracts and have not been significant 
our planned principal operations to commercialize flexible pv modules have commenced  but have generated limited revenue to date 
accordingly  we are considered to be in the development stage and we have provided additional disclosure of inception to date activity in our statements of operations  statements of stockholder s equity and comprehensive income loss and statements of cash flows 
significant accounting policies investments we classify our investments as available for sale 
such investments are carried at fair value  based on quoted market prices with the unrealized holding gains and losses reported as accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the stockholders equity section of our balance sheets included herein 
realized gains and losses on sales of securities are computed using the specific identification method 
we evaluate declines in market value for potential impairment 
if the decline results in a value below cost and is determined to be other than temporary  the investment is written down to its impaired value and a new cost basis is established 
fair value estimates the fair value of an asset or liability is the amount at which it could be exchanged or settled in a current transaction between willing parties 
we have recorded investments at fair value and have classified them as level  or within the fair value hierarchy 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize data points that are observable such as quoted prices and other inputs that can be corroborated by observable market data 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize unobservable data points for the asset or liability 
in addition to the items measured at fair value on a recurring basis  in conjunction with the significant impairment loss taken in  we also measured certain property  plant and equipment at fair value on a nonrecurring basis 
these fair value measurements rely primarily on our specific inputs and assumptions about the use of the assets  as observable inputs are not available 
accordingly  we determined that these fair value measurements reside primarily within level of the fair value hierarchy 
the carrying value for cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash  accounts receivable  accounts payable  accrued property plant  and equipment  accrued expenses and other assets and liabilities approximate their fair values due to their short maturities 
revenue recognition revenue from governmental research and development contracts is generated under terms that are cost plus fee or firm fixed price 
revenue from cost plus fee contracts is recognized as costs are incurred on the basis of direct 
table of contents costs plus allowable indirect costs and an allocable portion of the fixed fee 
revenue from firm fixed price contracts is recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting  with costs and estimated profits included in contract revenue as work is performed 
if actual and estimated costs to complete a contract indicate a loss  provision is made currently for the loss anticipated on the contract 
revenue from commercial sales of flexible pv modules is recognized as modules are delivered and title has transferred to the customer 
product revenue through december  is included in research and development revenue as we are in the development stage and such revenues totaling  for the year ended december  were generated from a limited number of customers as the product is being brought to market 
inventories all inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined using the weighted average method 
elements of cost include raw material acquisition and conversion costs  an allocated portion of indirect production costs  inventory maintenance costs and depreciation and amortization 
when plant capacity is significantly underutilized  allocated costs included in inventories are based on a normal level of activity  with the excess costs charged to expense in the period incurred 
inventory balances are frequently evaluated to ensure that they do not exceed net realizable value 
the computation for net realizable value takes into account many factors  including expected demand  product lifecycle and development plans  module efficiency  quality issues  obsolescence and others 
if actual demand and market conditions are less favorable than those estimated by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
our inventories have a long life cycle and obsolescence is not a significant factor in their valuation 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment are recorded at the original cost to us 
assets are depreciated over estimated useful lives of three to forty years using the straight line method  as presented in the table below  commencing when the asset is placed in service 
leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the remainder of the lease term or the life of the improvements 
upon retirement or disposal  the cost of the asset disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in income 
expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred 
useful lives in years buildings manufacturing machinery and equipment furniture  fixtures  computer hardware software leasehold improvements life of lease long lived assets we analyze long lived tangible assets property  plant and equipment and definitive lived intangible assets patents for impairment by assessing if the asset cost will be recoverable 
events that might cause impairment would include significant current period operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of a long lived asset or group of assets combined with a history of such losses  significant changes in the manner of use of assets and significant negative industry or economic trends 
during and  we incurred significant impairments of our manufacturing facilities and equipment in the amounts of million and million  respectively  based on estimates prepared by management  as well as a valuation analysis by and independent firm 
research and development costs research and development costs are incurred during the process of researching and developing new products and enhancing our manufacturing processes and consist primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel  materials  supplies and equipment depreciation 
we expense these costs as incurred until the resulting product has been completed and tested and is ready for commercial manufacturing 
we also incur research and development expenses on federal government research and development contracts and expense as incurred 
share based compensation we measure and recognize compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees  officers  directors  and consultants based on estimated fair values 
we estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service period in our statements of operations included herein 
share based compensation is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and is reduced for estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  as necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
for purposes of determining estimated fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant  we use the black scholes option pricing model black scholes model for option awards 
the black scholes model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions 
because our employee stock options may have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  in management s opinion  the existing models may not provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our employee stock 
table of contents options 
management will continue to assess the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate estimated fair value of share based compensation 
circumstances may change and additional data may become available over time  which result in changes to these assumptions and methodologies  which could materially impact our fair value determination 
we estimate the fair value of our restricted stock awards at our stock price on the grant date 
the accounting guidance for share based compensation may be subject to further interpretation and refinement over time 
there are significant differences among option valuation models  and this may result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the accounting for share based compensation in future periods  or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the compensation expense that we record in the future may differ significantly from what it has recorded in the current period and could materially affect our loss from operations  net loss and net loss per share 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued asu  fair value measurement topic topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs 
this accounting standards update asu provides a consistent definition of fair value and sets forth common requirements for measurement of and disclosure about fair value in accordance with us gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs 
asu amends existing fair value measurement and disclosure requirements including application of highest and best use and valuation premise concepts  measuring the fair value of an instrument classified in a reporting entity s shareholders equity  measuring the fair value of financial instruments that are valued within a portfolio and disclosures in measurement categorized within level of the fair value hierarchy 
this asu is effective on a prospective basis during interim and annual periods beginning after december  and early application is not permitted 
we do not expect the adoption of asu will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued asu  comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income 
this asu seeks to improve comparability  consistency and transparency of financial reporting with respect to comprehensive income by eliminating the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity  among other amendments 
the amendments of this asu require all non owner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or two separate but consecutive statements 
this asu is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december  and early adoption is permitted 
the adoption of asu will affect only financial statement presentation and will not impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows

we also had approximately million in restricted cash securing equipment purchases which is included in other assets on our balance sheets included herein 
we have remaining obligations for equipment purchases in the approximate amount of million  of which approximately million is recorded in accrued property  plant and equipment 
on march   we announced a change in strategy that  in the near term  will focus our solar module technology on applications for emerging and specialty markets 
longer term we intend to participate in the building integrated market 
the change in strategy resulted in a change in leadership and sizing the company to a new cost structure  primarily through the termination of a portion of our workforce 
we incurred a charge of approximately  in the quarter ended march  
table of contents  comprised of severance costs 
this charge has been expensed as research and development and selling  general and administrative in our accompanying statements of operations in the amounts of approximately  and  respectively 
approximately  is recorded under accrued expenses in our balance sheets as of december  included herein 
due to recent significant adverse changes in market conditions  particularly the decreases in current and expected average selling prices for pv modules  we concluded in the quarter ended june  that the carrying value of property  plant and equipment and deposits on manufacturing equipment may not be recoverable and a non cash impairment charge of approximately million was recorded 
the use of cash for operational expenses averaged approximately million per month during the quarter ended december  compared to approximately million per month during the quarter ended march   the date of the change in strategy  which reflects a decrease of approximately million per month 
cash used for operational expenses is related to manufacturing and engineering activities  research and development  business development and general corporate expenses 
as of december   we had full time employees and contractors provided through an employment services provider 
we expect our current cash balance to be sufficient to cover our planned capital and operational expenditures through december  based on currently known factors and limited projected revenues 
we expect that we may need to raise additional capital to cover our operating losses and future manufacturing capacity expansion 
the capital markets are currently volatile and there is no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital on acceptable terms or at all 
we currently are pursuing various avenues to obtain additional capital for further expansion 
for the twelve months ended december   our cash used in operations was approximately million compared to approximately million for the twelve months ended december   a decrease of million 
the decrease in cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in was primarily due to a decrease in net loss after deducting non cash adjustments  decrease in inventory purchases and net decrease in other assets 
partially offsetting the decrease in cash used in operations was a net decrease in other liabilities and increase in foreign currency transaction gain 
the total net change in cash and cash equivalents for the year ended december  was a decrease of approximately million 
the decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily the result of i negative cash from operating activities of approximately million  primarily as a result of net loss adjusted for non cash expenses and other items such as depreciation and amortization  non cash based stock based compensation  impairment on property  plant and equipment and cancellation fees and forfeited deposits on equipment  increases in inventories and decreases in other liabilities  partially offset by decreases in other assets  and ii negative cash from investing activities of approximately million as a result of purchases of plant  property and equipment  partially offset by net purchases and maturities of available for sale securities and cash restricted for purchasing of manufacturing equipment 
the decrease in cash and cash equivalents was partially offset by cash received from financing activities of approximately million 
the primary source of cash within financing activities was approximately million in proceeds from sale of common stock  including approximately million in net proceeds received from the august sale of stock to tfg radiant

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk historically  we have purchased manufacturing equipment internationally  which exposes us to foreign currency risk 
in july and march  we entered into fair value hedges utilizing forward contracts designed to match scheduled contractual payments to equipment suppliers  which are payments denominated in euros and yen 
the total notional value of the euro forward contracts was million with various contract settlement dates beginning september  through july  the total notional value of the yen forward contracts was million with contract settlement dates of march and april those forward contracts had been settled as of december  and the currencies contracted for were delivered to us 
however  not all payments have been made to our equipment suppliers  and we continue to have foreign currency risk 
included in restricted cash is  related to  held as of december  in our bank account for future payments to equipment suppliers 
based on our overall currency rate exposure as of december   a near term appreciation or depreciation in the us dollar  relative to our foreign currencies on deposit  would have a positive or negative impact of approximately million on our results of operations 
although our reporting currency is the us dollar  we may conduct business and incur costs in the local currencies of other countries in which we may operate  make sales and buy materials 
as a result  we are subject to currency translation risk 
further  changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar could affect our future net sales and cost of sales and could result in exchange losses 
generally  our objective is to fix the dollar amount of our foreign currency denominated manufacturing equipment purchases at the time of order 
although our hedging activity described below is designed to fix the dollar amount to be 
table of contents expended  the asset purchased is recorded at the spot foreign currency rate in effect as of the date of the payment to the supplier 
the difference between the spot rate and the forward rate has been reported as gain or loss on forward contract 
we cannot accurately predict future exchange rates or the overall impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risks for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash equivalents and investment portfolio 
as of december   our cash equivalents consisted of money market funds  investments in us government securities and high quality corporate securities 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and provide liquidity on demand  while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
the direct risk to us associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio  and we do not believe that a change in interest rates will have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
credit risk we have certain financial and derivative instruments that potentially subject us to credit risk 
these consist primarily of cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash  investments  and forward foreign currency option contracts 
we are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counter parties to our financial and derivative instruments 
we place cash  cash equivalents  investments and forward foreign currency option contracts with various high quality financial institutions  and exposure is limited at any one institution 
we continuously evaluate the credit standing of our counter party financial institutions
