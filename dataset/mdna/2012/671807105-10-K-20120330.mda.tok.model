item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion of financial condition as of december  and and results of operations for each of the years in the two year period ended december  should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto  included in this report 
average balances  including balances used in calculating certain financial ratios  are generally comprised of average daily balances 
forward looking statements this discussion of financial results includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  the act and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  the act 
those sections of the act and act provide a safe harbor for forward looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information about their financial performance so long as they provide meaningful  cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ significantly from projected results 
our forward looking statements include descriptions of plans or objectives of management for future operations  products or services  and forecasts of our revenues  earnings or other measures of economic performance 
forward looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 
they often include the words believe  expect  intend  estimate or words of similar meaning  or future or conditional verbs such as will  would  should  could or may 
forward looking statements are based on management s current expectations regarding economic  legislative  and regulatory issues that may impact our earnings in future periods 
a number of factors many of which are beyond management s control could cause future results to vary materially from current management s expectations 
such factors include  but are not limited to  general economic conditions  the current financial turmoil in the united states and abroad  changes in interest rates  deposit flows  real estate values and industry competition  changes in accounting principles  policies or guidelines  changes in legislation or regulation  and other economic  competitive  governmental  regulatory and technological factors affecting our operations  pricing  products and services 
forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made 
we do not undertake to update forward looking statements to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the date the forward looking statements are made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 

table of contents introduction our continued focus on responsible community banking fundamentals and our strong customer relationships have enabled us to increase profitability in  and have led to higher deposits  a core funding source for our steady asset growth 
as of december   we had approximately million in total assets  million in total gross loans  and million in total deposits 
we believe the following were key indicators of our performance for operations during our total assets increased to million at the end of  an increase of  from million at the end of our total deposits increased to million at the end of  an increase of  from million at the end of our total net loans decreased to million at the end of  a decrease of  from million at the end of our ratio of total non performing loans to total loans decreased to at december  from at december  management considers that the size of the ratio of non performing assets to total loans is moderate and manageable  and reserves have been taken appropriately 
net interest income increased million or in compared to  mainly as a result of an increase in average earning assets of million 
provision for loan losses decreased million or to million in compared to million in total noninterest income decreased to million in  a decrease of  from million in despite expanding our deposit account base  there were various offsetting factors that contributed to the nominal decrease 
total noninterest expense increased from million in to million in  reflecting the increase in overhead costs associated with two new branch openings in these items  as well as other factors  contributed to the increase in net income available to common shareholders for to million from million in  which translates into per diluted common share in and per diluted common share in over the past few years  our network of branches and loan production offices has been expanded geographically 
we currently maintain fourteen full service offices 
we intend to continue our growth strategy in future years through the opening of additional branches and loan production offices as our needs and resources permit 
outlook as we begin our strategic business plan for  we are continuing to pursue opportunities for growth in our existing markets  as well as opportunities to expand into new markets through de novo branching 
further  we expect that our portfolio of small business loans will overall experience additional growth in as a result of targeted marketing efforts in this area 
in  we are continuing to focus on loan and account growth and managing our net interest margin  while attempting to control expenses and credit losses and manage our business to achieve our net income and other objectives 
efforts to attract new accounts and grow loans continue to be an important strategic initiative 
although interest rates remained flat at historic lows in  we had strong growth in our earning assets to increase our net interest income  which we expect could slightly compress in if interest rates begin to increase 
the potential compression of net interest income and net interest margin would be a likely outcome if interest rates increase given that are balance sheet is liability sensitive to interest rate changes primarily due to the number of loans currently at their contractual rate floors and competitive pressures to increase deposit rates 
this could in turn result in a slower increase on the yield of earning assets compared to the cost of deposits and other funds 
ideally  if we experience an increase in our yield on earnings assets we could then determine to increase the interest rates we pay on our deposit accounts or change our promotional or other interest rates on new deposits in marketing activation programs to attempt to achieve a certain net interest margin 
in light of the current economic environment  it may not be possible to manage the interest margin in this manner  as competitive pressures may dictate that we increase deposit rates at a faster rate than the earning assets increase  thereby further compressing the net interest margin 
any increases in the rates we charge on accounts could 
table of contents have an effect on our efforts to attract new customers and grow loans  particularly with the continuing competition in the commercial and consumer lending industry 
the economies and real estate markets in our primary market areas will continue to be significant determinants of the quality of our assets in future periods and  thus  our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
current economic indicators suggest that the national economy and the economies in our primary market areas will remain depressed but the length and severity of the cycle is difficult to predict 
for  management remains focused on the above challenges and opportunities and other factors affecting the business similar to the factors driving results as discussed in this section 
holding company effective july   oak valley community bank became a subsidiary of oak valley bancorp  a newly established bank holding company 
oak valley bancorp operates oak valley community bank as a community bank in the general commercial banking business  with our primary market encompassing the california central valley around oakdale and modesto  and the eastern sierras 
as such  unless otherwise noted  all references are about oak valley bancorp 
in the bank holding company reorganization  all outstanding shares of common stock of the bank were exchanged for an equal number of shares of common stock of oak valley bancorp  which now owns the bank as its wholly owned subsidiary 
management believes that operating the bank within a holding company structure  among other things provides greater operating flexibility than is currently enjoyed by us 
facilitates the acquisition of related businesses as opportunities arise 
improves our ability to diversify 
enhances our ability to remain competitive in the future with other companies in the financial services industry that are organized in a holding company structure 
enhances our ability to raise capital to support growth 
the financial statements and discussion thereof contained in this report for periods subsequent to the reorganization relate to the consolidated financial statements of oak valley bancorp 
periods prior to the reorganization relate to the bank only 
the information is comparable as the sole subsidiary of oak valley bancorp is the bank 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that effect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
in addition  gaap itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method  although the economics of our transactions would be the same 
management has determined the following accounting policies to be critical asset impairment judgments certain of our assets are carried in our consolidated balance sheets at fair value or at the lower of cost or fair value 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to recognize impairment of such assets 
we periodically perform analyses to test for impairment of various assets 
in addition to our impairment analyses related to loans  another significant impairment analysis relates to other than temporary declines in the value of our securities 
our available for sale portfolio is carried at estimated fair value  with any unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes  reported as accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
we conduct a periodic review and evaluation of the securities portfolio to determine if the value of any security has declined below its carrying value and whether such decline is other than 
table of contents temporary 
if such decline is deemed other than temporary  we would adjust the carrying amount of the security by writing down the security to fair value through a charge to current period income 
the market values of our securities are significantly affected by changes in interest rates 
in general  as interest rates rise  the market value of fixed rate securities will decrease  as interest rates fall  the market value of fixed rate securities will increase 
with significant changes in interest rates  we evaluate our intent and ability to hold the security for a sufficient time to recover the recorded principal balance 
estimated fair values for securities are based on published or securities dealers market values 
market volatility is unpredictable and may impact such values 
allowance for loan losses credit risk is inherent in the business of lending and making commercial loans 
accounting for our allowance for loan losses involves significant judgment and assumptions by management and is based on historical data and management s view of the current economic environment 
at least on a quarterly basis  our management reviews the methodology and adequacy of allowance for loan losses and reports its assessment to the board of directors for its review and approval 
the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of probable incurred losses with regard to our loans 
our loan loss provision for each period is dependent upon many factors  including loan growth  net charge offs  changes in the composition of the loans  delinquencies  management s assessment of the quality of the loans  the valuation of problem loans and the general economic conditions in our market area 
we base our allowance for loan losses on an estimation of probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
our methodology for assessing loan loss allowances are intended to reduce the differences between estimated and actual losses and involves a detailed analysis of our loan portfolio  in three phases the specific review of individual loans  the segmenting and review of loan pools with similar characteristics  and our judgmental estimate based on various subjective factors the first phase of our methodology involves the specific review of individual loans to identify and measure impairment 
we evaluate each loan by use of a risk rating system  except for homogeneous loans  such as automobile loans and home mortgages 
specific risk rated loans are deemed impaired if all amounts  including principal and interest  will likely not be collected in accordance with the contractual terms of the related loan agreement 
impairment for commercial and real estate loans is measured either based on the present value of the loan s expected future cash flows or  if collection on the loan is collateral dependent  the estimated fair value of the collateral  less selling and holding costs 
the second phase involves the segmenting of the remainder of the risk rated loan portfolio into groups or pools of loans  together with loans with similar characteristics  for evaluation 
we determine the calculated loss ratio to each loan pool based on its historical net losses and benchmark it against the levels of other peer banks 
in the third phase  we consider relevant internal and external factors that may affect the collectability of loan portfolio and each group of loan pool 
the factors considered are  but are not limited to concentration of credits  nature and volume of the loan portfolio  delinquency trends  non accrual loan trend  problem loan trend  loss and recovery trend  quality of loan review  
table of contents lending and management staff  lending policies and procedures  economic and business conditions  and other external factors 
our management estimates the probable effect of such conditions based on our judgment  experience and known or anticipated trends 
such estimation may be reflected as an additional allowance to each group of loans  if necessary 
management reviews these conditions with our senior credit officers 
to the extent that any of these conditions is evidenced by a specifically identifiable problem credit or portfolio segment as of the evaluation date  management s estimate of the effect of such condition may be reflected as a specific allowance applicable to such credit or portfolio segment 
where any of these conditions is not evidenced by a specific  identifiable problem credit or portfolio segment as of the evaluation date  management s evaluation of the inherent loss related to such condition is reflected in the unallocated allowance 
central to our credit risk management and our assessment of appropriate loss allowance is our loan risk rating system 
under this system  the originating credit officer assigns borrowers an initial risk rating based on a thorough analysis of each borrower s financial capacity in conjunction with industry and economic trends 
approvals are made based upon the amount of inherent credit risk specific to the transaction and are reviewed for appropriateness by senior line and credit administration personnel 
credits are monitored by line and credit administration personnel for deterioration in a borrower s financial condition which may impact the ability of the borrower to perform under the contract 
although management has allocated a portion of the allowance to specific loans  specific loan pools  and off balance sheet credit exposures which are reported separately as part of other liabilities  the adequacy of the allowance is considered in its entirety 
it is the policy of management to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level adequate for risks inherent in the overall loan portfolio  however  the loan portfolio can be adversely affected if the state of california s economic conditions and its real estate market in our general market area were to further deteriorate or weaken 
additionally  further weakness of a prolonged nature in the agricultural and general economy would have a negative impact on the local market 
the effect of such economic events  although uncertain and unpredictable at this time  could result in an increase in the levels of nonperforming loans and additional loan losses  which could adversely affect our future growth and profitability 
no assurance of the level of predicted credit losses can be given with any certainty 
non accrual loan policy interest on loans is credited to income as earned and is accrued only if deemed collectible 
accrual of interest is discontinued when a loan is over days delinquent or if management believes that collection is highly uncertain 
generally  payments received on nonaccrual loans are recorded as principal reductions 
interest income is recognized after all principal has been repaid or an improvement in the condition of the loan has occurred that would warrant resumption of interest accruals 
stock based compensation the company recognizes in the consolidated statements of income the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based forms of compensation issued to employees over the employees requisite service period generally the vesting period 
the company uses straight line recognition of expenses for awards with graded vesting 
the company utilizes a binomial pricing model for all stock option grants 
expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the price of the company s stock 
the company uses historical data to estimate option exercise and stock option forfeiture rates within the valuation model 
the expected term of options granted for the binomial model is derived from applying a historical suboptimal exercise factor to the contractual term of the grant 
for binomial pricing  the risk free rate for periods is equal to the us treasury yield at the time of grant and commensurate with the contractual term of the grant 
for restricted stock grants  the company uses the market price of the stock on the grant date and expenses the market value over the vesting period 

table of contents income taxes deferred income taxes are provided for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the company s assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected at currently enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled using the liability method 
as changes in tax laws or rates are enacted  deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes 
the company files income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction  and the state of california 
with few exceptions  the company is no longer subject to us federal or state local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before deferred compensations plans future compensation under the company s executive salary continuation plan and director retirement plan is earned for services rendered through retirement 
the company accrues for the salary continuation liability based on anticipated years of service and vesting schedules provided under the plans 
the company s current benefit liability is determined based on vesting and the present value of the benefits at a corresponding discount rate 
the discount rate used is an equivalent rate for investment grade bonds with lives matching those of the service periods remaining for the salary continuation contracts  which average approximately years 
fair value measurements we use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures 
we base our fair values on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
securities available for sale  derivatives  and loans held for sale  if any  are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis 
additionally  from time to time  we may be required to record certain assets at fair value on a non recurring basis  such as certain impaired loans held for investment and securities held to maturity that are other than temporarily impaired 
these non recurring fair value adjustments typically involve write downs of individual assets due to application of lower of cost or market accounting 
we have established and documented a process for determining fair value 
we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements 
whenever there is no readily available market data  management uses its best estimate and assumptions in determining fair value  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
as a result  if other assumptions had been used  our recorded earnings or disclosures could have been materially different from those reflected in these financial statements 
for detailed information on our use of fair value measurements and our related valuation methodologies  see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k

 receivables topic a creditor s determination of whether a restructuring is a troubled debt restructuring 
the asu clarifies which loan modifications constitute troubled debt restructurings 
it is intended to assist creditors in determining whether a modification of the terms of a receivable meets the criteria to be considered a troubled debt restructuring tdr  both for purposes of recording an impairment loss and for disclosure of a tdr 
in evaluating whether a restructuring constitutes a tdr  a creditor must separately conclude that both of the following exist a the restructuring constitutes a concession  and b the debtor is experiencing financial difficulties 
the amendments to asu topic  receivables  clarify the guidance on a creditor s evaluation of whether it has granted a concession and whether a debtor is experiencing financial difficulties 
asu no

the asu improves the comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrss by changing the wording used to describe many of the requirements in u 
s gaap for measuring fair value and disclosure of information 
the amendments to this asu provide explanation on how to measure fair value but do not require any additional fair value measurements and does not establish valuation standards or affect valuation practices 
table of contents outside of financial reporting 
the amendments clarify existing fair value measurements and disclosure requirements to include application of the highest and best use and valuation premises concepts  measuring fair value of an instrument classified in a reporting entity s shareholders equity  and disclosures requirements regarding quantitative information about unobservable inputs categorized within level of the fair value hierarchy 
in addition  clarification is provided for measuring the fair value of financial instruments that are managed in a portfolio and the application of premiums and discounts in a fair value measurement 
for public entities  asu is effective during interim and annual periods beginning after december  we do not expect this asu to have a significant impact on our financial condition or result of operations 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income 
the asu improves the comparability  consistency  and transparency of financial reporting and increases the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income 
the amendments to topic  comprehensive income  require entities to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
entities are no longer permitted to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
any adjustments for items are that reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income are to be presented on the face of the entities financial statement regardless the method of presentation for comprehensive income 
the amendments do not change items to be reported in comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income  nor do the amendments change the option to present the components of other comprehensive income either net of related tax effects or before related tax effects

the asu requires an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position 
the amendments are effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning on or after january  the company is currently in the process of evaluating the asu but does not expect it will have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the company earns income from two primary sources 
the first is net interest income  which is interest income generated by earning assets less interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
the second is noninterest income  which primarily consists of deposit service charges and fees  the increase in cash surrender value of life insurance and mortgage commissions 
the majority of the company s noninterest expenses are operating costs that relate to providing a full range of banking services to our customers 
overview we recorded net income available to common shareholders for the year ended december  of  or per diluted common share compared to  or per diluted common share for the year ended december  the increase in net income available to common shareholders for the year ended december  was primarily due to a decrease of  in provision for loan losses  an increase in net interest income of  partially offsetting these factors was a decrease in non interest income of  an increase of  in non interest expense associated with two new branch openings in and an increase in income tax provision of

our net interest income is affected by changes in the level and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  referred to as volume changes 
our net interest income is also affected by changes in the yields earned on assets and rates paid on liabilities  referred to as rate changes 
interest rates charged on our loans are affected principally by the demand for such loans  the supply of money available for lending purposes and competitive factors 
those factors are  in turn  affected by general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control  such as federal economic policies  the general supply of money in the economy  legislative tax policies  the governmental budgetary matters  and the actions of the federal reserve board

table of contents interest earning deposits in bank balances of million which are earning and thus driving down the overall yield on earning assets 
the current low market interest rate environment has had a positive impact on net interest income in previous years because the company s balance sheet is liability sensitive which typically results in our average cost of funds decreasing faster than the average yield on interest earning assets in a declining rate environment 
in  we have not recognized this benefit to the same degree  as deposit interest rates are at historic lows and have essentially reached a threshold in which they cannot reasonably be further reduced 
however  the total cost of funds did decrease basis points in compared to  due in part to a shift from high cost cds and fhlb borrowed funds into demand deposit and money market accounts 
in addition  average non interest bearing demand deposit balances increased by million in compared to  further reducing our cost of funds 
compared to cost of funds  the decrease in earning asset yield was more significant at basis points in compared to the investment securities portfolio recognized the most significant decrease of basis points in  mainly because of the company deploying cash into investment security purchases  which have historically low yields 
the yield on loans has remained more stable  with a reduction of basis points for compared to  partly as a result of the significant portion of our loans that are at their contractual rate floors 
in addition  the large majority of our variable loans are tied to the us treasury constant maturity indices with repricing intervals between one and five years

provision for loan losses credit risk is inherent in the business of making loans 
the company establishes an allowance for loan losses through charges to earnings  which are shown in the statements of operations as the provision for loan losses 
specifically identifiable and quantifiable losses are promptly charged off against the allowance 
the company maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level that it considers to be adequate to provide for credit losses inherent in its loan portfolio 
management determines the level of the allowance by performing a quarterly analysis that considers concentrations of credit  past loss experience  current economic conditions  the amount and composition of the loan portfolio including nonperforming and potential problem loans  estimated fair value of underlying collateral  and other information relevant to assessing the risk of loss inherent in the loan portfolio such as for example loan growth  net charge offs  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  and delinquencies 
as a result of management s analysis  a range of the potential amount of the allowance for loan losses is determined 
the provision for loan losses was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year end december  nonperforming loans were million at december  and million at december   or and  respectively  of total loans 
nonperforming loans are primarily in nonperforming real estate construction and development loans 
the allowance for loan losses was million and million at december  and  or and  respectively  of total loans 
net charge offs were  in compared to  in the relatively high 
table of contents level of net charge offs for and as compared to all prior years was primarily due to the economic downturn and the effect on the housing market 
the company will continue to monitor the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and make additions to the allowance in accordance with the analysis referred to above 
because of uncertainties inherent in estimating the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses  actual results may differ from management s estimate of credit losses and the related allowance 
noninterest income noninterest income was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year in  other income decreased by  which was partially attributable to a checking cash back reward program expense accrual of  posted to other income as a contra account which offset the increase of  in bank debit card fees 
also contributing to the decrease in noninterest income was a decrease of  in rental income on banked owned properties and a decrease of  from gains on called available for sale securities  as compared to service charge income increased to million for the year compared to million for the year as a result of the increase in the aggregate number of deposit accounts of to  at december   as compared to  accounts as of december  the company continues to evaluate its deposit product offerings with the intention of continuing to expand its offerings to the consumer and business depositors

the two new branches also resulted in an increase of  in occupancy expenses in compared to  primarily from building lease expense and building depreciation  as one of the branches was leased on the other was purchased 
data processing costs increased in over by  reflecting the additional costs that related to the increased number of deposit accounts 
other expenses recognized an increase in compared to of  as a result of overhead expenses from our new branches and various costs associated with the expansion of products and services 
oreo expenses decreased by  to  in  compared to  in included within these totals are oreo write downs of  in compared to  in the remaining expense included in oreo expenses is attributed to general overhead such as property taxes and utilities associated with the properties classified as other real estate owned 
there was one sale of an oreo property recorded in which reduced our oreo inventory from three properties as of december  to two properties as of december  the company did not acquire any additional oreo during fdic and dfi california department of financial institutions regulatory assessments decreased by  to  in compared to  in the initial base assessment rate for financial institutions varies based on the overall risk profile of the institution as defined by the fdic 
the decrease in is due to a lower base assessment rate as the company has improved its overall risk ratings 
the decrease in expense was in spite of a higher deposit base in as compared to  as the fdic assessment rates are applied to average quarterly deposits as the primary basis 
management anticipates that noninterest expense will continue to increase as we continue to grow  even though management also estimates that the company s administration as currently set up may be scalable to handle a larger deposit base of up to around b in deposits 
however  management remains committed to cost control and efficiency  and we expect to keep these increases to a minimum relative to growth 

table of contents provision for income taxes we reported a provision for income taxes of  and  for the years and respectively 
the effective income tax rate on income from continuing operations was for the year ended december  compared to for the year these provisions reflect accruals for taxes at the applicable rates for federal income tax and california franchise tax based upon reported pre tax income  and adjusted for the effects of all permanent differences between income for tax and financial reporting purposes such as earnings on qualified municipal securities  boli and certain tax exempt loans 
the disparity between the effective tax rates in as compared to is primarily due to tax credits from california enterprise zones and low income housing projects as well as tax free income on loans within these enterprise zones and municipal securities and loans that comprise a larger proportion of pre tax income in as compared to we have not been subject to an alternative minimum tax amt during these periods 
financial condition the company s total assets were million at december  compared to million at december   an increase of million or 
net loans decreased million  investments increased million  bank premises and equipment increased million and interest receivable and other assets decreased million  while cash and cash equivalents increased million for the year ended december  as compared to december  loans gross of the allowance for loan losses and deferred fees were million at december   compared to million at december   a decrease of million or 
the decrease was primarily due to a decrease of million or in commercial real estate loans and a decrease of million in agriculture loans 
these were offset by increases of million in commercial and industrial loans and an increase of million in consumer loans and consumer residential loans 
the composition of the loan portfolio categories remained relatively unchanged as a percentage of total loans  except for agriculture loans which recognized the highest change from at december  to at december  deposits increased million or to million at december  compared to million at december  all deposit types increased except for time deposits which decreased by million 
all other deposits increased  including demand deposit accounts which recognized a million increase 
money market  now and savings each increased by million  million and million  respectively 
short term borrowings decreased million to million at december   compared to million at december  and long term debt decreased from million at december  to zero at december  the decrease in short term and long term debt was due to the deposit growth of million 
this allowed us to pay off matured fhlb advances thus reducing our cost of funds and improving our liquidity ratio 
the company uses short term borrowings  primarily short term fhlb advances  to fund short term liquidity needs and manage net interest margin 
equity increased million or to million at december   compared to million at december  the company was selected to participate in the us treasury capital purchase program tcpp which resulted in the issuance of million in preferred stock in december in august  the company repurchased these series a preferred stock shares and simultaneously issued  in series b preferred stock to the us treasury under the small business lending funding sblf program 
subsequently  the company fully redeemed a warrant to purchase  shares of its common stock  at the exercise price of per share that the company had granted to the us treasury pursuant to the tcpp  for a purchase price of  which settled in september so long as the preferred stock remains outstanding under sblf  it will pay quarterly cumulative dividends at a variable rate between and per year for the first years depending on growth of our small business loan portfolio 
if there is no loan growth after years  the dividend rate could increase to and if the preferred stock remains outstanding after years  the rate increases to  regardless of loan growth 
the company intends to use the capital to increase credit availability to local  creditworthy  businesses and consumers

investment activities investments are a key source of interest income 
management of our investment portfolio is set in accordance with strategies developed and overseen by our investment committee 
investment balances  including cash equivalents and interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions  are subject to change over time based on our asset liability funding needs and interest rate risk management objectives

we have historically targeted well established local businesses with strong guarantors that have proven to be resilient in periods of economic stress 
our residential loan portfolio includes no sub prime loans  nor is it our normal practice to underwrite loans commonly referred to as alt a mortgages  the characteristics of which are loans lacking full documentation  borrowers having low fico scores or collateral compositions reflecting high loan to value ratios

nonperforming assets financial institutions generally have a certain level of exposure to credit quality risk  and could potentially receive less than a full return of principal and interest if a debtor becomes unable or unwilling to repay 
since loans are the most significant assets of the company and generate the largest portion of its revenues  the company s management of credit quality risk is focused primarily on loan quality 
banks have generally suffered their most severe earnings declines as a result of customers inability to generate sufficient cash flow to service their debts and or downturns in national and regional economies which have brought about declines in overall property values 
in addition  certain debt securities that the company may purchase have the potential of declining in value if the obligor s financial capacity to repay deteriorates 
nonperforming assets consist of loans on non accrual status  loans days or more past due and still accruing interest  loans restructured  where the terms of repayment have been renegotiated resulting in a reduction or deferral of interest or principal and other real estate owned oreo 
loans are generally placed on non accrual status when they become days past due  unless management believes the loan is adequately collateralized and in the process of collection 
the past due loans may or may not be adequately collateralized  but collection efforts are continuously pursued 
loans may be restructured by management when a borrower has experienced some changes in financial status  causing an inability to meet the original repayment terms  and where we believe the borrower will eventually overcome those circumstances and repay the loan in full 
oreo consists of properties acquired by foreclosure or similar means and which management intends to offer for sale 

table of contents the company had nonperforming loans of million at december   as compared to million at december   million at december   million at december  and million at december  the ratio of nonperforming loans over total loans was    and at december     and  respectively

except as disclosed above  as of december   management was not aware of any material credit problems of borrowers that would cause it to have serious doubts about the ability of a borrower to comply with the present loan payment terms 
however  no assurance can be given that credit problems may exist that may not have been brought to the attention of management  or that credit problems may arise

a restructured loan is one the terms of which were renegotiated to provide a reduction or deferral of interest or principal because of deterioration in the financial position of the borrower 

table of contents allowance for loan losses in anticipation of credit risk inherent in our lending business  we set aside allowances through charges to earnings 
such charges are not only made for the outstanding loan portfolio  but also for off balance sheet items  such as commitments to extend credits or letters of credit 
the charges made for the outstanding loan portfolio are credited to the allowance for loan losses  whereas charges for off balance sheet items are credited to the reserve for off balance sheet items  which is presented as a component of other liabilities 
the provision for loan losses is discussed in the section entitled provision for loan losses above 
the balance of our allowance for loan losses is management s best estimate of the remaining losses inherent in the portfolio 
the ultimate adequacy of the allowance is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control  including the real estate market  changes in interest rate and economic and political environments 
the current stagnant economic condition combined with growth of our loan portfolio in the past five years has required more reserves for probable loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses increased by  or  to million at december  as compared with million at december  such allowances were million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
due to loan growth and the current economic downturn s effect on the financial stability of certain borrowers  the loan loss allowances have increased to maintain an adequate reserve as a percentage of total loans  as reflected in the ratios of    and  at the end of    and  respectively 
based on the current conditions of the loan portfolio  management believes that the million allowance for loan losses at december  is adequate to absorb losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
no assurance can be given  however  that adverse economic conditions or other circumstances will not result in increased losses in the portfolio 
in light of the current weakness in the economic environment  and specifically in the real estate construction sector  reserves have been increased to recognize such increased risk 
diversification  low loan to values  strong credit quality and enhanced credit monitoring contribute to a reduction in the portfolio s overall risk  and help to offset the economic risk 
the impact of the increasing economic weakness will continue to be monitored  and adjustments to the provision for loan loss will be made accordingly 
the weak business climate adversely impacted the financial conditions of some of our clients and resulted in net loan charge offs of     and  in    and  respectively 
management reviews these conditions with our senior credit officers 
to the extent that any of these conditions is evidenced by a specifically identifiable problem credit or portfolio segment as of the evaluation date  management s estimate of the effect of such condition may be reflected as a specific allowance applicable to such credit or portfolio segment 
where any of these conditions is not evidenced by a specific  identifiable problem credit or portfolio segment as of the evaluation date  management s evaluation of the inherent loss related to such condition is reflected in the unallocated allowance 
although management has allocated a portion of the allowance to specific loan categories  the adequacy of the allowance is considered in its entirety 
although management believes the allowance at december  was adequate to absorb losses from any known and inherent risks in the portfolio  no assurance can be given that economic conditions which adversely affect our service areas or other variables will not result in increased losses in the loan portfolio in the future 
as of december   our allowance for loan losses consisted of amounts allocated to three phases of our methodology for assessing loan loss allowances  as follows see details of methodology for assessing allowance for loan losses in the section entitled critical accounting policies years ended december  phase of methodology dollars in thousands specific review of individual loans review of pools of loans with similar characteristics judgmental estimate based on various subjective factors 
table of contents the components of the allowance for loan losses as stated previously in critical accounting policies  the overall allowance consists of a specific allowance for individually identified impaired loans  an allowance factor for categories of credits with similar characteristics and trends  and an allowance for changing environmental factors 
the first component  the specific allowance  results from the analysis of identified problem credits and the evaluation of sources of repayment including collateral  as applicable 
through management s ongoing loan grading process  individual loans are identified that have conditions that indicate the borrower may be unable to pay all amounts due under the contractual terms 
these loans are evaluated individually by management and specified allowances for loan losses are established when the discounted cash flows of future payments or collateral value of collateral dependent loans are lower than the recorded investment in the loan 
generally with problem credits that are collateral dependent  we obtain appraisals of the collateral at least annually 
we may obtain appraisals more frequently if we believe the collateral value is subject to market volatility  if a specific event has occurred to the collateral eg tentative map has been filed  or if we believe foreclosure is imminent 
impaired loan balances decreased from million at december  to million at december  the specific allowance totaled  and  at december  and  respectively  as we charge off substantially all of our estimated losses related to specifically identified impaired loans as the losses are identified 
the second component  the allowance factor  is an estimate of the probable inherent losses in each loan pool stratified by major categories or loans with similar characteristics in our loan portfolio 
this analysis encompasses segmenting and reviewing loan grades by pool and current general economic and business conditions 
confirmation of the quality of our grading process is obtained by independent reviews conducted by consultants specifically hired for this purpose and by various bank regulatory agencies 
this analysis covers our entire loan portfolio but excludes any loans that were analyzed individually for specific allowances as discussed above 
there are limitations to any credit risk grading process 
the number of loans makes it impractical to review every loan every quarter 
therefore  it is possible that in the future some currently performing loans not recently graded will not be as strong as their last grading and an insufficient portion of the allowance will have been allocated to them 
grading and loan review often must be done without knowing whether all relevant facts are at hand 
troubled borrowers may deliberately or inadvertently omit important information from reports or conversations with lending officers regarding their financial condition and the diminished strength of repayment sources 
the total amount allocated for the second component is determined by applying loss estimation factors to outstanding loans 
at december  and  the allowance allocated by categories of credits totaled million and million  respectively 
the increase mainly related to increased allowance factors for land loans related to the construction of residential subdivisions  commercial quick qualifier loans and manufactured home loans  recognizing increased risk for these types of loans  as well as loan growth 
the third component of the allowance for loan losses is an economic component that is not allocated to specific loans or groups of loans  but rather is intended to absorb losses caused by portfolio trends  concentration of credit  growth  and economic trends  as stated previously in critical accounting policies 
at december  and  the general valuation allowance  including the economic component  totaled million and million  respectively 
starting in late  we witnessed financial difficulties experienced by borrowers in our market  where real estate sale prices have declined and holding periods have increased 
the us economy is still experiencing significantly reduced business activity as a result of  among other factors  disruptions in the financial system  dramatic declines in the housing prices  and an increasing unemployment rate 
there have been significant reductions in spending by consumers and businesses 
in response to this  we have been proactive in evaluating reserve percentages for economic and other qualitative loss factors used to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the increase to the third component of the allowance for loan losses reflected such evaluation

table of contents and  respectively 
the composition and cost of the company s deposit base are important components in analyzing the company s net interest margin and balance sheet liquidity characteristics  both of which are discussed in greater detail in other sections herein 
see net interest income and net interest margin for further discussion 
the company s liquidity is impacted by the volatility of deposits or other funding instruments or  in other words  by the propensity of that money to leave the institution for rate related or other reasons 
deposits can be adversely affected if economic conditions in california and the company s market area in particular  continue to weaken 
potentially  the most volatile deposits in a financial institution are jumbo certificates of deposit  meaning time deposits with balances that equal or exceed  as customers with balances of that magnitude are typically more rate sensitive than customers with smaller balances the following tables summarize the distribution of average daily deposits and the average daily rates paid for the periods indicated distribution of average daily deposits dollars in thousands average deposits dollars in thousands average balance average rate average balance average rate average balance average rate demand  noninterest bearing money market now savings time certificates of deposit of  or more other time deposits total deposits the scheduled maturities of our time deposits in denominations of  or greater at december  are  as follows maturities of time deposits of  or more dollars in thousands three months or less over three months through six months over six months through twelve months over twelve months total because our client base is comprised primarily of commercial and industrial accounts  individual account balances are generally higher than those of consumer oriented banks 
six of our clients carry deposit balances of more than of our total deposits  one of which had a deposit balance of more than of total deposits at december  the company had million and million in brokered deposits as of december  and  respectively 
the only brokered deposits the company holds are from cdars and ics  a certificate of deposit and money market account program  respectively  that exchanges funds with other network banks to offer full fdic insurance coverage to the customer 

table of contents fhlb borrowings although deposits are the primary source of funds for our lending and investment activities and for general business purposes  we may obtain advances from the federal home loan bank of san francisco fhlb as an alternative to retail deposit funds 
our outstanding fhlb advances decreased by million to million at year end compared to the prior year as a result of our emphasis on managing non relationship  high cost cds 
see liquidity management below for the details on the fhlb borrowings program 
the following table is a summary of fhlb borrowings for fiscal years and dollars in thousands balance at year end average balance during the year maximum amount outstanding at any month end average interest rate during the year average interest rate at year end return on equity and assets the following table sets forth certain information regarding our return on equity and assets for the periods indicated at december  at december  return on average assets return on average common equity dividend payout ratio equity to assets ratio deferred compensation obligations we maintain a nonqualified  unfunded deferred compensation plan for certain key management personnel 
under this plan  participating employees may defer compensation  which will entitle them to receive certain payments upon retirement  death  or disability 
the plan provides for payments commencing upon retirement and reduced benefits upon early retirement  disability  or termination of employment 
at december  and  our aggregate payment obligations under this plan totaled million and million  respectively 
off balance sheet arrangements during the ordinary course of business  we provide various forms of credit lines to meet the financing needs of our customers 
these commitments  which represent a credit risk to us  are not represented in any form on our balance sheets 
as of december   and  we had commitments to extend credit of million and million  respectively 
obligations under standby letters of credit were million and million  for  and  respectively  and there were no obligations under commercial letters of credit for either period 
the effect on our revenues  expenses  cash flows and liquidity from the unused portion of the commitments to provide credit cannot be reasonably predicted because there is no guarantee that the lines of credit will be used 
for more information regarding our off balance sheet arrangements  see note commitments and other contingencies to our year end consolidated financial statements located elsewhere in this report 

table of contents contractual obligations the following chart summarizes certain contractual obligations of the company as of december  dollars in thousands contractual obligations less than year years years more than years total fhlb borrowings operating lease obligations supplemental retirement plans time deposit maturities total as permitted or required under california law and to the maximum extent allowable under that law  we have certain obligations to indemnify our current and former officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was serving  at our request in such capacity 
we also have the power to similarly indemnify our current and former officers 
these indemnification obligations are valid as long as the director or officer acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in  or not opposed to  our best interests  and with respect to any criminal action or proceeding  had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification obligations is unlimited  however  we have a director and officer insurance policy that mitigates our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification obligations is minimal 
liquidity and asset liability management management seeks to ascertain optimum and stable utilization of available assets and liabilities as a vehicle to attain our overall business plans and objectives 
in this regard  management focuses on measurement and control of liquidity risk  interest rate risk and market risk  capital adequacy  operation risk and credit risk 
liquidity liquidity to meet borrowers credit and depositors withdrawal demands is provided by maturing assets  short term liquid assets that can be converted to cash and the ability to attract funds from depositors 
additional sources of liquidity may include institutional deposits  advances from the fhlb and other short term borrowings  such as federal funds purchased 
since our deposit growth strategy emphasizes core deposit growth we have avoided relying on brokered deposits as a consistent source of funds 
the only brokered deposit the company holds are from cdars and ics  a certificate of deposit and money market program  respectively  that exchanges funds with other network banks to offer full fdic insurance coverage to the customer 
the company had million and million in brokered deposits as of december  and  respectively 
as a secondary source of liquidity  we rely on advances from the fhlb to supplement our supply of lendable funds and to meet deposit withdrawal requirements 
advances from the fhlb are typically secured by a portion of our loan portfolio and stock issued by the fhlb 
the fhlb determines limitations on the amount of advances by assigning a percentage to each eligible loan category that will count towards the borrowing capacity 
at december  and december   the company had total fhlb advances outstanding of million and million which equaled and of our borrowing capacity  respectively 
at december  and december   the company had sufficient collateral to borrow an additional million and million  respectively 
in addition  the company had lines of credit with its correspondent banks to purchase overnight federal funds totaling million and million at december  and  respectively 
no advances were made on these lines of credit as of december  and december  oak valley bancorp s liquidity depends primarily on dividends paid to it as sole shareholder of the company 
the company s ability to pay dividends to oak valley bancorp without regulatory approval will depend on whether the company will be in a position to pay dividends 
maintenance of adequate liquidity requires that sufficient resources be available at all time to meet our cash flow requirements 
liquidity in a banking institution is required primarily to provide for deposit withdrawals and the credit needs of its 
table of contents customers and to take advantage of investment opportunities as they arise 
liquidity management involves our ability to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without incurring significant loss  and to raise cash or maintain funds without incurring excessive additional cost 
for this purpose  we maintain a portion of our funds in cash and cash equivalents  loans and securities available for sale 
our liquid assets at december  and totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
our liquidity level measured as the percentage of liquid assets to total assets was and at december   and  respectively 
capital resources and capital adequacy requirements in the past two years  our primary source of capital has been internally generated operating income through retained earnings 
at december   total shareholders equity increased to million  representing an increase of million from december  in december  the company was selected to participate in the us treasury capital purchase program which demonstrated the confidence the us treasury department has in the stability of the company 
the company issued million in series a preferred stock 
in august  the company repurchased these series a preferred stock shares and simultaneously issued  in series b preferred stock to the us treasury under the small business lending funding sblf program 
subsequently  the company fully redeemed a warrant to purchase  shares of its common stock  at the exercise price of per share that the company had granted to the us treasury pursuant to the tcpp  for a purchase price of  which settled in september so long as the preferred stock remains outstanding under sblf  it will pay quarterly cumulative dividends at a variable rate between and per year for the first years depending on growth of our small business loan portfolio 
if there is no loan growth after years  the dividend rate could increase to and if the preferred stock remains outstanding after years  the rate increases to  regardless of loan growth 
the company intends to use the capital to increase credit availability to local  creditworthy  businesses and consumers 
the securities issued to the treasury are accounted for as components of regulatory tier capital 
as of december   we had no material commitments for capital expenditures other than the series b preferred stock dividend payments due to the us treasury under the sblf program 
we are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger regulatory actions that could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements and operations 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  we must meet specific capital guidelines that rely on quantitative measures of our assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
our capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings  and other factors 
see description of business regulation and supervision capital adequacy requirements herein for exact definitions and regulatory capital requirements 
as of december   we were qualified as a well capitalized institution under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
the following table presents the regulatory standards for well capitalized institutions  compared to the bank s capital ratios as of the dates specified regulatory well capitalized standards december  december  total capital to risk weighted assets tier i capital to risk weighted assets tier i capital to average assets market risk market risk is the risk of loss of future earnings  fair values  or future cash flows that may result from changes in the price of a financial instrument 
the value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments 
market risk is attributed to all market risk sensitive financial instruments  including securities  loans  deposits and borrowings  as well as the company s role as a financial intermediary in customer related transactions 
the objective of market risk management is to avoid excessive exposure of the company s earnings and equity to loss and to reduce the volatility inherent in certain financial instruments 

table of contents interest rate management market risk arises from changes in interest rates  exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the company s market risk exposure is primarily that of interest rate risk  and it has established policies and procedures to monitor and limit earnings and balance sheet exposure to changes in interest rates 
the company does not engage in the trading of financial instruments  nor does the company have exposure to currency exchange rates 
the principal objective of interest rate risk management often referred to as asset liability management is to manage the financial components of the company in a manner that will optimize the risk reward equation for earnings and capital in relation to changing interest rates 
the company s exposure to market risk is reviewed on a regular basis by the asset liability committee 
interest rate risk is the potential of economic losses due to future interest rate changes 
these economic losses can be reflected as a loss of future net interest income and or a loss of current fair market values 
the objective is to measure the effect on net interest income and to adjust the balance sheet to minimize the inherent risk while at the same time maximizing income 
management realizes certain risks are inherent  and that the goal is to identify and manage the risks 
management uses two methodologies to manage interest rate risk i a standard gap analysis  and ii an interest rate shock simulation model 
the planning of asset and liability maturities is an integral part of the management of an institution s net interest margin 
to the extent maturities of assets and liabilities do not match in a changing interest rate environment  the net interest margin may change over time 
even with perfectly matched repricing of assets and liabilities  risks remain in the form of prepayment of loans or securities or in the form of delays in the adjustment of rates of interest applying to either earning assets with floating rates or to interest bearing liabilities 
the company has generally been able to control its exposure to changing interest rates by maintaining primarily floating interest rate loans and a majority of its time certificates with relatively short maturities 
interest rate changes do not affect all categories of assets and liabilities equally or at the same time 
varying interest rate environments can create unexpected changes in prepayment levels of assets and liabilities  which may have a significant effect on the net interest margin and are not reflected in the interest sensitivity analysis table 
because of these factors  an interest sensitivity gap report may not provide a complete assessment of the exposure to changes in interest rates 
the company uses modeling software for asset liability management in order to simulate the effects of potential interest rate changes on the company s net interest margin  and to calculate the estimated fair values of the company s financial instruments under different interest rate scenarios 
the program imports current balances  interest rates  maturity dates and repricing information for individual financial instruments  and incorporates assumptions on the characteristics of embedded options along with pricing and duration for new volumes to project the effects of a given interest rate change on the company s interest income and interest expense 
rate scenarios consisting of key rate and yield curve projections are run against the company s investment  loan  deposit and borrowed funds portfolios 
these rate projections can be shocked an immediate and parallel change in all base rates  up or down and ramped an incremental increase or decrease in rates over a specified time period  based on current trends and econometric models or stable economic conditions unchanged from current actual levels 
the company applies a market value mv methodology to gauge its interest rate risk exposure as derived from its simulation model 
generally  mv is the discounted present value of the difference between incoming cash flows on interest earning assets and other investments and outgoing cash flows on interest bearing liabilities and other liabilities 
the application of the methodology attempts to quantify interest rate risk as the change in the mv which would result from a theoretical basis point basis point equals change in market interest rates 
both a basis point increase and a basis point decrease in market rates are considered 
at december   it was estimated that the company s mv would decrease in the event of an immediate basis point increase in market interest rates 
the company s mv at the same date would increase in the event of an immediate basis point decrease in applicable interest rates

first  it does not use arbitrary repricing intervals and accounts for all expected future cash flows 
second  because the mv method projects cash flows of each financial instrument under different interest rate environments  it can incorporate the effect of embedded options on an institution s interest rate risk exposure 
third  it allows interest rates on different instruments to change by varying amounts in response to a change in market interest rates  resulting in more accurate estimates of cash flows 
however  as with any method of gauging interest rate risk  there are certain shortcomings inherent to the mv methodology 
the model assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve 
in reality  rate changes are rarely instantaneous 
the use of the simplifying assumption that short term and long term rates change by the same degree may also misstate historic rate patterns  which rarely show parallel yield curve shifts 
further  the model assumes that certain assets and liabilities of similar maturity or period to repricing will react in the same way to changes in rates 
in reality  certain types of financial instruments may react in advance of changes in market rates  while the reaction of other types of financial instruments may lag behind the change in general market rates 
when interest rates change  actual loan prepayments and actual early withdrawals from certificates may deviate significantly from the assumptions used in the model 
finally  this methodology does not measure or reflect the impact that higher rates may have on adjustable rate loan clients ability to service their debt 
all of these factors are considered in monitoring the company s exposure to interest rate risk 
impact of inflation  seasonality inflation primarily impacts us by its effect on interest rates 
our primary source of income is net interest income  which is affected by changes in interest rates 
we attempt to limit the impact of inflation on our net interest margin through management of rate sensitive assets and liabilities and the analysis of interest rate sensitivity 
the effect of inflation on premises and equipment as well as noninterest expenses has not been significant for the periods covered in this report 
our business is generally not seasonal
