changes in financial condition cash and cash equivalents were  at december   rising  compared to the cash balance of  at december  the increase was mostly a factor of strong sales during the year  which produced  of net income and the residual cash 
a reduction in cash was however felt in connection with insurance premium payments of  for long term coverage 
there was also an increase in accounts receivable of  from last year as noted below  which reflects amounts that are still to be collected and therefore not yet recognized in cash 
accounts receivable at december  was  and was  at december   which represents an increase of  the majority of this increase is consistent with sales growth in the latter half of the final quarter compared to the prior year 
the company is not aware of any significant collectability issues  and notes that accounts receivable aging over days have diminished between those periods 
other current assets and other long term assets have increased by  and  respectively 
regarding current assets  the company has prepaid tax payments of  at december   versus a  liability that existed at december   which accounts for a majority of that change 
for other long term assets  as noted above in the cash discussion  the company has pre paid for long term insurance coverage  which is a new strategy to reduce the overall expense to the company 
accrued commissions and sales incentives decreased  starting at  at december   and decreasing to  at december  in general  the promotional incentive program obligations in have decreased in comparison to the prior year 
the products with the most significant incentive programs have not recognized sales increases to the magnitude of those demonstrated by the company in total  and therefore  customers are not hitting sales growth tiers equal to the level experienced in other liabilities were  at december   compared to  at december  the  increase is primarily associated with increases in general legal and product liability costs 
the company is vigorously defending numerous claims of which it is a defendant  and is also the plaintiff in a case to recover insurance damages 
these cases are more fully disclosed in the commitments and contingencies note  as well as in part ii  item i  under the caption legal proceedings 
results of operations three months ended december  vs 
december  the company reported comparative results from continuing operations for the three month period ended december  and as follows three months ended december  in thousands net sales gross profit operating profit the company s sales increased  from  in the three month period ended december  to  in the three month period december  the company recently transitioned all of its standard csst sales in the united states to tracpipe counterstrike  an enhanced flexible gas piping product that provides an extra measure of safety against the unlikely event of lightning 
sales of tracpipe related products  especially tracpipe counterstrike  have grown steadily over last year 
additionally  the company has experienced an expansion of sales associated with its highly engineered assembled product capabilities  and more recent offerings such as doubletrac 
the company has also seen improvements in revenue overseas mostly in the united kingdom 
altogether  revenues for the fourth quarter exemplify a growing appreciation for the benefits and unique features of the company s products 
overall  unit volume for the quarter was up approximately compared to the prior year quarter 
sales were further enhanced by increases to the selling prices of numerous products  which were required to combat the rising price of the company s core raw materials 
a reduction in marketing incentives during the quarter also helped to sustain a higher level of net sales 
the company s gross profits have increased  from last year 
gross profits also held close as a percent of sales  being for the three month period ended december   and for the same period in there was a rise in cost for numerous commodity type metals  such as nickel  which adversely impacts the price of stainless steel  a key raw material used in the manufacturing of many of the company s flexible metal hoses  and copper  a key component of brass  which is used in the company s patented fittings 
however  these additional costs were largely offset by selling price increases initiated by the company  and various manufacturing efficiencies 
selling expenses 
selling expenses consist primarily of employee salaries and associated overhead costs  commissions  and the cost of marketing programs such as advertising  trade shows and related communication costs  and freight 
selling expense was  and  for the three months ended december  and  respectively  increasing  the most significant increase was noted in advertising  which went up  largely focused on proprietary products such as tracpipe counterstike 
there was also an increase during the quarter in commissions and freight largely the result of higher sales 
sales expense as a percentage of sales increased from to for the three months ended december  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee salaries  benefits for administrative  executive and finance personnel  legal and accounting  and corporate general services 
general and administrative expenses were  and  for the three months ended december  and  respectively 
the  increase between quarters was primarily associated with two items 
during the first three quarters of  incentive compensation was being accrued at a higher rate than typical  and was then decreased in the fourth quarter of to bring it into alignment with historical payouts 
incentive compensation relative to the fourth quarter of was accrued at a more normal rate  and therefore did not require any realignment 
the change between years relative to incentive compensation in the fourth quarter was  additionally  the combination of legal and product liability costs also increased  as a percentage of sales  general and administrative expenses increased from for the three months ended december  to for the three months ended december  engineering expense 
engineering expenses consist of development expenses associated with the development of new products and enhancements to existing products  and manufacturing process improvements 
engineering expenses were almost identical to the prior year  being  and  for the three months ended december  and  respectively 
as a percent of sales  engineering expenses were and for the last three months of and  respectively 
operating profits 
reflecting all of the factors mentioned above  operating profits decreased   from a profit of  in the three month period ended december   to a profit of  in the three month period ended december  interest expense income net 
interest income was nominal for the fourth quarter of and  and there was also very little change between the two periods 
other expense income net 
this component primarily consists of foreign currency exchange gains losses on transactions 
income tax expense 
the company s effective tax rate in is lower than the rate due to the expiration of the statute of limitations for assessment related to the company s filings in earlier years  which lowered the tax expense by  for the three months ended december twelve months ended december  vs 
december  the company reported comparative results from continuing operations for the twelve month period ended december  and as follows twelve months ended december  in thousands net sales gross profit operating profit the company s sales increased  from  in the twelve month period ended december  to  in the twelve month period december  revenue for the twelve months ended december  reflects the market s support of the company s proprietary products and conviction to innovation and safety  as indicated by the strong sales of tracpipe counterstrike over the prior year 
tracpipe counterstrike is the only csst product on the market that has been listed by independent evaluation agencies for resistance to damage from lightning  seismic events earthquakes  and flame smoke spread 
additionally  the company has noticed improvements in its international revenues mostly associated with its united kingdom subsidiary  and from its highly engineered assembled products 
positive strides were further recognized by some of the company s fledgling products  such as doubletrac  which gained momentum due to its superior performance and ease of use 
for the company as a whole  unit sales volume for the current year increased approximately compared to the prior year 
there were also increases to the selling prices of numerous products  which were required to overcome the rising price of the company s core raw materials 
a reduction in marketing incentives during the year also helped to increase net sales 
the company s gross profits increased  over the prior year 
as a percent of sales  gross profits were and for the twelve month periods ended december  and  respectively 
the slight deterioration in profits as a percent of sales is mostly due to cost increases in numerous commodity type metals including nickel and copper  which adversely impact the price of the company s component material costs  such as stainless steel and brass fittings 
selling price increases were implemented as previously noted to help offset those additional materials costs  but were not sufficient enough to offset them in their entirety  due to the competiveness of the market place 
selling expenses 
selling expenses consist primarily of employee salaries and associated overhead costs  commissions  and the cost of marketing programs such as advertising  trade shows and related communication costs  and freight 
selling expenses were  and  for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively  increasing  the company increased its advertising spending by  with a focus on the many benefits of the company s various proprietary products  such as tracpipe counterstrike 
approximately  of the increase was attributable to staffing expenses  designed to expand sales markets and marketing expertise 
to a lesser extent  expenses related to trade shows  travel  and consulting have also grown 
selling expenses as a percentage of sales increased from to between and general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee salaries  benefits for administrative  executive and finance personnel  legal and accounting  and corporate services 
general and administrative expenses were  and  for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively  representing an increase of  the majority of the change was attributed to legal and product liability costs  which jointly experienced an increase of  with the details described in note of the financial statements 
general and administrative expense costs  as a percentage of sales  have increased from to 
engineering expense 
engineering expenses consist of development expenses associated with the development of new products and enhancements to existing products  and manufacturing process improvements 
engineering expenses were  and  for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
the increase of  was largely related to an increase in developmental costs 
engineering expenses were and as a percent of sales for their respective years 
operating profits 
reflecting all of the factors mentioned above  operating profits were largely in line with the prior year  being  in the twelve month period ended december   and  in the twelve month period ended december  operating profit as a percent of sales lost two points  at and in and  respectively 
interest expense income net 
interest income includes interest earned at on the note receivable from mestek  the company s former parent  which was issued in june  and paid back in october of interest expense was recorded at on the sovereign line of credit loan balance outstanding  which was established in december  and paid in full by the end of november the net increase in income from last year was  other expense income net 
other income net primarily consists of foreign currency exchange gains losses on transactions 
there was an increase to income from last year of  income tax expense 
the company s effective tax rate in is essentially the same as in the rate in does not differ materially from expected statutory rates 
commitments and contingencies commitments under a number of indemnity agreements between the company and each of its officers and directors  the company has agreed to indemnify each of its officers and directors against any liability asserted against them in their capacity as an officer or director  or both 
the company s indemnity obligations under the indemnity agreements are subject to certain conditions and limitations set forth in each of the agreements 
under the terms of the agreement  the company is contingently liable for costs which may be incurred by the officers and directors in connection with claims arising by reason of these individuals roles as officers and directors 
the company has obtained directors and officers insurance policies to fund certain of the company s obligations under the indemnity agreements 
the company has salary continuation agreements with one current employee  and one former employee who retired at the end of these agreements provide for monthly payments to each of the employees or their designated beneficiary upon the employee s retirement or death 
the payment benefits range from  per month to  per month with the term of such payments limited to years after the employee s retirement at age the agreements also provide for survivorship benefits if the employee dies before attaining age  and severance payments if the employee is terminated without cause  the amount of which is dependent on the length of company service at the date of termination 
the net present value of the retirement payments associated with these agreements is  at december   of which  is included in other long term liabilities  and the remaining current portion of  is included in other liabilities  associated with the retired employee previously noted who is now receiving benefit payments 
the december  liability of  had  reported in other long term liabilities  and a current portion of  in other liabilities 
the company has obtained and is the beneficiary of three whole life insurance policies with respect to the two employees discussed above  and one other policy 
the cash surrender value of such policies included in other long term assets amounts to  at december  and  at december  contingencies the company s general liability insurance policies are subject to deductibles or retentions  ranging from  to  per claim  depending on the terms of the policy and the applicable policy year up to an aggregate amount 
the company is insured on a first dollar basis for workers compensation subject to statutory limits 
in the ordinary and normal conduct of our business  the company is subject to periodic lawsuits  investigations and claims collectively  the claims 
there has been an increase in the frequency of those claims over the past two years relating to product liability 
the company does not believe that the claims have legal merit  and is therefore vigorously defending against those claims 
the company has in place commercial general liability insurance policies that cover the claims  as noted above  including those alleging damages as a result of product defects 
litigation is subject to many uncertainties and management is unable to predict the outcome of the pending suits and claims 
it is possible that the results of operations or liquidity and capital resources of the company could be adversely affected by the ultimate outcome of the pending litigation or as a result of the costs of contesting such lawsuits  potentially materially 
the company is currently unable to estimate the ultimate liability  if any  that may result from the pending litigation and  accordingly  no provision for any liability except for accrued legal costs for services and claim settlements previously rendered has been made in the consolidated financial statements 
those liabilities were estimated to be  and  at december  and december   respectively  and are included in other liabilities 
warranty commitments gas transmission products such as those made by the company carry potentially serious personal injury risks in the event of failures in the field 
as a result  the company performs extensive internal testing and other quality control procedures 
historically  due to the extensive nature of these quality controls the company has not had a meaningful warranty claim rate  and the warranty expense is de minimis 
accordingly  the company does not maintain a warranty reserve beyond a nominal amount 
future impact of known trends or uncertainties the company s operations are sensitive to a number of market and extrinsic factors  any one of which could materially adversely affect its results of operations in any given year construction activity the company is directly impacted by the level of single family and multi family residential housing starts and  to a lesser extent  commercial construction starts 
historically low interest rates and easy availability of credit  contributed to construction activity in recent years 
there are a number of factors in the current economy that are reducing the demand for residential  commercial and institutional construction 
these factors include the fairly recent crisis in the financial markets has reduced the availability of financing for new construction  foreclosures have increased the inventory of available residential housing  thereby decreasing the demand for new construction  and consumer demand has declined as a result of reduced economic activity and increased unemployment 
recent initiatives by the federal government to assist individuals with their mortgages  may provide a lift to the housing industry  however  it is possible that once these programs are exhausted that a drop off in housing sector may occur 
additionally  recent news has portrayed a flawed foreclosure system  which may indicate that more foreclosures exist than previously predicted 
this could potentially hinder the speed of new home construction 
a significant reduction in residential construction activity may materially adversely affect the company s revenues 
technological changes although the hvac industry has historically been impacted by technology changes in a relatively incremental manner  it cannot be discounted that radical changes such as might be suggested by fuel cell technology  burner technology and or other developing technologies which might impact the use of natural gas could materially adversely affect the company s results of operations and or financial position in the future 
weather conditions the company s flagship tracpipe and counterstrike products are used in residential and commercial heating applications 
as such  the demand for its products is impacted by weather as it affects the level of construction 
furthermore  severe climatic changes  such as those suggested by the global climate change phenomenon  could over time adversely affect the demand for fossil fuel heating products and adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial position 
purchasing practices it has been the company s policy in recent years to aggregate purchase volumes for high value commodities with fewer vendors to achieve maximum cost reductions while maintaining quality and service 
this policy has been effective in reducing costs  but has introduced additional risk which could potentially result in short term supply disruptions or cost increases from time to time in the future 
legal costs the company is subject to lawsuits relating to claims of product liability 
the company has in place insurance policies to cover the defense of these cases  and any amounts payable with respect thereto  subject to deductibles or self insured retention amounts that vary depending on the policy year 
the company is vigorously defending these cases and is confident of prevailing in one or more lawsuits in the near term 
however  continued litigation and the defense costs associated therewith  in addition to any other payments made  could affect the company s results of operations  perhaps materially 
supply disruptions and commodity risks the company uses a variety of materials in the manufacture of its products  including stainless steel  polyethylene and brass for its autoflare connectors 
in connection with the purchase of commodities  principally stainless steel for manufacturing requirements  the company occasionally enters into one year purchase commitments which include a designated fixed price or range of prices 
these agreements typically require the company to accept delivery of the commodity in the quantities committed  at the agreed upon prices 
transactions required for these commodities in excess of the one year commitments are conducted at current market prices at the company s discretion 
currently  the company does not have any fixed purchase commitment contracts  but may enter into such transactions in the future 
in addition to the raw material cost strategy described above  the company enters into fixed pricing agreements for the fabrication charges necessary to convert these commodities into useable product 
it is possible that prices may decrease below the fixed prices agreed upon and therefore require the company to pay more than market price  potentially materially 
management believes at present that it has adequate sources of supply for its raw materials and components subject to the risks described above under purchasing practices and has historically not had significant difficulty in obtaining the raw materials  component parts or finished goods from its suppliers 
the company is not dependent for any commodity on a single supplier  the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on its business 
interest rate sensitivity the company currently has access to a  line of credit loc with sovereign bank  na sovereign  but has no draws on the line outstanding at december   and therefore has no related interest rate risk 
however  if the company borrows against the loc  all amounts must be paid back with interest  using an interest rate range of libor plus to libor plus or prime less to prime plus  depending upon the company s then existing financial ratios 
the company may elect to use either the libor or prime rates 
as of december   the actual rate to borrow was at 
interest rates are also significant to the company as a participant in the residential construction industry  since interest rates can be a determinant factor on whether or not borrowing funds for building will be affordable to our customers 
see construction activity  above 
currently  interest rates are at historic lows  but any dramatic change to interest rates could have a detrimental effect on the business 
retention of qualified personnel the company does not operate with multiple levels of management 
it is relatively flat organizationally  which does subject the company to the risks associated with the loss of critical managers 
from time to time  there may be a shortage of skilled labor  which may make it more difficult and expensive for the company to attract and retain qualified employees 
the company is dependent upon the relatively unique talents and managerial skills of a small number of key executives 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates financial reporting release no 
 released by the securities and exchange commission  requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the following is a brief discussion of the company s more significant accounting policies 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to revenue recognition  inventory valuations  goodwill and intangible asset valuations  product liability costs  phantom stock and accounting for income taxes 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates 
our critical accounting policies and significant estimates and assumptions are described in more detail as follows revenue recognition the company s revenue recognition activities relate almost entirely to the manufacture and sale of flexible metal hose and pipe 
under gaap  revenues are considered to have been earned when the company has substantially accomplished what it must do to be entitled to the benefits represented by the revenues 
the following criteria represent preconditions to the recognition of revenue persuasive evidence of an arrangement for the sale of product or services must exist 
delivery has occurred or services rendered 
the sales price to the customer is fixed or determinable 
collection is reasonably assured 
the company generally recognizes revenue upon shipment in accordance with the above principles 
gross sales are reduced for all consideration paid to customers for which no identifiable benefit is received by the company 
this includes promotional incentives  which includes various programs including year end rebates and discounts 
the amounts of certain incentives are known with reasonable certainty at the time of sale  while others are projected based upon the most reliable information available at the reporting date 
commissions  for which the company receives an identifiable benefit  are accounted for as a selling expense 
accounts receivable accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
the estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts is based primarily on specific analysis of accounts in the receivable portfolio and historical write off experience 
while management believes the allowance to be adequate  if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost of inventories are determined by the first in  first out fifo method 
the company generally considers inventory quantities beyond two years usage  measured on a historical usage basis  to be excess inventory and reduces the gross carrying value of inventory accordingly 
goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb asc topic  with respect to goodwill and intangibles  the company performs annual impairment tests using the market capitalization on the last day of the year to determine the fair value of the reporting unit and then compares that value to the carrying value 
as of december  and december   the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying value  and therefore the company concluded that goodwill was not impaired 
product liability reserves product liability reserves represent the unpaid amounts under the company s insurance policies with respect to claims that have been resolved 
the company uses the most current available data to estimate claims 
as explained more fully under contingencies  for various product liability claims covered under the company s general liability insurance policies  the company must pay certain defense costs within its deductible or self insured retention limits  ranging from  to  per claim  depending on the terms of the policy in the applicable policy year  up to an aggregate amount 
the company is vigorously defending against all known claims 
phantom stock the company uses the black scholes option pricing model as its method for determining fair value of the units 
the company uses the straight line method of attributing the value of the stock based compensation expense relating to the units 
the compensation expense including adjustment of the liability to its fair value from the units is recognized over the requisite service period of each grant or award 
the fasb asc topic stock compensation requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates in order to derive the company s best estimate of awards ultimately to vest 
forfeitures represent only the unvested portion of a surrendered unit and are typically estimated based on historical experience 
based on an analysis of the company s historical data  which has limited experience related to any stock based plan forfeitures  the company applied a forfeiture rate to plan units outstanding in determining its plan unit compensation expense for december  accounting for income taxes the company accounts for federal tax liabilities in accordance with asc topic  income taxes 
under this method the company recorded tax expense  related deferred taxes and tax benefits  and uncertainties in tax positions 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that these items will either expire before the company is able to realize the benefit  or that future deductibility is uncertain 
no valuation allowance was deemed necessary at december  or at december  also  in accordance with fasb asc topic  the company reserved for uncertainties in tax positions of  at december   and  at december  these reserves are reviewed each quarter 
liquidity and capital resources twelve months ended december  the company s cash balance at december  was  compared to  at december   which represents an increase of  between the periods 
the change is attributable to various components  as described below 
operating activities cash provided by operating activities was  lower in than in  being  and  respectively 
cash related to accounts receivable is unfavorable by  compared to last year 
sales for the final two months of were substantially stronger than in the same period of the collection of a majority of that cash however had yet to be realized 
the overall disparity in cash is considered to be timing related and is expected to flow through in the coming months 
there has been no discernible deterioration to the company s customer base or customer liquidity  as it is tracked on a regular basis 
also  accounts over days old have diminished from of the accounts receivable balance at december   to only at the end of inventory purchases have increased  from last year 
the company has expanded its warehousing through the use of its sales agencies in various strategic locations to allow for the expansion of business and superior delivery time 
the company has also decided to stock certain additional merchandise where demand is growing and a quick turnaround is required to fulfill sales 
cash has also been used at a higher level in other assets 
a change of  compared to last year is primarily related to prepaying for a year product liability insurance coverage during in the past the company typically only had premiums related to a twelve or thirteen month period 
accrued commissions and sales incentives required  more cash 
sales incentive payouts were higher in because the increase in sales was more significant between and then it was between and therefore  more customers were able to reach higher growth tier rebates in  which were then paid out during of investing activities cash used in investing activities in was  compared with  provided in during the fourth quarter of  the company received payment of the  outstanding note from mestek  described in note  offset partially by  of capital spending 
all of the outflows in related to capital spending 
financing there was only cash used in financing activities relative to in the amount of  which was the result of available cash being applied to the outstanding line of credit 
recent accounting pronouncements asu  fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements this asu affects all entities that are required to make disclosures about recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements under fasb asc topic  originally issued as fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements 
the asu requires certain new disclosures and clarifies two existing disclosure requirements 
the new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level fair value measurements 
those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
the company does not believe that these new fair value measurement requirements will have a significant impact on the company s financial position  results or operation  or cash flows 
off balance sheet obligations or arrangements the company has off balance sheet obligations or arrangements at december  that relate to purchase commitments for the following year  and also operating lease obligations  which total equal  the total amount of these obligations at december  was  item a quantitatative and qualitative market risks the company does not engage in the purchase or trading of market risk sensitive instruments 
the company does not presently have any positions with respect to hedge transactions such as forward contracts relating to currency fluctuations 
no market risk sensitive instruments are held for speculative or trading purposes
