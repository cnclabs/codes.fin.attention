item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our audited consolidated financial statements for the three years ended december   including the notes thereto  appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements 
see forward looking statements for a discussion of uncertainties  risks and assumptions associated with these statements 
overview our business segments are based on the organizational structure used by management for making operating and investment decisions and for assessing performance 
our reportable business segments are i broadcasting  ii publishing  and iii corporate 
our broadcasting segment  operating in states  consists of radio stations and television stations and the operation of a television station under a local marketing agreement 
our publishing segment consists of the milwaukee journal sentinel  which serves as the only major daily newspaper for the milwaukee metropolitan area  and several community newspapers and shoppers in wisconsin 
results from our digital media assets are included in our publishing and broadcasting segments 
our corporate segment consists of unallocated corporate expenses and revenue eliminations 
revenues in the broadcast industry are derived primarily from the sale of advertising time to local  national and political and issue advertisers  retransmission fees and  to a lesser extent  from barter  digital revenues  network compensation and other revenues 
our television and radio stations are attracting new local advertisers through the creation of new  and enhancing the presentation of existing  local content and programs that combine television or radio with digital 
because as a television and radio broadcaster we rely upon advertising revenue  we are subject to cyclical changes in the economy 
the size of advertisers budgets  which are affected by broad economic trends  affects the radio industry in general and the revenue of individual television stations  in particular 
our broadcasting business continues to experience an uneven economic recovery across the markets in which we operate due to continued challenges in employment and the housing markets 
our broadcasting business also is affected by audience fragmentation as audiences have an increasing number of options to access news and other programming 
television advertising revenue and rates in even numbered years typically benefit from political and issue advertising because there tends to be more pressure on available inventory as the demand for advertising increases and we have the opportunity to increase average unit rates we charge our customers 

index revenue from our broadcasting businesses decreased million in compared to primarily due to an million decrease in political and issue advertising revenue and a million decrease in olympic advertising revenue  partially offset by a million increase in local advertising revenue and a million increase in retransmission revenue 
operating earnings from our broadcasting business decreased million in compared to  primarily due to the impact from the decrease in advertising revenue  an increase in expenses and a million non cash broadcast license impairment charge 
total broadcasting expenses increased million  or  in compared to primarily due to increases in employee related costs and promotional expenses 
over the past several years  fundamentals in the newspaper industry have deteriorated significantly 
retail and classified run of press rop advertising has decreased from historic levels due in part to department store consolidation  weakened employment  automotive and real estate economics and a migration of advertising to the internet and other advertising forms 
circulation declines and digital competition have also negatively impacted newspaper industry revenues 
additionally  the continued housing market downturn has adversely impacted the newspaper industry  including real estate classified advertising as well as the home improvement  furniture and financial services advertising categories 
in  we sold our florida based community newspapers and shoppers businesses 
net proceeds were million and we recorded pre tax gains on the sales  net of transaction expenses  of million 
the divestitures allow us to focus our efforts on operating our wisconsin based community newspapers and shoppers businesses 
revenue and operating earnings in for the florida based community newspapers and shoppers businesses were million and million  respectively 
revenue and operating earnings in for the florida based community newspapers and shoppers businesses were million and million  respectively 
in  our publishing businesses continued to be impacted by the uneven economic recovery and the secular and cyclical influences affecting the newspaper industry 
revenue from our publishing businesses decreased million in compared to we have seen advertisers reduce their advertising spending in virtually all advertising categories 
retail advertising revenue decreased million in compared to primarily due to a decrease in rop and preprint advertising primarily in the communications  home improvement  furniture  automotive and finance categories 
classified advertising revenue decreased million primarily in the real estate  other and automotive categories in compared to interactive advertising revenue increased million at our daily newspaper in compared to primarily due to an increase in retail sponsorships 
national advertising revenue decreased million in primarily due to a decrease in rop advertising in the communications  health services  finance and dining and entertainment categories 
at our daily newspaper  commercial delivery revenue increased million in compared to operating earnings at our publishing businesses decreased million in compared to  including million and million workforce reduction charges in and  respectively  to align our expenses in our publishing business with lower revenue 
the decrease in operating earnings was primarily due to the impact of the decrease in advertising revenue 
total expenses decreased million  or  in compared to primarily due to a decrease in employee related costs  a charge in for the withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan  the pre tax gain on the sales of the florida based community newspapers and shoppers businesses and a decrease in newsprint and paper costs 
advertising revenue at our publishing and broadcasting businesses reflects continued cautious behavior of both our advertisers and consumers 
while we are seeing some improvement at our broadcasting businesses  persistent high unemployment  lack of strong economic growth and continued economic uncertainty temper our optimism with respect to improved revenue in the near term 
although our broadcasting business will be affected by increased competition for audiences  we are working to deliver relevant  differentiated local content  allowing us to provide value to local advertisers and maintain a focus on growing our local market revenue share 
we expect revenues at our broadcasting business to increase in compared to due to political elections  higher retransmission revenue and the broadcast of the summer olympics on our three nbc affiliates 
we do not expect that revenues at our daily newspaper will return to revenue levels reported in or prior years given the secular changes affecting the newspaper industry 
we continue to seek in market growth opportunities in traditional or digital media  make capital investments in our businesses and consider value creating broadcast acquisition opportunities 
our acquisition strategy will continue to be subject to our ability to identify strategic acquisition candidates  negotiate definitive agreements on acceptable terms and  as necessary  secure additional financing 
annual broadcast license impairment tests our annual impairment test on broadcast licenses was performed at individual television and radio stations as of september  the impairment tests indicated three of our television broadcast licenses were impaired due to a decline in projected long term market revenues and an increase in the discount rates 
the changes in the discount rate used for our broadcast licenses are primarily driven by changes in the expected return on the public equity of comparable companies in the television and media sector and the average cost of capital 
in accordance with the financial accounting standards board s fasb guidance for goodwill and intangible assets  our broadcast licenses were written down to their estimated fair value of million  resulting in a million non cash impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 
index for broadcast licenses at individual television and radio stations  we used an income approach to estimate fair value 
this approach uses the greenfield method  which assumes the start up of a new station by an independent market participant  and incorporates assumptions that are based on past experience and judgments about future market performance 
these variables include  but are not limited to the forecasted growth rate of each market including market population  household income and retail sales  estimated market share  profit margins and operating cash flows of an independent station within a market  estimated capital expenditures and start up costs  risk adjusted discount rate  likely media competition within the market and expected growth rates into perpetuity to estimate terminal values 
adverse changes in significant assumptions such as an increase in discount rates  or a decrease in projected market revenues  market share or operating cash flows could result in additional non cash impairment charges on our broadcast licenses in future periods  which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we based the valuation of broadcast licenses our internal projections and industry based assumptions september  september  september  may  television discount rate tax rate long term growth rate radio discount rate tax rate long term growth rate as of december   if we were to increase the discount rates by and by  it would result in impairment charges of million and million  respectively 
if we were to decrease the long term growth rates to and to  it would result in impairment charges of million and million  respectively 
interim and annual goodwill impairment tests during the third quarter of  we sold the remaining florida based businesses of our community newspapers and shoppers reporting unit 
in conjunction with the sale  an interim impairment test as of september  was performed on the carrying value of million of goodwill associated with this reporting unit 
our interim impairment test indicated there was no goodwill impairment 
the percentage by which estimated fair value exceeded carrying value was greater than 
we will continue to monitor events and economic conditions in the markets in which our community newspapers and shoppers operate 
we cannot predict at this time when  or if  we will have another triggering event in the future which would cause us to test for impairment of our goodwill 
our annual impairment tests on goodwill associated with our community newspaper and shoppers reporting unit and our broadcasting reporting unit as of september  indicated there was no impairment of our goodwill 
for purposes of testing the carrying value of goodwill related to our community newspaper and shoppers reporting unit  we determine fair value using an income and a market valuation approach 
the income approach uses expected cash flows of the reporting unit 
the cash flows are discounted for risk and time value 
in addition  the present value of the projected residual value is estimated and added to the present value of the cash flows 
the market approach is based on price multiples of publicly traded stocks of comparable companies to derive fair value 
each approach estimated a fair value exceeding carrying value 
each approach is weighted equally to determine a fair value estimate of the reporting unit 
we base our fair value estimates on various assumptions about our projected operating results  including continuing declines in publishing revenues as well as an expectation that we will achieve cash flow benefits from our continuing cost cutting measures 
the valuation methodology used to estimate the fair value of our reporting unit requires inputs and assumptions ie  market growth  operating cash flow margins and discount rates that reflect current market conditions as well as management judgment 
these assumptions may change due to changes in market conditions and such changes may result in an impairment of our goodwill 
we based the valuation of goodwill related to our community newspapers and shoppers reporting unit on our internal projections and industry based assumptions september september september discount rate operating cash flow margins tax rate long term growth rate as of december   if we were to increase the discount rates by or decrease the long term growth rates by  step two of the goodwill impairment test would not be triggered 
decreasing the operating cash flow margins by would trigger step two of the goodwill impairment test on our million goodwill balance at our community newspapers and shoppers reporting unit 
for purposes of testing the carrying values of goodwill related to our broadcasting reporting unit  we determine fair value by using an income and a market valuation approach 
the income approach uses expected cash flows of the reporting unit 
the cash flows are discounted for risk and time value 
in addition  the present value of the projected residual value is estimated and added to the present value of the cash flows 
the market approach is based on price multiples of publicly traded stocks of comparable companies to derive fair value 
each approach is weighted equally to determine a fair value estimate of the reporting unit 
we base our fair value estimates  in large measure  on projected financial information which we believe to be reasonable 
however  actual future results may differ from those projections  and those differences may be material 
the valuation methodology used to estimate the fair value of our reporting unit requires inputs and assumptions ie  market growth  operating cash flows margins and discount rates that reflect current market conditions as well as management judgment 
we based the valuation of goodwill related to our broadcasting reporting unit on our internal projections and industry based assumptions september september september television discount rate tax rate long term growth rate radio discount rate tax rate long term growth rate as of december   increasing the discount rates by or decreasing the long term growth rates by would not trigger step two of the goodwill impairment test on our million goodwill balance at our broadcasting reporting unit

the retail advertising revenue decreases were in the communications  home improvement  furniture  automotive and finance categories 
classified advertising revenue decreased in compared to primarily due to decreases in the real estate  other and automotive categories 
partially offsetting these revenue decreases was a increase in commercial delivery revenue and a increase in online advertising revenue at our daily newspaper in compared to the decrease in total operating costs and expenses in compared to was primarily due to a decrease in employee related costs reflecting the savings from workforce reduction initiatives implemented in  the decrease in revenue and a decrease in syndicated programming expenses 
the decrease was partially offset by an increase in delivery fees for our re launched  mail based total market coverage product and increases in sports broadcast rights fees and network programming fees 
the decrease in selling and administrative expenses was primarily due to a property impairment charge in  a decrease in executive incentive compensation due to the decrease in operating earnings and a decrease in third party commission expenses

ebitda in was million  a decrease of million  or  compared to million in we define ebitda as net earnings loss excluding earnings loss from discontinued operations  net  provision benefit for income taxes  total other expense  net which is entirely comprised of interest income and expense  depreciation and amortization 
management primarily uses ebitda  among other things  to evaluate our operating performance compared to our operating plans and or prior years and to value prospective acquisitions 
we believe the presentation of this measure is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by management  helps to improve their ability to understand our operating performance and makes it easier to compare our results with other companies that have different financing and capital structures or tax rates 
ebitda is also a primary measure used externally by our investors and our peers in our industry for purposes of valuation and comparing our operating performance to other companies in the industry 
ebitda is not a measure of performance or liquidity calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
ebitda should not be considered in isolation of  or as a substitute for  net earnings as an indicator of operating performance or cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity 
ebitda  as we calculate it  may not be comparable to ebitda measures reported by other companies 
the following table presents a reconciliation of our consolidated net earnings to ebitda for and dollars in millions net earnings gain from discontinued operations  net provision for income taxes total other expense  net which is entirely comprised of interest income and expense depreciation amortization ebitda the decrease in our ebitda was consistent with the decrease in our operating earnings for the reasons described above

local advertising revenue increased due to an increase in local inventory availability due to this being a non political broadcast year and an increase in digital advertising revenue 
political and issue advertising revenue decreased in as is considered a non political and issue advertising year  which also contributed to an increase in local inventory availability 
television advertising revenue and rates in even numbered years typically benefit from political and issue advertising because there tends to be more pressure on available inventory as the demand for advertising increases and we have the opportunity to increase the average unit rates we charge our customers

the revenue decreases were in the communications  home improvement  furniture  automotive and finance categories 
we believe consumers are still cautious in regards to spending discretionary income and advertisers are still decreasing their spending in traditional print products  including our daily newspaper 
the same trends persisted in our community newspapers and shoppers business 
the million decrease in retail advertising revenue at our community newspapers and shoppers business was primarily due to revenue decreases as a result of the sale of the florida based publications in and a decrease from publications we decided to exit  and decreases in automotive  retail and real estate advertising 
classified advertising is generally the most sensitive to economic cycles because it is driven by the demand of employment  real estate transactions and automotive sales

additionally  the other category decreased million  or  the automotive category decreased million  or  and the employment category decreased million  or  compared to the average rate per inch of classified advertising decreased in compared to primarily due to the planned decrease in rates for employment classified revenue in an effort to increase volume 
we believe this strategy was successful as we experienced a increase in volume for employment classified advertising in compared to historically  rates for employment classified advertising have been higher than other classified advertising categories 
average rates per inch for real estate and automotive advertising revenue also decreased compared to  partially due to our planned decrease in rates for real estate classified advertising revenue

our secured credit facility with extending lenders expires on december  the commitments of the non extending lenders expired on june  since august   there has been no principal outstanding under the commitments which matured on june  based on actuarial estimates  we expect to make contributions of million to the qualified pension plan over a ten year period

off balance sheet arrangements we do not engage in off balance sheet transactions  arrangements  obligations including contingent obligations  and other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that may have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  capital resources  or significant components of revenues or expenses 
we do not rely on off balance sheet arrangements for liquidity  capital resources  market risk support  credit risk support or other benefits 
critical accounting policies our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related footnote disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to doubtful accounts  property and equipment  intangible assets  income taxes  litigation  and pension and other postretirement benefits 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we do not believe our past results have differed materially from these estimates  however  we cannot predict how actual results may differ from these estimates in the future 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
we specifically review historical write off activity by market  large customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness and changes in our customer payment patterns and terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us such as bankruptcy filings  credit history  etc  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due us to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts based on past loss history  the length of time the receivables are past due and the current business environment 
if our evaluations of the collectability of our accounts receivable differ from actual results  increases or decreases in bad debt expense and allowances may be required 
property and equipment and definite lived intangibles we assign useful lives for our property and equipment and definite lived intangibles based on our estimate of the amount of time that we will use those assets and we have selected the straight line method to depreciate our property and equipment and definite lived intangibles 
a change in the estimated useful lives or the depreciation or amortization method used could have a material impact upon our results of operations 
accounting standards require that  if the sum of the future cash flows expected to result from an asset or group of assets  undiscounted and without interest charges  is less than the carrying amount of the asset or group of assets  an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
an evaluation of impairment of our property and equipment and definite lived intangibles was performed in a decision was made to consolidate the radio and television operations in omaha  nebraska and sell one of the buildings 
accordingly  we recorded a charge of million for the impairment of property at our broadcasting business 
an evaluation of our property and equipment and definite lived intangible assets did not indicate an impairment in the estimated future cash flows related to an asset or group of assets is highly susceptible to change because we must make assumptions about future revenue and the related cost of sales 
changes in our assumptions could require us to recognize a loss for asset impairment in the future 

index impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles goodwill and broadcast licenses accounted for and of total assets as of december  and december   respectively 
the interim and annual impairment tests for goodwill and broadcast licenses in accordance with the fasb s guidance for goodwill and intangible assets require us to make certain assumptions in determining fair value  including assumptions about the cash flow growth rates of our businesses 
additionally  the fair values are significantly impacted by factors including competitive industry valuations and long term interest rates that exist at the time the annual impairment tests are performed 
accordingly  we may incur additional impairment charges in future periods to the extent we do not achieve our expected cash flow growth rates  and to the extent that market values and long term interest rates in general decrease and increase  respectively 
the recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level  which is defined as either an operating segment or one level below an operating segment 
a component is a reporting unit when the component constitutes a business for which discreet financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of the component 
components may be combined into one reporting unit when they have similar economic characteristics 
we have three reporting units and we have allocated goodwill to two of them  the community newspaper and shoppers reporting unit and the broadcasting reporting unit 
we performed an interim impairment test for our community newspaper and shoppers reporting unit as of september  and performed our annual impairment test for both reporting units as of september  for purposes of testing the carrying values of goodwill related to our reporting units  we determine fair value by using an income and a market valuation approach 
the income approach uses expected cash flows for each reporting unit 
the cash flows are discounted for risk and time value 
in addition  the present value of the projected residual value is estimated and added to the present value of the cash flows 
the market approach is based on price multiples of publicly traded stocks of comparable companies to derive fair value 
each approach is weighted equally to determine a fair value estimate of each reporting unit 
for our community newspaper and shoppers reporting unit  we based our fair value estimates on various assumptions about our projected operating results  including continuing declines in publishing revenues as well as an expectation that we will achieve cash flow benefits from our continuing cost cutting measures 
the valuation methodology used to estimate the fair value of our reporting unit requires inputs and assumptions ie  market growth  operating cash flow margins and discount rates that reflect current market conditions as well as management judgment 
these assumptions may change due to changes in market conditions and such changes may result in an impairment of our goodwill 
for the broadcasting reporting unit  we based our fair value estimates  in large measure  on projected financial information which we believe to be reasonable 
however  actual future results may differ from those projections  and those differences may be material 
the valuation methodology used to estimate the fair value of our reporting unit requires inputs and assumptions ie  market growth  operating cash flow margins and discount rates that reflect current market conditions as well as management judgment 
for broadcast licenses at individual television and radio stations  we use an income approach to estimate fair value 
this approach uses the greenfield method  which assumes the start up of a new station by an independent market participant and incorporates assumptions that are based on past experiences and judgments about future market performance 
these variables include  but are not limited to the forecasted growth rate of each market including market population  household income and retail sales  estimated market share  profit margins and operating cash flows of an independent station within a market  estimated capital expenditures and start up costs  risk adjusted discount rate  likely media competition within the market and expected growth rates into perpetuity to estimate terminal values 
adverse changes in significant assumptions such as an increase in discount rates or a decrease in projected market revenues  market share or operating cash flows could result in additional non cash impairment charges on our broadcast licenses in future periods  which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we performed our annual impairment test on our broadcast licenses at individual television and radio stations in  which indicated three of our television broadcast licenses were impaired due to a decline in projected long term market revenues and an increase in the discount rates 
accordingly  we recorded a charge of million for the impairment of our broadcasting licenses 
accrued income taxes the internal revenue service irs and various state departments of revenue routinely examine our federal and state tax returns 
we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law  and we would vigorously defend these positions if challenged 
the final disposition of any positions challenged by the irs or state departments of revenue could require us to make additional tax payments or have an impact on our effective tax rate 
nonetheless  we believe that we have adequately reserved for any foreseeable payments related to such matters and consequently do not anticipate any material earnings impact from the ultimate resolution of such matters 
as of december  and december   our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties were million and million  respectively 

index we deduct broadcast licenses and tax deductible goodwill over a period of years from the date of acquisition 
the non cash broadcast license impairment charges recorded in and are not currently deductible for income tax purposes and have caused us to recognize deferred tax assets 
we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize a tax benefit for our deferred tax assets and we believe that they will be utilized to offset future taxable income over the next years in accordance with current income tax law 
in the future  we may be required to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets if we have future operating losses or reductions in our expected future profitability which would cause us to believe we would be unable to utilize them 
accrued litigation we are subject to various legal actions  administrative proceedings and claims 
when necessary  we record a liability for an estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of such claims 
the estimate would be developed in consultation with counsel and would be based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
we believe that such unresolved legal actions and claims would not materially affect our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
employee benefits we are self insured for a majority of our employee related health and disability benefits and workers compensation claims 
third party administrators are used to process all claims 
liabilities for unpaid claims are based on our historical claims experience 
liabilities for workers compensation claims are developed from actuarial valuations 
actual amounts could vary significantly from such estimates which would require us to record additional expense in the future 
there are certain assumptions that have a significant effect on our obligations  such as the discount rate used to arrive at the net present value of the obligations and expense  the return on assets used to estimate the growth in invested asset value available to satisfy certain obligations  the salary increases used to calculate the impact future pay increases will have on pension obligations  and the employee turnover statistics used to estimate the number of employees to be paid pension benefits 
the assumptions used in accounting for pension benefits and other postretirement benefits for and are pension benefits other postretirement benefits discount rate for expense discount rate for obligations rate of compensation increases for expense rate of compensation increases for obligations expected return on plan assets for our pension plans  as of december   a one percent increase or decrease in the discount rate would have the following effects in millions increase decrease effect on total of service and interest cost components in less than effect on pension benefit obligation as of december  to determine the discount rate assumptions for the pension and the other postretirement benefit plans  we studied our plans specific discount rate by matching our projected benefit payments to a yield curve developed from high grade corporate bonds 
the results of those studies were used as the benchmark to determine the discount rate assumptions 
we study historical markets to determine the long term rate of return assumption for pension plan assets 
we preserved the long term historical relationships between equities and fixed income securities consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long run 
we evaluate current market factors such as inflation and interest rates before we determine long term capital market assumptions 
we review peer data and historical returns to check for reasonability and appropriateness 

index we make other assumptions that affect the accounting for pension benefits  such as the rate of compensation increase 
changes in these assumptions affect the benefit obligations and the service and interest cost components of the pension plan and the other postretirement plan and the required funding of the pension plan 
we review these assumptions on an annual basis 
the discount rate and medical cost inflation assumptions could have a significant effect on our other postretirement benefits obligations 
the discount rate is used to arrive at the net present value of the obligation 
the health care cost trend rate is used to calculate the impact future medical costs would have on postretirement obligations 
a one percent increase or decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects increase decrease effect on total of service and interest cost components in less than less than effect on postretirement benefit obligation as of december  new accounting standards in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued amended guidance for goodwill impairment 
the guidance simplifies how entities test goodwill for impairment 
the new guidance allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
under these amendments  an entity will be required to perform the two step impairment test only if it concludes that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not  less than its carrying value 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
we will adopt this guidance in the first quarter of we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued amended guidance for comprehensive income

in december  the fasb issued amended guidance for goodwill 
the guidance applies to entities that have recognized goodwill and have one or more reporting units whose carrying amount for purposes of performing step one of the goodwill impairment test is zero or negative 
the guidance modifies step one so that for those reporting units  an entity is required to perform step two of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
in determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists  an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist 
the qualitative factors are consistent with existing guidance  which requires that goodwill of a reporting unit be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk stemming from changes in interest rates on our long term notes payable to banks  which are borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility  and in prices for newsprint 
changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our net earnings and cash flows 
interest rates on our long term notes payable to banks are variable 
our borrowings from extending lenders under the secured credit facility incur interest at either libor plus a margin that ranges from basis points to basis points  depending on our leverage  or i the base rate  which equals the highest of the prime rate set by us bank national association  the federal funds rate plus basis points or one month libor plus basis points  plus ii a margin that ranges from basis points to basis points  depending on our leverage 
average interest rates on borrowings under our revolving credit facility ranged from at the beginning of to at the end of if interest rates had been basis points higher  our annual interest expense would have increased million  assuming comparable borrowing levels
