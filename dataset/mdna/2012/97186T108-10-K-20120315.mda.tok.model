item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion presents management s analysis of our results of operations and financial condition as of and for each of the years in the three year period ended december  the discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes related thereto which appear elsewhere in this report 
executive overview introduction wilshire bancorp  inc succeeded to the business and operations of wilshire state bank the bank upon consummation of the reorganization of the bank into a holding company structure  effective as of august  we operate a community bank in the general commercial banking business  with our primary market encompassing the multi ethnic population of the los angeles metropolitan area 
our full service offices are located primarily in areas where a majority of the businesses are owned by korean speaking immigrants  with many of the remaining businesses owned by hispanic and other minority groups 
on june   we acquired the banking operations of mirae bank from the fdic  which had been named receiver of the institution 
we acquired approximately million in assets and assumed million in liabilities 
this included million in loans  and million in deposits in addition to five branch offices 
the integration of former mirae was successfully completed in the third quarter of  during which out of the branches were merged as a result of their close proximity to our existing office locations 
even with the branch mergers  the retention rate for former mirae deposit customers remained high 
over the past several years  our network of branches and lpos has expanded geographically 
we currently maintain twenty four branch offices and eight lpos 
we recently expanded our network of lpos and established two new offices in newark  california  and bellevue  washington 
we believe that our market coverage complements our multi ethnic small business focus 
we intend to be cautious about our growth strategy in future years regarding opening of additional branches and lpos 
we expect to continue implementing our growth strategy using strategic planning and market analysis  as our needs and resources permit 
in december  we issued  shares of newly designated series a preferred stock  each with a stated liquidation amount of  per share  and an attached warrant exercisable initially for  shares of our common stock  with an exercise price of per share  to the us treasury in exchange for the us treasury s million investment in the tarp capital purchase program 
this additional capital infusion from the united states government further strengthened our capital ratios  allowing us to continue to assist the financial markets with much needed liquidity via careful lending to qualified borrowers 
at december   we had approximately billion in assets  billion in total loans  and billion in deposits 
we also have expanded and diversified our business geographically by focusing on the continued development of the east coast market 
key performance indicators we believe the following were key indicators of our operations during our total assets decreased to billion at the end of  or a decrease of from billion at the end of our total deposits decreased to billion at the end of  or a decrease of from billion at the end of 
table of contents our total loans decreased to billion at the end of  or a decrease of from billion at the end of total net interest income before provision for loan losses decreased to million in  or a decline of  from million in the decrease in net interest income was a result of decrease in total loans  our largest source of interest income 
provision for losses on loans and loan commitments decreased from million at december   to million at december   a decrease of million or 
total noninterest income decreased to million in  a decrease of from million in the decrease in noninterest income was due to the reduction in gains from the sale of investments in addition to an increase in valuation allowance on held for sale loans 
total noninterest expense increased to million in or from million in the increase is mainly due to an increase in professional fees and in particular legal fees related to credit quality issues 
net loss available for common shareholders for increased to a loss of million or per basic and diluted common share  compared with a net loss of million  or per basic and diluted common share in the increase in net income was primarily attributable to a decrease in provisions for losses on loans and loan commitments in compared to  provisions decreased by million to million in the decrease in provisions helped to offset the million in tax expenses mainly due to the valuation allowance expense recorded in the first quarter of the decrease in provisions for losses on loans and loan commitments is a result of improvement in credit quality and a reduction in problem loan sales in compared to critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  and has been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
various elements of our accounting policies  by their nature  are inherently subject to estimation techniques  valuation assumptions  and other subjective assessments 
in particular  we have identified several accounting policies that  due to judgments  estimates  and assumptions inherent in those policies are critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements 
these policies relate to the classification and valuation of investment securities  the methodologies that determine our allowance for loan losses  the treatment of non accrual loans  the valuation of properties acquired through foreclosure  the valuation of retained interests and mortgage servicing assets related to the sales of sba loans  and the treatment and valuation of stock based compensation and business combination 
in each area  we have identified the variables most important in the estimation process 
we have used the best information available to make the estimates necessary to value the related assets and liabilities 
actual performance that differs from our estimates and future changes in the key variables could change future valuation and impact net income 

table of contents investment securities our investment policy seeks to provide and maintain liquidity  and to produce favorable returns on investments without incurring unnecessary interest rate or credit risk  while complementing our lending activities 
our investment securities portfolio is subject to interest rate risk 
fluctuations in interest rates may cause actual prepayments to vary from the estimated prepayments over the life of a security 
this may result in adjustments to the amortization of premiums or accretion of discounts related to these instruments  consequently changing the net yield on such securities 
reinvestment risk is also associated with the cash flows from such securities 
the unrealized gain loss on such securities may also be adversely impacted by changes in interest rates 
under asc  investment securities that management has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and recorded at amortized cost 
securities not classified as held to maturity or trading  with readily determinable fair values  are classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value 
purchase premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income using the interest method over the estimated lives of the securities 
the classification and accounting for investment securities are discussed in detail in notes and of the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report 
under asc  investment securities generally must be classified as held to maturity  available for sale  or trading 
the appropriate classification is based partially on our ability to hold the securities to maturity and largely on management s intentions with respect to either holding or selling the securities 
the classification of investment securities is significant since it directly impacts the accounting for unrealized gains and losses on securities 
unrealized gains and losses on trading securities flow directly through earnings during the periods in which they arise 
investment securities that are classified as held to maturity are recorded at amortized cost 
unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities are recorded as a separate component of shareholders equity accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and do not affect earnings until realized or deemed to be other than temporarily impaired 
the fair values of investment securities are generally determined by reference to market prices obtained from an independent external pricing service provider 
in obtaining such valuation information from third parties  we have evaluated the methodologies used to develop the resulting fair values 
we perform an analysis on the broker quotes received from third parties to ensure that the prices represent a reasonable estimate of the fair value 
the procedures include  but are not limited to  initial and on going review of third party pricing methodologies  review of pricing trends  and monitoring of trading volumes 
we ensure whether prices received from independent brokers represent a reasonable estimate of fair value through the use of internal and external cash flow models developed based on spreads  and when available  market indices 
as a result of this analysis  if we determine there is a more appropriate fair value based upon the available market data  the price received from the third party is adjusted accordingly 
prices from third party pricing services are often unavailable for securities that are rarely traded or are traded only in privately negotiated transactions 
we are obligated to assess  at each reporting date  whether there is an other than temporary impairment to our investment securities 
impairments related to credit issued must be recognized in current earnings rather than in other comprehensive income 
the determination of other than temporary impairment is a subjective process involving assessment of valuation and changes in such valuations resulting from deteriorating credit worthiness 
we examine all individual securities that are in an unrealized loss position at each reporting date for other than temporary impairment 
specific investment related factors we examine to assess impairment include the nature of the investment  severity and duration of the loss  the probability that we will be unable to collect all amounts due  and analysis of the issuers of the securities and whether there has been any cause for default on the securities and any change in the rating of the securities by the various rating agencies 
additionally  we evaluate whether the creditworthiness of the issuer calls the realization of contractual cash flows into question 
we reexamine the financial resources  intent  and the overall ability of the 
table of contents company to hold the securities until their fair values recover 
management does not believe that there are any investment securities  other than those identified in the current and previous periods  which are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired as of december  investment securities are discussed in more detail in note and in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements presented later in this report 
as required under financial accounting standards board fasb asc  we consider all available information relevant to the collectability of the security  including information about past events  current conditions  and reasonable and supportable forecasts  when developing the estimate of future cash flows and making other than temporary impairment assessment for our portfolio of residual securities and pooled trust preferred securities 
we consider factors such as remaining payment terms of the security  prepayment speeds  and the financial condition of the issuer s  expected defaults  and the value of any underlying collateral 
as of december  and december   no investment securities were determined to have any other than temporary impairment 
the unrealized losses on our government sponsored enterprises gse bonds  collateralized mortgage obligations cmos  and mortgage backed securities mbs are attributable to both changes in interest rates and a repricing risk in the market 
all gse bonds  gse cmo  and gse mbs securities are backed by us government sponsored and federal agencies and therefore rated aaa 
we have no exposure to the subprime market in the form of asset backed securities abs and collateralized debt obligations cdos that had previously been rated aaa but have since been downgraded to below investment grade 
we have the intent and ability to hold the securities in an unrealized loss position at december  and until the market value recovers or the securities mature 
municipal bonds and corporate bonds are evaluated by reviewing the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market conditions 
the unrealized losses on our investment in municipal and corporate securities were primarily attributable to both changes in interest rates and a repricing risk in the market 
we do not intend to sell the municipal bonds and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the securities before recovery of the amortized cost basis as of december  small business administration loans certain sba loans that may be sold prior to maturity have been designated as held for sale at origination and are recorded at the lower of cost or market value  determined on an aggregate basis 
a valuation allowance is established if the market value of such loans is lower than their cost  and operations are charged or credited for valuation adjustments 
when we sell a loan  we usually sell the guaranteed portion of the loan and retain the non guaranteed portion 
we receive sales proceeds from i the guaranteed principal of the loan  ii the deferred premium for the difference between the book value of the retained portion and the fair value allocated to the retained portion  and iii the loan excess servicing fee esf 
at the time of sale  the deferred premium  which is amortized over the remaining life of the loan as an adjustment to yield  is recorded for the difference between the book value and the fair value allocated to the retained portion 
the sales gain is recognized from the difference between the proceeds and the book value allocated to the sold portion 
we allocate the book value of the related loans among three portions on the basis of their relative fair value i the sold portion  ii the retained portion  and iii the esf 
we estimate the fair value of each portion based on the following 
the amount received for the sale represents the fair value of the sold portion 
the fair value of the retained portion is computed by discounting its future cash flows over the estimated life of the loan 
we calculate the fair value of the esf for the loan from the cash in flow of the net servicing fee over the estimated life of the loan  discounted at an above average discount rate and a range of constant prepayment rates of the related loans 

table of contents we capitalize the fair value allocated to esf in two categories i intangible servicing assets the contracted servicing fee less normal servicing costs  and ii interest only strip  or i o strip  receivables excess of esf over the contracted servicing fee 
the servicing asset is recorded based on the present value of the contractually specified servicing fee  net of servicing cost  over the estimated life of the loan  with an average discount rate and a range of constant prepayment rates of the related loans 
prior to december   the servicing asset was amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated servicing income 
for purposes of measuring impairment  the servicing assets are stratified by collateral types 
management periodically evaluates the fair value of servicing assets for impairment 
a valuation allowance is recorded when the fair value is below the carrying amount and a recovery of the valuation allowance is recorded when its fair value exceeds the carrying amount 
however  a reversal may not exceed the original valuation allowance recorded 
on january   we adopted asc and selected a fair value measurement method to measure our servicing assets and liabilities and recognized a onetime increase in their fair value of  net of tax effects 
any subsequent increase or decrease in fair value of servicing assets and liabilities is to be included in our current earnings in the statement of operations 
an interest only strip is recorded based on the present value of the excess of future interest income  over the contractually specified servicing fee  calculated using the same assumptions as noted above 
interest only strips are accounted for at their estimated fair values  with unrealized gains recorded as an adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
if the estimated fair value is less than its carrying value  the loss is considered as other than temporary impairment and it is charged to the current earnings 
allowance for loan losses accounting for the allowance for loan losses involves significant judgment and assumptions by management and is based on historical data and management s view of the current economic environment 
at least on a quarterly basis  our management reviews the methodology and adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and reports its assessment to the board of directors for its review and approval 
we base our allowance for loan losses on an estimate of probable losses in our loan portfolio 
our methodology for assessing loan loss allowances is intended to reduce the differences between estimated and actual losses and involves a detailed analysis of our loan portfolio in three phases the specific review of individual loans in accordance with asc the segmenting and reviewing of loan pools with similar characteristics in accordance with asc  and our judgmental estimate based on various qualitative factors 
the first phase of our allowance analysis involves the specific review of individual loans to identify and measure impairment 
at this phase  we evaluate each loan except for homogeneous loans  such as automobile loans and home mortgages 
specific risk rated loans are deemed impaired with respect to all amounts  including principal and interest  which will likely not be collected in accordance with the contractual terms of the related loan agreement 
impairment for commercial and real estate loans is measured either based on the present value of the loan s expected future cash flows or  if collection on the loan is collateral dependent  the estimated fair value of the collateral  less selling and holding costs 
the second phase involves segmenting the remainder of the risk rated loan portfolio into groups or pools of loans  together with loans with similar characteristics for evaluation in accordance with asc we perform loss migration analysis and calculate the loss migration ratio for each loan pool based on its historical net losses and benchmark it against the levels of other peer banks 
in the third phase  we consider relevant internal and external factors that may affect the collectability of a loan portfolio and each group of loan pools 
as a general rule  the factors listed 
table of contents below will be considered to have no impact to our loss migration analysis 
however  if information exists to warrant adjustment to the loss migration ratios  the changes will be made in accordance with the established parameters and supported by narrative and or statistical analysis 
we use a credit risk matrix to determine the impact to the loss migration analysis 
this matrix enables management to adjust the general allocation based on the loss migration ratio 
the factors currently considered are  but are not limited to concentration of credit  delinquency trend  nature and volume of loan trend  non accrual and problem loan trends  loss and recovery trend  quality loan review  lending and management staff  lending policies and procedures  and external factors such as changes in legal and regulatory requirements  on the level of estimated credit losses in the current portfolio 
for all factors  the extent of the adjustment will be commensurate with the severity of the conditions that concern each factor 
the evaluation of the inherent loss with respect to these factors is subject to a higher degree of uncertainty because they are not identified with specific problem credits or portfolio components 
central to our credit risk management and our assessment of appropriate loss allowance is our loan risk rating system 
under this system  the originating credit officer assigns borrowers an initial risk rating based on a thorough analysis of each borrower s financial capacity in conjunction with industry and economic trends 
approvals are made based upon the amount of inherent credit risk specific to the transaction and are reviewed for appropriateness by senior line and credit administration personnel 
credits are monitored by line and credit administration personnel for deterioration in a borrower s financial condition which may impact the ability of the borrower to perform under the contract 
although management has allocated a portion of the allowance to specific loans  specific loan pools  including off balance sheet credit exposures which are reported separately as part of other liabilities  the adequacy of the allowance is considered in its entirety 
non accrual loan policy interest on loans is credited to income as earned and is accrued only if deemed collectible 
accrual of interest is discontinued when a loan is over days delinquent unless management believes the loan is adequately collateralized and in the process of collection 
generally  payments received on nonaccrual loans are recorded as principal reductions 
interest income is recognized after all principal has been repaid or an improvement in the condition of the loan has occurred that would warrant resumption of interest accruals 
held for sale loans pursuant to asc a long lived asset to be sold is classified as held for sale when all of the following criteria are met  a 
management has authority to approve and commit to selling the asset b 
the asset is immediately available for sale c 
a plan to sell has been completed including actively locating buyers d 
the sale is probable within year and is expected to qualify as a sale e 
the asset is actively being marketed for sale at a reasonably price f 
the plan to sell indicates it is unlikely that significant change to the plan will be made or the plan will be withdrawn 
if the company has the intention to sell a note and if all of the criteria above are met  then the loan is be categorized as held for sale as of the date the decision is made 
once classified as held for sale  the loan is measured at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value 
provisions and reserves are recorded to reflect a decline in fair value if the fair value is less than the loan carrying amount 
any subsequence decline or increase in fair value for held for sale loans are accounted for as 
table of contents an increase or decrease in valuation allowance for held for sale loans which directly affects earnings 
when a classified as held for sale  the discount or premium is not amortized  but interest and expenses related to the note continue to be accrued 
loans transferred to held for sale continue to be recorded the same past due and nonaccrual treatment as other loans  if necessary 
a valuation allowance may be recorded on loans categorized as held for sale and not sold in subsequent quarters if the value of the loan or underlying property declines based on quoted prices or appraisals 
once a loan has been sold  the difference between the purchase price and the fair value is measured against net income as a gain or loss on sale of loans 
valuation of other real estate owned other real estate owned oreo  which represents real estate acquired through foreclosure  or deed in lieu of foreclosure in satisfaction of commercial and real estate loans  is carried at the estimated fair value less the selling costs of the real estate 
the fair value of the property is based upon a current appraisal 
the difference between the fair value of the real estate collateral and the loan balance at the time of transfer is recorded as a loan charge off if fair value is lower than the loan balance 
subsequent to foreclosure  management periodically performs valuations and the oreo property is carried at the lower of carrying value or fair value  less cost to sell 
the determination of a property s estimated fair value incorporates i revenues projected to be realized from disposal of the property  ii construction and renovation costs  iii marketing and transaction costs  and iv holding costs eg  property taxes  insurance and homeowners association dues 
any subsequent declines in the fair value of the oreo property after the date of transfer are recorded through a write down of the asset 
any subsequent operating expenses or income  reduction in estimated fair values  and gains or losses on disposition of such properties are charged or credited to current operations 
goodwill and intangible assets we recognized goodwill and intangible assets in connection with the acquisition of liberty bank of new york  and from the mirae bank acquisition 
as of december  goodwill stood unchanged from the previous year at million  all of which is related to the liberty bank acquisition located in the east coast 
million and million  respectively  in core deposits intangibles were recorded as a result of the liberty bank and mirae bank acquisition 
core deposit intangibles had cost bases of  and  related to the liberty bank and mirae bank transaction  respectively 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the sum of the estimated fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired less the estimated fair value of the liabilities assumed 
we recognized goodwill of approximately million in connection with the acquisition of liberty bank of new york in  currently our four east coast branches 
goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value 
the goodwill impairment analysis is a two step test 
the first step  used to identify potential impairment  involves comparing the east coast branches estimated fair value to its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value  goodwill is considered not to be impaired 
if the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value  there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure for actual impairment  if any exists 
if required  the second step involves calculating an implied fair value of goodwill 
this fair value amount is determined in a manner similar to the way goodwill is calculated in a business combination  by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the unit  as determined in the first step  over the aggregate estimated fair values of the individual assets  liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the unit was being acquired in a business combination 
if the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the 
table of contents carrying value of goodwill  there is no impairment 
if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment charge is recorded for the excess and a new basis is established for goodwill 
an impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying value of goodwill 
during the fourth quarter of  management performed an evaluation of goodwill related to the east coast branches and concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill and that the fair value of the east coast branches exceeded its carrying value as of december  the determination was based on the company s goodwill impairment analysis  which was performed in accordance with asc the company performed step of the goodwill impairment which indicated that the fair value of the east coast branches exceeded the carrying value 
however  certain assumptions used in step of the goodwill impairment analysis had a degree of uncertainty as to future outcomes 
some of these key assumptions used in step of the analysis included future growth assumptions of the east coast branches  equity retention rates  and the estimated allowance for loan losses for the east coast branches for future periods 
management ran sensitivity stress tests on certain assumptions used in step of the goodwill impairment analysis stressing growth assumptions in addition to other factors used in the step analysis 
even under the stress scenarios  the fair value continued to excess the carry value of equity for the east coast branches 
therefore  management concluded that goodwill related to the east coast branches was not impaired as of december   based on the results of the impairment analysis 
the company will continue to monitor the performance of the east coast branches and perform an analysis for goodwill impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently  as needed 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enacted date 
generally  income tax expense is the sum of two components current tax expense and deferred tax expense benefit 
current tax expense is calculated by applying the current tax rate to taxable income 
deferred tax expense is recorded as deferred tax assets liabilities change from year to year 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent the tax effects  based on current tax law  of future deductible or taxable amounts attributable to events that have been recognized in our financial statements 
because we traditionally recognize substantially more expenses in our financial statements than we have been allowed to deduct for taxes  we generally have a net deferred tax asset 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
at december  we had no deferred tax assets due to valuation allowance recorded during the year 
in  we adopted the provision of fasb asc which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with asc  income taxes 
asc provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits 
a tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination  with a tax examination being presumed to occur 
the amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized on examination 
for tax positions not meeting the more likely than not test  results in no tax benefit 
table of contents being recorded 
the company recognized an increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefit of  and related interest of  in and recognized an increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefit of  and related interest of  in as of december   the total unrecognized tax benefit that would affect the effective rate if recognized was  and related interest was sba guaranteed loan sales in december  fasb issued accounting standards update asu accounting for transfers of financial assets  to codify fasb statement is revision to statement no 
accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
codified at asc  the guidance requires more information about transfer of financial assets  including securitization transactions and where companies have continuing exposure to the risks related to transferred financial assets 
the statement is to improve the relevance  representational faithfulness  and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial statements about a transfer of financial assets  the effects of a transfer on its financial position  financial performance and cash flows  and a transferor s continuing involvement  if any  in transferred financial assets 
as of january  implementation date  the guidance changed the company s categorization of sba guaranteed portions of loans sold to third parties purchasers 
due to the following recourse provisions  sales accounting was not applied to these transactions if borrower makes the first three payments required by the note after the warranty date the date the agreement is settled by the bank and registered holder through fta in which they are due and the payments are the full amounts required by the note  the bank has no liability to refund the premium 
if the borrower prepays the loan for any reason within the days of the warranty date  the bank must refund any premium received 
if the bank fails to make the first three monthly payments due after the warranty date and the borrower enters uncured default within calendar days from the warranty date  the bank shall refund any premium received 
borrower payments must be received by the bank in the month in which they are due and must be full payments as defined in the borrower s note 
if a transfer of a portion of a loan does not meet the participation definition  the transfer was treated as a secured borrowing with a pledge of collateral 
prior to the issuance of this statement  sba guaranteed portions sold to third parties were treated as loans before and after the sale of the loan as sales accounting treatment was applied 
however under this guidance  we previously classified sba guaranteed portions of loans as secured borrowings and the recognition of gain on sale of sba guaranteed loans was delayed by at least days until the recourse provisions expired  and during that period  the loan balances were grossed up and payment received were accounted for as secured borrowings 
as of february   all guaranteed portions of sba loans sold did not have any warranty or recourse periods 
the small business administration made changes to the sale of guaranteed portions of sba loans that effectively removed any recourse provisions and thereby immediately qualified any loans sold after february  as sales transactions 

table of contents results of operations net interest income and net interest margin our primary source of revenue is net interest income  which is the difference between interest and fees derived from earning assets and interest paid on liabilities obtained to fund those assets 
our net interest income is affected by changes in the level and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  referred to as volume changes 
our net interest income is also affected by changes in the yields earned on assets and rates paid on liabilities  referred to as rate changes 
interest rates charged on our loans are affected principally by the demand for such loans  the supply of money available for lending purposes  and competitive factors 
those factors are  in turn  affected by general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control  such as federal economic policies  the general supply of money in the economy  legislative tax policies  the governmental budgetary matters  and the actions of the federal reserve board 
our average net loans were billion in  as compared with billion in and billion in  representing a decrease of in and an increase of in from each of the prior annual periods 
the decrease in loans in was largely a result of problem loan sales transaction throughout the year in addition to a decline in loan originations 
average interest earning assets were billion in  as compared with billion in and billion in  representing a decrease of in and an increase of in from each of the prior annual periods 
our average interest bearing deposits decreased by to billion in and increased by to billion in  as compared with billion in together with other borrowings see financial condition deposits and other sources of funds below  average interest bearing liabilities decreased to billion in and increased by to billion in  as compared with an increase of to billion in our yields on interest earnings assets were in  in  and in average yield on interest earning assets decreased to in compared to in primarily due to loan interest income reversals as a result of an increase in non accrual loans in as credit quality improved  total interest income reversal were reduced on non accrual loans which helped to increase yield on earnings assets to for the twelve months ended december  total interest income declined in to million and declined in to million  down from million in the decrease from to was largely related to the overall decline in loan balances year over year 
interest expense meanwhile has continued to decline  decreasing to million in and to million in  as compared with million in the decline in interest expense for and was attributable to a steady reduction in deposit rates throughout these periods 
the combined result of our growth particularly in core deposits  and careful monitoring efforts with respect to cost of funds resulted in an increase in our net interest income in however in  the decline in total loans during the year resulted in a decline in total interest income resulting in a decline in our net interest income for compared with the previous year 
net interest income before provision for losses on loan and loan commitments decreased  or million  to million in and increased  or million  to million in  following an increase of  or million  in to million 
as a result of our lowered cost of funds in and  our net interest spread increased from in to in  and again increased to in net interest margin increased to in compared to in and in

loans are net of the allowance for loan losses  deferred fees  unearned income  and related direct costs  but include those placed on non accrual status 
provision for loan losses and provision for loan commitments in anticipation of credit risks inherent in our lending business and the recent ongoing financial crisis  we set aside allowances through charges to earnings 
such charges were made not only for our outstanding loan portfolio  but also for off balance sheet items  such as commitments to extend credits or letters of credit 
the charges made for our outstanding loan portfolio were credited to allowance for loan losses  whereas charges for off balance sheet items were credited to the reserve for off balance sheet items  which are presented as a component of other liabilities 
through the enhancement of our loan underwriting standards  proactive credit follow up procedures  and aggressive disposal of problem loans through charge offs and note sales  we experienced a substantial improvement in our overall credit quality related to the loan portfolio 
our provision for losses on loan and loan commitments decreased by to million in and 
table of contents increased to million in from million in the increase in provisions from to was largely a result of charge offs related to note sales as management sought to reduce the number of problem loans in the portfolio through sales transactions 
the improvement in credit quality coupled with a reduction in overall loan charge offs resulted in a reduction in provision for loan losses from to the problem loan sales helped reduce non performing and potential non performing loans from the portfolio reducing the need to continue to dispose of problem loans in the same manner in total charge offs in totaled million compared to million in and million in provision expense of million for included the recapture of provision for losses for loan commitments totaling  while the million provision in was inclusive of million provision for losses on loan commitments  and the million provision in included million in provisions for loan commitments 
the procedures for monitoring the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  as well as detailed information concerning the allowance itself  are described in the section entitled allowance for loan losses and loan commitments below 
noninterest income total noninterest income decreased to million in  compared to million in  and million in noninterest income was of average assets in  decreased from and of average assets in and  respectively 
we currently earn noninterest income from various sources  including deposit fees  gains from the sale of loans and securities  and income stream provided by bank owned life insurance  or boli  in the form of an increase in cash surrender value 
the following table sets forth the various components of our noninterest income for the periods indicated noninterest income dollars in thousands for the years ended december  amount amount amount gain from acquisition of mirae bank service charges on deposit accounts gain on sale of loans  net loan related servicing fees gain on sale or call of securities valuation of loans held for sale other income total average assets non interest income as a of average assets our largest source of noninterest income in was the gain relating to the acquisition of mirae bank  which represented of total noninterest income 
there were no gains on acquisition recorded in or the million acquisition gain was recorded as a bargain purchase gain which resulted from the difference between the total fair value of assets acquired in the amount of million  less million in fair value of liabilities acquired from the acquisition of mirae bank 

table of contents our services charges on deposits was the largest source of noninterest income for and accounted for of total noninterest income  and totaled million  million and million for the twelve months ended december    and  respectively 
although total deposits declined from to  service charges on deposit accounts remained relatively unchanged 
increases in service charge fees in addition to an increase in analysis fee charges on demand deposit accounts helped to maintain consistent levels of service charge income on deposit accounts 
analysis fees charges increased as total demand deposit accounts have increase year over year from to we constantly review service charge rates to maximize service charge income while maintaining a competitive edge in our markets 
net gain on sale of loans  representing approximately of our total noninterest income in was our next largest source of noninterest income 
gain on sale of loans increased from million in to million in  but then decreased to million in the decrease is attributable to losses from the sale of problem loans in which are included in gain on sale of loans and is netted out 
historically  this source of noninterest income was derived primarily from the sale of the guaranteed portion of sba loans which are sold in the secondary market for government securities while we retain the associated servicing rights 
however in recent years  gains and losses from the sale of problem loans and mortgage loans became a larger portion of the total gain on sale of loans 
gains from the sale of guaranteed portions of sba loans totaled million for  compared to million at the end of  and million at the sale of problem loans resulted in a net loss of million in  compared to a gain of  in  and a loss of  in gains from the sale of mortgage loans totaled   and  for years ended   and  respectively 
our third largest source of noninterest income in was loan related servicing fees  which represented approximately of our total noninterest income 
this fee income consists of trade financing fees and servicing fees on sba loans sold 
with our previous expansion of our trade financing activities and the growth of our servicing loan portfolio  fee income has generally increased year over year 
in  loan related servicing fees increased to million  as compared to million in and million in the servicing fee income on sold loans is credited when we collect the monthly payments on the sold loans we are servicing and charged by the monthly amortization of servicing rights and interest only  or i o strips that we originally capitalized upon sale of the related loans 
such servicing rights and i o strips are also charged against the loan service fee income account when the sold loans are paid off 
our liquidity position in and was strengthened as a result of strong deposit growth particularly core deposits 
our liquidity strength allowed us to profit from gains on the sale of securities 
gains from security sales and calls totaled million in down from million in gain on sale or call of securities for was much smaller at  as there were no investments sold during the year 
we did not sell investment in as the reinvestment rate was very low compared to our portfolio yield and selling investment would have put significant downward pressure on our net interest margin 
as such we felt it more prudent to continue to earn interest income from these investments than to sell them for gains 
the  represents gains that resulted from securities that were called during the year 
valuation of loans held for sale is recorded on loans previously categorized as held for sale which were not sold in subsequent quarters 
if the value of loans  or underlying properties  declines in value based on quoted prices or appraisals  a valuation allowance is recorded to reflect the reduction in value 
valuation allowance on loans held for sale totaled million in or of total noninterest income 
there was no recorded valuation allowance on loans held for sale during or the bulk of the valuation allowance was recorded on problem loans categorized as held for sale during

other income increased to million for  compared to million in  and million in noninterest expense total noninterest expense increased to million in from million in and million in the increase in and compared to was due largely to increases in oreo expenses and professional fees  specifically audit and legal fees 
these fees have increased each period as we experienced deterioration in credit quality which in turn increased the cost related to oreo provisions and loss on sale of oreo 
legal fees increased due to the costs associated with foreclosures and legal fees associated with non performing loans  and legal costs from the internal investigation and class action lawsuit

however  in the last few years  salaries and benefits accounted for less than half of total noninterest expense and decreased further to in as other noninterest expense increased 
additional staffing was necessitated by our new office and branch openings  business growth  and the acquisition of mirae bank in and however  by  we successfully controlled and maintained our total number of employees through effective allocation of our human resources

professional fees were million  million  and million  or   and of total noninterest expense  in   and  respectively 
professional fees increased by million from to as a result of an increase in legal fees totaling million 
the million increase from to was mostly due to a large increase in accounting and auditing fees which increased by million during legal fees also increased as a result of credit quality issues  our internal investigation  and costs related to the class action lawsuit 
regulatory assessment fee expenses represent fdic insurance premium assessments 
in  these expenses decreased to million  or of total noninterest expense  from million in  and million in deposit insurance premiums decreased  in compared to due to the decrease in deposits and change in assessment calculation 
as a result of the dodd frank act  the method of calculating the fdic insurance premium assessment has changed to a calculation which is based on an institution s average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity  whereas previously the calculation was based on total domestic deposits of an institution 
net loss on sale of oreo totaled million for  or of total non interest expense 
net loss on sale of oreo for totaled million and there was a gain on net oreo sales of  in the increase in loss on sale of oreo from to and then to is primarily due to the increase in loan foreclosures to oreo and oreo sales transactions that resulted from the credit deterioration experienced in the loan portfolio 
with improvement in credit quality and reduction in oreos  we expect these expenses to decline in the subsequent year 
data processing expenses increased to million which represent of total noninterest expense for this compares to data processing expenses of million in and million in the increase in data processing expenses in corresponded to the growth of our business as a result of the acquisition of mirae bank 
one time costs associated with the acquisition were expensed in as well 
data processing fees were decreased in due to the absence of further one time costs in addition to the streamlining of mirae bank data 
however  these expenses increased by  in compared to loss on investment in low income housing tax credit lihtc investments represented of total noninterest expenses and totaled million in this compares with million in expense for and no related expense in the company uses equity method when accounting for partnership interest 
the loss is related to current period losses allocated from the equity method of valuation in advertising and promotional expenses decreased to million in after having increased to million in from million in advertising and promotional expenses represented of total noninterest expense for these expenses represent marketing activities  such as media advertisements and promotional gifts for customers of newly opened offices  especially in relatively new 
table of contents areas such as the east coast market in new york and new jersey 
the expenses have remained fairly steady with no large fluctuations from to outsourced service costs for customers are payments made to third parties who provide services that were traditionally provided by banks to their customers  such as armored car services or bookkeeping services  and are recouped from the earnings credits earned by the respective depositors on their balances maintained with us 
due mainly to the increase in service activities and the increase in depositors demanding such services  our outsourced service costs generally rise in proportion with our business growth 
nonetheless  with our successful cost control measures and decrease in deposit balances  these expenses decreased to  in as compared to million in and million in all other noninterest expenses  made up of post retirement benefit costs  office supplies  loan fees  director fees  and other expenses decreased by  or  to million in from million in during other noninterest expense increased  or from million in a portion of the increase in represents a normal growth in association with the growth of our business activities and was in line with our expectation

the company  however  was able to partially realize federal tax benefit from low income housing tax credit funds see other earning assets for further discussion 
generally  income tax expense is the sum of two components current tax expense and deferred tax expense benefit 
current tax expense is calculated by applying the current tax rate to taxable income 
deferred tax expense is recorded as deferred tax assets liabilities change from year to year 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent the tax effects  based on current tax law  of future deductible or taxable amounts attributable to events that have been recognized in our financial statements 
because we traditionally recognize substantially more expenses in our financial statements than we have been allowed to deduct for taxes  we generally have a net deferred tax asset 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
during the first quarter of  the company reviewed its analysis of whether a valuation allowance should be recorded against its deferred tax assets 
the determination of whether a deferred tax asset is realizable is based on weighting all available evidence that can be objectively verified 
the estimated realization period for the deferred tax asset based on forecasts of future earnings extended further into year carry forward period 
this extended realization period  combined with the objective evidence of three year cumulative loss position represented significant negative evidence that caused the company to conclude that a full valuation allowance was required against the deferred tax asset as of march  except for the portion that could be realized through two year carryback of net operating losses at that time 
during the subsequent periods in  the company realized taxable income which effectively adjusted the deferred tax valuation allowance 
as of december   
table of contents valuation allowance for deferred tax asset was million and these remaining deferred tax asset valuation allowance will ultimately reverse through income tax expense if the company can demonstrate a sustainable return to profitability that would lead management to conclude that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be utilized during the carry forward period 
as of december  the company has taken full valuation allowance and had net deferred tax assets million 
as of december  and  we had net deferred tax assets of million and million  respectively 
on january   we adopted the provisions of asc  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
as a result of applying the provisions of asc  we recognized an increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefit of  and no related interest 
as of december   the total unrecognized tax benefit that would affect the effective rate if recognized was  the adjustment was solely related to the state exposure from california enterprise zone net interest deductions 
we do not expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next months 
as of the december   the total accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions was  we accounted for interest related to uncertain tax positions as part of our provision for federal and state income taxes 
we file united states federal and state income tax returns in jurisdictions with varying statues of limitations 
the through tax years generally remain subject to examination by federal and most state tax authorities 
as of december  the company is under examination by the new york state department of taxation and finance for the   and tax years 
examinations for the and tax years under the california franchise tax board are ongoing as well 
we believe that we have adequately provided or paid for income tax issues not yet resolved with federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
based upon consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances  we do not expect the examination results will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statement as of december  financial condition investment portfolio investments are one of our major sources of interest income and are acquired in accordance with a comprehensively written investment policy addressing strategies  categories  and levels of allowable investments 
this investment policy is reviewed at least annually by the board of directors 
management of our investment portfolio is set in accordance with strategies developed and overseen by our asset liability committee 
investment balances  including cash equivalents and interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions  are subject to change over time based on our asset liability funding needs and interest rate risk management objectives 
our liquidity levels take into consideration anticipated future cash flows and all available sources of credits and is maintained a level management believes is appropriate for future flexibility in meeting anticipated funding needs 
cash equivalents and interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions we sell federal funds  purchase securities under agreements to resell and high quality money market instruments  and deposit interest bearing accounts in other financial institutions to help meet liquidity requirements and provide temporary holdings until the funds can be otherwise deployed or invested

table of contents investment securities management of our investment securities portfolio focuses on providing an adequate level of liquidity and establishing a balanced interest rate sensitive position  while earning an adequate level of investment income without taking undue risks 
as of december   our investment portfolio was primarily comprised of united states government agency securities  accounting for of the entire investment portfolio 
our us government agency securities holdings are all prime conforming mortgage backed securities  or mbs  and collateralized mortgage obligations  or cmos  guaranteed by fnma  fhlmc  or gnma 
gnmas are considered equivalent to us treasury securities  as they are backed by the full faith and credit of the us government 
currently  there are no subprime mortgages in our investment portfolio 
besides the us government agency securities  we also have a investment in corporate debt and in municipal debt securities 
among this of our investment portfolio that was not comprised of us government securities   or million carry the top two highest investment grade rating of aaa aaa or aa aa  while  or million  carry an upper medium investment grade rating of at least a a  and  or million  is unrated 
our investment portfolio does not contain any government sponsored enterprises  or gse  preferred securities or any distressed corporate securities that had required other than temporary impairment charges as of december  in accordance with asc  recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments  an other than temporary impairment otti is recognized if the fair value of a debt security is lower than the amortized cost and if the debt security will be sold  it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovering the amortized cost or it is expected that not all of the amortized cost will be recovered 
credit related declines in the fair value of debt securities below their amortized cost that are deemed to be other than temporary are reflected in earnings as realized losses in the consolidated statements of operations 
declines related to factors aside from credit issues are reflected in other comprehensive income  net of taxes 
we classified our investment securities as held to maturity or available for sale pursuant to asc we adopted asc and asc effective january   and asc effective october  pursuant to the fair value election option of asc  we have chosen to continue classifying our existing instruments of investment securities as held to maturity or available for sale under asc investment securities that we intend to hold until maturity are classified as held to maturity securities  and all other investment securities are classified as available for sale 
the carrying values of available for sale investment securities are adjusted for unrealized gains and losses as a valuation allowance and any gain or loss is reported on an after tax basis as a component of other comprehensive income 
credit related declines in the fair value of held to maturity and available for sale securities below their cost that are deemed to be other than temporary are reflected in earnings as realized losses  and there were no such other than temporary impairment in the fair market values of our held to maturity and available for sale securities were respectively  and million as of december

declines in the fair value of held to maturity and available for sale securities below their cost that are deemed to be other than temporary are reflected in earnings as realized losses 
in estimating other than temporary impairment losses  we consider  among other things  i the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  ii the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and iii our intent and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
we performed detailed evaluation of the investment portfolio in assessing individual positions that have market values that have declined below cost 
in assessing whether there was other than temporary impairment  we considered in a disciplined manner whether or not all contractual cash flows due on a security will be collected  and our positive intent and ability to hold the debt security until recovery in fair value or maturity a number of factors are considered in the analysis  including but not limited to issuer s credit rating  likelihood of the issuer s default or bankruptcy  collateral underlying the security  industry in which the issuer operates  nature of the investment  severity and duration of the decline in fair value  and analysis of the average life and effective maturity of the security 
we do not believe that any individual unrealized loss as of december  represented an other than temporary impairment 
the unrealized losses on our gse bonds  gse cmos  and gse mbs were attributable to both changes in interest rate us treasury curve and a repricing of risk spreads widening against risk fee rate in the market 
we did not own any non agency mbs or cmo 
all gse bonds  gse cmo  and gse mbs securities are backed by us government sponsored and federal agencies and therefore rated aaa aaa 
we have no exposure to the subprime market in the form of asset backed securities  or abs  and collateralized debt obligations  or cdos that had previously been rated aaa aaa but have since been downgraded to below investment grade 
we have the intent and ability to hold the securities in an unrealized loss position at december  until the market value recovers or the securities mature 
municipal bonds and corporate bonds are evaluated by reviewing the credit worthiness of the issuer and general market conditions 
the unrealized losses on our investment in municipal and corporate securities were primarily attributable to both changes in interest rates and a repricing of risk in the market 
we have the intent and ability to hold the securities in an unrealized loss position at december  until the market value recovers or the securities mature

since a major real estate recession during the first part of the previous decade  property values in southern california and around the country had generally increased in the last year span from to since late  we have started to see below trend growth in gross domestic product gdp and a gradual decline of the real estate market in southern california and many other areas in the country 
the financial crisis worsened during the second half of and the first half of and we observed further decline in the real estate market across the nation through nonetheless  as of year end  of our loans are secured by first mortgages on various types of real estate 
we expect to see the decline in real estate values to continue into the first half of  so with the current economic conditions  property values may decline further in nonperforming assets nonperforming assets  or npas  consist of nonperforming loans  or npls  restructured loans  and other npas 
npls are reported at their outstanding balances  net of any portion guaranteed by sba  and consist of loans on non accrual status and loans days or more past due and still accruing interest 
restructured loans are loans of which the terms of repayment have been renegotiated  resulting in a reduction or deferral of interest or principal 
other npas consist of properties  mainly other real estate owned  or oreo  and repossessed vehicles  acquired by foreclosure or similar means that management intends to offer for sale 
the treatment of nonperforming status for held for sale loans is the same for as other loans and are accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value 
our continued emphasis on asset quality control enabled us to maintain a relatively low level of npls prior to however  the general economic condition of the us as well as the local economies in which we do business have shown a gradual decline as the housing sector and gdp growth continued to show weakness through the effect of the unfavorable economy environment impacted the strength of our borrowers credit and financial status which elevated npl levels during to however  through note sales and charge offs and enhanced monitoring of problem loans  npls  net of sba guaranteed portion decreased to million at the end of compared to million  million  million  and million at the end of    and  respectively 
at december   the npls as a percentage of total loans was  compared to    and at december     and  respectively 
although we experience a decline in non performing loans in  construction non performing loans increased from at december  to million at december  the increase was a result of one borrower with two construction loans related to low income housing tax credit developments 
the company was made aware that the tax credits applied for by the borrower was denied  seriously jeopardizing the development related to the loans 
although the loans were still performing in accordance with their initial terms at december   the denial in tax credits prompted a change in classification of the loans to non performing 
as of december   we had million in other npas  which was comprised of fourteen oreos  with thirteen of those foreclosed in we have listed these properties for sale or are directly selling these properties as of december  among these fourteen oreos  we have recorded million in provisions for eleven of the properties 
of the ten oreos sold in year  the bank recorded a loss of million 
as of december   we had million as other npas  which comprised of eighteen oreos  with fifteen of those foreclosed in among the eighteen oreos  we had recorded million in provisions for twelve of the properties 
of the seven oreos sold in year  the bank recorded a loss of million 
at december   we had million as other npas  which was comprised of fifteen oreos  with nine of those foreclosed in 
table of contents at december   we had million as other npas  which was comprised of eight oreos  with seven of those foreclosed in at the end of  the majority of our oreo was attributable to a single oreo valued at  which was foreclosed in the fourth quarter of together with oreo and repossessed vehicles  our ratio of npas as a percentage of total loans and other nonperforming assets equaled     and as of december      and  respectively 
management believes that the reserve provided for npas  together with the tangible collateral  were adequate as of december  see allowance for loan losses and loan commitments below for further discussion 
the following table provides information with respect to the components of our npas as of the dates indicated the figures in the table are net of the portion guaranteed by sba  with the total amounts adjusted and reconciled for the sba guaranteed portion for the gross npas non performing assets dollars in thousands for the years ended december  total non accrual loans net of sba guaranteed portions construction real estate secured commercial and industrial consumer total loans days or more past due and still accruing real estate secured commercial and industrial consumer total total non performing loans repossessed vehicles other real estate owned total non performing assets  net of sba guarantee troubled debt restructurings non performing loans as a percentage of total loans nonperforming assets  net of sba guarantee  as a percentage of total loans and other nonperforming assets allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans during the fiscal year ended december   no interest income related to these loans were included in net income

table of contents during the fiscal year ended december   no interest income related to this loan was included in net income 
additional interest income would be negligible during the year ended december   if this loan had been paid in accordance with its original term and had been outstanding throughout the fiscal year ended december  covered troubled debt restructurings at december  totaled million and is included in the table above 
allowance for loan losses and loan commitments based on the credit risk inherent in our lending business  we set aside allowance for losses on loans and loan commitments which is charged to earnings 
these charges were not only made for the outstanding loan portfolio  but also for off balance sheet loan commitments  such as commitments to extend credit or letters of credit 
the charges made for the outstanding loan portfolio were credited to the allowance for loan losses  whereas charges related to loan commitments were credited to the reserve for loan commitments  which is presented as a component of other liabilities 
the provision for losses on loans and loan commitments is discussed in the previous section entitled provision for loan losses and loan commitments 
the allowance for loan losses is comprised of two components  specific valuation allowance sva or allowance on impaired loans that are individually evaluated  and general valuation allowance gva or allowance on loans that are evaluated as pools based on historical experience and qualitative adjustments qa which are used to estimate losses not captured by historical experience 
historical loss experience used to calculate gva may not accurately capture true credit losses and trends 
therefore  management performs a review of the historical loss rates used in gva as well as the qa methodology due to the increased significance of gva when estimating losses in the current economic environment 
to establish an adequate allowance  we must be able to recognize when loans have become a problem 
a risk grade of either pass  special mention  substandard  or doubtful  is assigned to every loan in the loan portfolio  with the exception of homogeneous loans ie  home mortgage loans  home equity lines of credit  overdraft loans  express business loans  and automobile loans 
the following is a brief description of the loan classifications or risk grades used in our allowance calculation pass loans loans that are not past due more than days without signs of credit deterioration 
the financial condition of the borrower is sound as well as the status of any collateral 
loans secured by cash principal and interest also fall within this classification 
watch loans performing loans with borrowers with adverse financial trends  higher debt equity ratio  or weak liquidity positions  but not to the degree of being considered a problem loan 
special mention loans that are currently protected but exhibit an increasing degree of risk based on weakening credit strength and or repayment sources 
contingent or remedial plans to improve the bank s risk exposure should be documented 
substandard loans inadequately protected by the current worth and paying capacity of the obligor or pledged collateral  if any 
this grade is assigned when inherent credit weakness is apparent 
doubtful loans having all the weakness inherent in a substandard classification but with collection or liquidation highly questionable with the possibility of loss as some future date evident 
we currently use migration analysis as a factor in calculating our allowance for loan losses in addition to a software program used to produce historical loss rates for our gva estimations 
a qa matrix is also used to estimate losses not captured by historical experience 
for impaired loans  or sva allowance  we evaluate loans on an individual basis to determine impairment in accordance with 
table of contents generally accepted accounting principles or gaap 
all these components are added together for a final allowance for loan losses figure on a quarterly basis 
net charge offs in decreased to million compared to million in total net charge offs in were much higher compared to the previous years and due to the large amount of note sales transactions in and the discovery of a material weakness in our internal controls related to loan originations and underwriting  in addition to the weak business climate adversely impacted the financial condition of a number of our clients 
the net charge offs in were comprised of million in construction loan charge offs  million of real estate secured net loan charge offs  million of commercial and industrial loans net charge offs  and  consumer loan net charge offs 
the million in net charge offs represents of average total loans in  as compared with    and in   and  respectively 
with the improvement in credit quality experienced in in addition to the reduction in npas  allowance for loan losses declined million to million at december  compared to million at december  prior year allowance for loan losses totaled million  million  and million at december    and  respectively 
even with the decrease in allowance for loan losses and loan commitments experienced in  we were still able to maintain the adequate ratio of allowance for loan losses to gross loans at     and at the end of     and  respectively 
although management believes our allowance at december  was adequate to absorb losses from any known and inherent risks in the portfolio  economic conditions which adversely affect our service areas or other variables may result in further increased losses in the loan portfolio in the future

the average total deposit balances increased by  or million  in the average total deposit balances decreased  or million  in the decrease in deposits in was a result of management s planned deposit run off of higher costing time deposits and savings accounts 
as a result of the capital raise in the second quarter of and note sales throughout the year  the company experienced a large inflow of excess liquidity 
in order to limit the net interest margin compression from the excess liquidity  management implemented a strategy to reduce high cost deposits  particularly time deposits and savings accounts 
this was achieved through the gradual reduction in deposits rates for these accounts throughout the year 
our primary focus for was to improve our deposit mix and increase overall demand deposits accounts and balances 
this strategy will continue into as well 
due to our efforts in controlling the growth of expensive time deposits  the percentage of the average time deposits divided by average total deposits decreased to in from in and in this trend was evident again in with jumbo time deposits time deposits with balances of  or greater continuing to decrease along with other time deposits

asset liability management management seeks to ascertain optimum and stable utilization of available assets and liabilities as a vehicle to attain our overall business plans and objectives 
in this regard  management focuses on measurement and control of liquidity risk  interest rate risk and market risk  capital adequacy  operation risk and credit risk 
see risk factors for further discussion on these risks 
information concerning interest rate risk management is set forth under item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
liquidity management liquidity management involves our ability to meet cash flow requirements arising from fluctuations in deposit levels and demands of daily operations  which include funding of securities purchases  providing for customers credit needs and ongoing repayment of borrowings 
maintenance of adequate liquidity requires that sufficient resources be available at all time to meet our cash flow requirements 
liquidity in a banking institution is required primarily to provide for deposit withdrawals and the credit needs of its customers and to take advantage of investment opportunities as they arise 
liquidity management involves our ability to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without incurring significant loss  and to raise cash or maintain funds without incurring excessive additional cost 
our liquidity is actively managed on a daily basis and reviewed periodically by the asset liability committee and the board of directors 
this process is intended to ensure the maintenance of sufficient funds to meet the needs of the company  including adequate cash flow for off balance sheet instruments 
our primary sources of liquidity are derived from financing activities which include the acceptance of customer and brokered deposits  federal funds facilities  repurchase agreement facilities  advances from the fhlb of san francisco  and issuance of long term debt 
these funding sources are 
table of contents augmented by payments of principal and interest on loans  the routine liquidation of securities from the available for sale portfolio and securitizations of loans 
in addition  government programs  such as fdic s tlgp  may influence deposit behavior 
primary use of funds include withdrawal of and interest payments on deposits  originations and purchases of loans  purchases of investment securities  and payment of operating expenses 
during the years ended december    and  we experienced net cash inflows from operating activities of million  net cash outflows of million  and cash inflows of  respectively 
in  net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to the large inflow of funds from the proceeds related to the sale of held for sale loans 
proceeds from the sale of held for sale loans totaled million in  an increase of million compared to million in december  at december  and  loss on investments in affordable housing partnerships was included in cash flows from investing activities but was moved to cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated cash flow statement for net cash inflows from investing activities totaled million in  while and experienced net cash inflows of million and cash outflows of million  respectively 
during  net cash inflows were primarily related to the net increases in loans receivables and proceeds from investment pay downs  maturities  calls  and sales of securities available for sale 
however  in  proceeds from investment pay downs  maturities  calls  and sales along with proceeds from the sale of other loans were the largest contributors to the cash provided by investing activities 
largest cash outflows for were attributed to purchases of securities available for sale 
net cash outflows from financing activities totaled million in and million in and cash inflows from financing activities were million for the net cash used by financing activities in was primarily due to decreases in fhlb borrowings and net decrease in deposits 
the primary use of funds in was net decrease in deposits 
in  however  net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the net increase in deposits totaling million 
for purpose of having liquid cash available for emergencies  we maintain a portion of our funds in cash and cash equivalents and loans and securities available for sale 
our liquid assets at december    and totaled approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
our liquidity level measured as the percentage of liquid assets to total assets was   and at december    and  respectively 
the increase in liquid assets in is a result of funds received from the sale of problems loans and proceeds from the capital raise during the second quarter of as a secondary source of liquidity  we have a combination of available borrowing sources comprised of the federal reserve bank s discount window  fhlb advances  federal funds lines with various corresponding banks  and several master repurchase agreements with major brokerage companies 
among all these sources  we prefer advances from the fhlb to supplement our supply of lendable funds and to meet deposit withdrawal requirements 
advances from the fhlb are typically secured by our loans  investments  and stock issued by the fhlb 
advances are made pursuant to several different programs 
each credit program has its own interest rate and range of maturities 
depending on the program  limitations on the amount of advances are based either on a fixed percentage of an institution s net worth or on the fhlb s assessment of the institution s creditworthiness 
while this fund provides flexibility and reasonable cost  we intend to limit our use to of our borrowing capacity as such borrowing does not qualify as core funds 
as of december   our borrowing capacity from the fhlb was approximately million and the outstanding balance was million  or approximately of our borrowing capacity 
as of december   we also maintained a guideline to purchase up to a combined million in federal funds through lines with three correspondent banks 
borrowing capacity at the frb discount window stood at million  with million in securities pledged at december  
table of contents it is management s belief that our liquidity is sufficient to meet the company s short term and long term cash flow needs as they arise 
capital resources and capital adequacy requirements historically  our primary source of capital has been internally generated operating income through retained earnings 
in order to ensure adequate levels of capital  we conduct ongoing assessments of projected sources and uses of capital in conjunction with projected increases in assets and level of risks 
we have considered  and we will continue to consider  additional sources of capital as the need arises  whether through the issuance of additional equity  debt or hybrid securities 
when the us treasury made tarp funds available to financial institutions in october  our board of directors decided to take advantage of this opportunity and increased our capital by participating in the program 
in december  we received a tarp investment from the us treasury in the amount of million 
we are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  we must meet specific capital guidelines that rely on quantitative measures of our assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger regulatory actions under the prompt corrective action rules that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations 
prompt corrective action may include regulatory enforcement actions that restrict dividend payments  require the adoption of remedial measures to increase capital  terminate fdic deposit insurance  and mandate the appointment of a conservator or receiver in severe cases 
in addition  failure to maintain a well capitalized status may adversely affect the evaluation of regulatory applications for specific transactions and activities  including acquisitions  continuation and expansion of existing activities  and commencement of new activities  and could adversely affect our business relationships with our existing and prospective clients 
the aforementioned regulatory consequences for failing to maintain adequate ratios of tier and tier capital could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components  risk weightings  and other factors 
see part i  item description of business regulation and supervision capital adequacy requirements in this annual report on form k for additional information regarding regulatory capital requirements 
as of december   we were qualified as a well capitalized institution under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action

after subtracting fees and costs associated with the capital raise  a total of million in common stock was raised during the second quarter of the increase of million in shareholders equity in consisted primarily of funds from the capital raise partially

at december   total shareholders equity decreased by million  after declaring cash dividends of million million to common shareholders and million to preferred shareholders  to million from million at december  the capital decline was primarily a result of a net loss of million in as of december   we considered the junior subordinated debentures of million  which consists of million issued by the bank and million issued by the company in connection with the issuance of million trust preferred securities for the regulatory capital ratio computation purposes 
at december   as the result of issuance of the series a preferred stock in december  the portion qualified for tier capital increased to million million tarp preferred stock and million trust preferred securities  decreasing the portion for tier capital to million

impact of inflation  seasonality inflation primarily impacts us through its effect on interest rates 
our primary source of income is net interest income  which is affected by changes in interest rates 
we attempt to limit the impact of inflation on our net interest margin through management of rate sensitive assets and liabilities and the analysis of interest rate sensitivity 
the effect of inflation on premises and equipment as well as noninterest expenses has not been significant for the periods covered in this report 
our business is generally not seasonal 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
our market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in lending  investing  and deposit taking activities 
our profitability is affected by fluctuations in interest rates 
a sudden and substantial change in interest rates may adversely impact our earnings to the extent that the interest rates borne by assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent  or on the same basis 
we evaluate market risk pursuant to policies reviewed and approved annually by our board of directors 
the company s board delegates responsibility for market risk management to the asset liability management committee  which reports monthly to the board on activities related to market risk management 
as part of the management of our market risk  the asset liability management committee may direct changes in the mix of assets and liabilities 
to that end  we actively monitor and manage interest rate risk exposures 
interest rate risk management involves development  analysis  implementation  and monitoring of earnings to provide stable income and capital levels during periods of changing interest rates 
in the management of interest rate risk  we utilize gap analysis and simulation modeling to determine the sensitivity of net interest income and economic value of equity 
these techniques are complementary and are used together to provide a more accurate measurement of interest rate risk 
gap analysis measures the repricing mismatches between assets and liabilities 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is determined by subtracting the amount of liabilities from the amount of assets that 
table of contents reprice in a particular time interval 
if repricing assets exceed repricing liabilities in any given time period  we would be deemed to be asset sensitive for that period 
conversely  if repricing liabilities exceed repricing assets in a given time period  we would be deemed to be liability sensitive for that period 
we usually seek to maintain a balanced position over the period of one year to ensure net interest income stability in times of volatile interest rates 
this is accomplished by maintaining a similar level of interest earning assets and interest paying liabilities available to be repriced within one year 
the change in net interest income may not always follow the general expectations of an asset sensitive or a liability sensitive balance sheet during periods of changing interest rates 
this possibility results from interest rates earned or paid changing by differing increments and at different time intervals for each type of interest sensitive asset and liability 
the interest rate gaps arise when assets are funded with liabilities that have different repricing intervals 
because these gaps are actively managed and change daily as adjustments are made in interest rate views and market outlook  positions at the end of any period may not reflect our interest rate sensitivity in subsequent periods 
we attempt to balance longer term economic views against prospects for short term interest rate changes 
although the interest rate sensitivity gap is a useful measurement and contributes to effective asset and liability management  it is difficult to predict the effect of changing interest rates based solely on that measure 
as a result  the asset liability management committee also regularly uses simulation modeling as a tool to measure the sensitivity of earnings and economic value of equity eve to interest rate changes 
the eve is defined as the net present value of an institution s existing assets less liabilities 
the simulation model captures all assets and liabilities  and accounts for significant variables that are believed to be affected by interest rates 
these include prepayment speeds on loans  cash flows of loans and deposits  principal amortization  call options on securities  balance sheet growth assumptions  and changes in rate relationships as various rate indices react differently to market rates 
although the simulation measures the volatility of net interest income and eve under immediate increase or decrease of market interest rate scenarios in basis point increments  our main concern is the negative effect of a reasonably possible worst case scenario 
the asset liability management committee policy prescribes that for the modeled reasonably possible worst rate change scenario  the expected reduction of net interest income and eve should not exceed of the base net interest income and of the base eve  respectively 
in general  based upon our current mix of deposits  loans  and investments  a decrease in interest rates would result in a very small increase in our net interest income but lower our eve 
an increase in interest rates would increase both net interest income and eve 
management believes that the assumptions used to evaluate the vulnerability of our operations to changes in interest rates approximate actual experience and considers them reasonable  however  the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities and the estimated effects of changes in interest rates on our net interest income and eve  could vary substantially if different assumptions are used or actual experience differs from the historical experience on which they are based 
the following table sets forth the interest rate sensitivity of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december  using the interest rate sensitivity gap ratio 
for purposes of the following table  an asset or liability is considered rate sensitive within a specified period when it can be repriced or matures within its contractual terms 
actual payment patterns may differ from contractual payment patterns
