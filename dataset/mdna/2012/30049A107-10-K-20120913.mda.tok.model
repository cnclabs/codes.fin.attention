table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview general we are a petroleum company engaged primarily in the acquisition  exploitation and development of properties for the production of crude oil and natural gas  onshore in the united states 
we acquire known  underdeveloped oil and natural gas resources and exploit them through the application of capital  sound engineering and modern technology to increase production  ultimate recoveries  or both 
we are focused on increasing underlying asset values on a per share basis 
in doing so  we depend on a conservative capital structure  allowing us to maintain control of our assets for the benefit of our shareholders  including approximately beneficially owned by our employees 
our strategy is intended to generate scalable  low unit cost  development and re development opportunities that minimize or eliminate exploration risks 
these opportunities involve the application of modern technology  our own proprietary technology and our specific expertise in overlooked areas of the united states 
the assets we exploit currently fit into three types of project opportunities enhanced oil recovery eor  bypassed primary resources  and unconventional development 
we expect to fund our base fiscal development plan from working capital  with any increases to the base plan funded out of working capital  net cash flows from our properties in the giddings and delhi fields and appropriate financing vehicles  including possible additional issuances of our series a perpetual non convertible preferred stock 
highlights for our fiscal year oil gas reserves pv of proved reserves increased to million from last year s million  despite a decrease in volumes 
the increase in pv a non gaap measure reconciled to the gaap measure below was primarily due to higher average product prices realized during fiscal this was modestly offset by a million boe  or decrease in proved reserve quantities due to million boes of production and million boe in downward revisions net of additions 
positive revisions and additions in delhi and giddings were more than offset by negative revisions in oklahoma and lease expiration of lower valued drilling locations in giddings 
proved developed reserves increased to million boe compared to  or of total proved volumes 
the increase in proved developed reserves is primarily due to the development of million net boe at our delhi field that was previously categorized as puds 
our black oil volumes increased from of proved reserves to in pv of probable reserves increased to million  with a increase in volumes to million boes 
most of the million increase in pv  and virtually all of the million boe increase in probable reserves  was due to assignment of probable reserves to undeveloped leasehold in our mississippi lime project in north central oklahoma 
at yearend  we refocused our development activities on our delhi  ms lime and garp projects going forward 
we believe expansion of these opportunities and others that we may add  combined with monetization or exit from our other projects  will optimize shareholder returns going forward 
proved probable change change reserves mmboe developed liquids pv in millions 
table of contents we believe the presentation of pv provides useful information to investors because it is widely used by analysts and investors in evaluating oil and natural gas companies and the relative monetary significance of their oil and natural gas properties 
pv is not intended to represent the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves  nor should it be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the standardized measure of after tax discounted future net cash flows as defined under gaap 
see estimated oil and natural gas reserves and estimated future net revenues under item properties of this form k for a reconciliation of pv to the standardized measure 
projects delhi field eor northeast louisiana as of june   d m s independent reserve report for our delhi interests continues to reflect a reversionary working interest payout date around late calendar  accompanied by a million bo increase in proved reserves 
based on this reversion date  we continue to expect to bear approximately million of capital expenditures in calendar and million in calendar to complete the development of proved reserves 
currently  all of our delhi production comes from our royalty interest that bears no cost or expense 
at reversion  our net revenue interest will increase from to  and we will begin bearing of all costs 
we expect that the net cash flow from our combined revenue interest after reversion will more than amply cover the projected remaining capital expenditures 
year over year  proved developed reserves at delhi increased from to of delhi proved reserves due to continued investment by the operator and performance in the field 
annual production increased year over year at delhi from net bo per day  gross bo per day to net bo per day  gross bo per day as phase ii was fully reflected in production while phase iii installation was completed in the field 
sequentially  fq daily production sales declined from net bod  gross in fq to net bod  gross 
the production decline at delhi is a direct result of temporarily reduced injections of co due to plant turnaround  drilling activity and equipment limitations that were not related to reservoir issues 
high ambient summer temperatures that were in excess of plant cooling capacity reduced the co injection capacity at the field that drives oil production  thus temporarily deferring a portion of oil production until cooler weather prevails 
looking forward  the operator expects to install additional cooling equipment prior to next summer that should eliminate this issue going forward 
in addition  turnaround maintenance at the processing plant also temporarily impacted field production for a few days during the most recent quarter  and very active drilling operations in the field are believed to have impacted injection and production rates 
currently  phase iv installation is nearing completion 
up to six phases are ultimately expected for current proved reserves  with a seventh phase expected later this decade to add four similar reservoirs 
to date  the operator has reported expending million on the project 
our reversion  however  is based solely on our deemed million reversionary payout amount 
our net production currently is from the royalty interest and is free and clear of all cost  except for a pipeline transportation tariff of approximately per barrel 
our realized oil price at delhi tracks louisiana light sweet oil price  which has been similarly tracking brent crude oil price during as a result  our average realized price for the year at delhi was per barrel 
the impact of higher oil price on our expected reversion date of late calendar was offset by a more conservative slower ramp up of production forecast by our independent reservoir engineer in the june  report 
see estimated oil and natural gas reserves and estimated future net revenues under item properties of this form k for a reconciliation of pv to the standardized measure 
mississippi lime north central oklahoma  kay county as previously announced  we believe the ms lime fits well with our plans to redeploy near term delhi cash flows into one or more new development projects that are oil focused  utilize our horizontal drilling expertise  have substantial room to 
table of contents expand  exhibit reasonable drilling and completion costs and are easily accessible and scalable 
accordingly  in april  we entered the mississippi lime play in north central oklahoma through a joint venture jv to acquire non operating working interests from a private operator based in tulsa  oklahoma 
our position is in kay county where the mississippian lime formation is well defined by previous vertical development and historically has shown higher oil content 
at june   our independent reservoir engineers  pinnacle energy services  llc  assigned probable undeveloped reserves totaling million boe  net to our interest  with a pv of million 
the estimated reserves are black oil and liquids rich natural gas 
our reserves are based on a current  net acres to our interest being of the jv across gross locations on acre spacing  or three locations for each acre section 
on this basis  full development costs are estimated to be million  net to our interest  or per net boe 
we are developing the leasehold initially on acre spacing based on current industry expectations 
with our jv partner  we collectively hold  net acres across mostly contiguous sections averaging approximately of the total gross acres 
we expect to substantially increase our net acreage through forced pooling in these sections 
we may also choose to acquire further bolt on acreage  which would increase our capital requirements and potential reserves 
our jv agreement requires us to drill three firm commitment wells  including one saltwater disposal well and two producer wells 
as of this filing  all commitment wells have been drilled with the two producer wells waiting on hydraulic fracturing currently scheduled for september 
mississippian lime wells typically require initial dewatering before significant oil and gas production is realized  and peak production rates may not be realized until several months after first production 
at this time  we expect to monitor the production from the first two wells for several months before commencing a one drilling rig program 
garp worldwide during  we entered into two commercialization agreements to install garp in two wells in the giddings field 
both tests were completed with excellent results 
in both wells  we were able to significantly increase production and reserves while substantially extending the economic lives and retaining leases 
due to the success in both ventures  we are now in discussions to expand the application of garp to larger groups of wells with the two partners and expect to use the success to enter into additional agreements 
giddings field central texas production declined to net boe per day from net boe in fiscal proved reserves declined million boe  excluding mboe of production 
the slight decline in production was due to normal depletion partially offset by the addition of two commercial garp demonstration wells we brought online with industry partners during fiscal declines in proved reserves were due to expiring leases on three giddings locations that we elected to not renew due to subpar economics driven by natural gas prices  consistent with our de emphasis of giddings 
accordingly  the pv of proved reserves at giddings declined from million in fiscal to million at june  
table of contents we continue to consider monetization of our giddings assets not associated with our garp business 
lopez field south texas we drilled and completed two producing wells and two salt water injection wells during continued issues with inadequate injection rates led us to expend considerable  unexpected levels of operating expense during the year to develop improved injection capacity 
during the third quarter  our efforts resulted in the first drilled producer consistently producing at an oil rate greater than expected on high fluid volumes 
during the quarter ended june   the lopez averaged over bo per day 
the second drilled producer is waiting on new regulatory permits as log results convinced us to convert the drilled injection well with the drilled producer 
our independent reservoir engineer  wd von gonten  assigned mbo of net proved reserves to the lopez well based on limited production history  assigned mbo of proved undeveloped reserves to six drilling locations and mbo of probable reserves to drilling locations 
our interest in and development of the lopez field was based on the ability to prove the concept of redeveloping old oil fields with high water rates and extending that knowledge to similar fields in the region 
operations fiscal net income was million  a million increase over fiscal s million loss 
revenues in fiscal increased to million  compared to million in fiscal the revenue increase was due to a boe increase in sales volumes to mboe  aided by a increase in realized prices averaging per boe 
by far  delhi was the largest contributor due to its sales volume increase on a increase in realized average prices to per bo 
operating costs in fiscal increased to million  while declining on a boe basis to per boe 
the key drivers to the million increase in operating costs were a million increase in lease operating expense due to work on water disposal issues at lopez field  a million increase in depletion expense due to the increase in production volumes  and a million increase in g a  largely due to higher incentive compensation  litigation and public reporting costs associated with becoming an accelerated filer 
non cash  stock based compensation expense of million comprised of general and administrative expense for fiscal non cash  stock based compensation expense remains an important part of our total compensation program  as a small company in competition for talented staff with numerous  more established other companies  to help motivate and retain high performing employees and consultants  in addition to conserving our cash resources 
for further details  see results of operations below 
finances we ended the year with million of working capital  compared to million at june  at june   working capital included million of cash  cash equivalents and short term certificates of deposit 
the million increase in our working capital since june  was due primarily to million of net cash provided from operating activities  before changes in working capital  while the million used in investing activities was virtually funded by the million provided by financing activities 
cash flows from operations covered our general and administrative expenses and all of our capital expenditures 
cash flows from operations were million during the year ended june  in early july  we added million of liquidity through permanent equity via proceeds from sales of our series a preferred stock 
we continue to believe this vehicle may provide us a vehicle for further anti dilutive raises  as  if and when we need it and the markets are open 
we added an unsecured standby credit facility in the amount of million  none of which has been drawn down as of the date of this filing 
we remained debt free 
all of our expenditures were funded solely by working capital and we ended our fiscal year with no funded debt 

table of contents looking forward into we currently expect to be active during fiscal in the mississippi lime and through our garp artificial lift technology  and funding our activity through existing working capital and internally generated cash flows from operations 
we also are considering other projects meeting our strict criteria 
these activities are intended to further our goal of maturing projects outside of delhi and de risking their future capital investment and associated production for near term value creation 
at the same time  we expect production at delhi to continue to increase as phase iii contributes to production and phase iv is put into operation through incremental co injection 

table of contents our base case capital budget of million will be primarily focused on million in the mississippian lime to complete our commitment wells and expand with additional wells million for initial projected garp installations through current commercialization agreements million for certain other projects additional funding of other projects including giddings  subject to non monetization and commodity prices we intend to generate and maintain substantial liquidity to allow us to take advantage of specific success in any one or more of the projects or other opportunities that may arise during the year due to unusual commodity price volatility or market disruption  including the possible repurchase of our common stock 
we remain committed to protecting our substantial value already created in our delhi assets and our conservative  flexible financial approach 
continued conservative financial management 
continue to emphasize long term share value over near term earnings during the current period of low natural gas prices 
retain financial strength and flexibility to assure we obtain proper value of our core assets and protect our joint venture rights in areas of mutual interest 
utilize joint ventures  project financing and or preferred stock issuances to accelerate project development 
we may accelerate our development operations where warranted by utilizing joint ventures  project financing  selective divestments of noncore assets or continued issuance of our preferred stock at an attractive valuation 
improve financial results through increasing production and revenues 
liquidity and capital resources at june   our working capital was million and we continued to be debt free 
this compares to working capital of million at june  the million increase in working capital since june   was due primarily to million of operating cash inflows as investing cash outflows were mostly offset by financing cash inflows reflecting the issuance of preferred stock during the current year 
of the million of capital expenditures incurred during our fiscal year ended june   million was for leasehold acquisitions and million was for development activities 
development activities were primarily in the lopez field in texas and mississippian lime project in oklahoma 
capital expenditures were partially offset by sales of unproved leases in the amount of million

total cash received of million was partially offset by million of cash payments for operating expenses  including lease operating expenses  production taxes  salaries and wages  and payment of million in state income taxes 

table of contents cash flows from investing activities cash paid for oil and gas capital expenditures during the year ended june  was million 
of these expenditures  million was for leasehold acquisitions  principally in the mississippi lime in oklahoma  and million was for development activities 
development expenditures were primarily in the lopez field where four wells were drilled with remaining expenditures made in the mississippi lime and the giddings field in texas 
oil and gas capital expenditures incurred were million for the year ended june  this amount can be reconciled to million of cash capital expenditures on the cash flow statement by adjusting them for non cash transactions  such as accrued capital expenditures presented at note supplemental cash flow information 
at june  the company had advanced  of cash for its share of development costs to be incurred by its joint venture partner in the mississippian lime play and recorded a  advance to be paid subsequent to june  this amount can be reconciled to cash advances to operator on the cash flow statement by adjusting for the related amount accrued as represented in the statement s supplemental information

per boe 
our depletion rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal year was per boe compared to for the rd quarter of  due to the addition of million proved oil reserves at delhi with associated legacy costs of only million transferred to our full cost pool 
the lower fourth quarter rate is the primary cause of the lower annual depletion rate 
inflation 
although the general inflation rate in the united states  as measured by the consumer price index and the producer price index  has been relatively low in recent years  the oil and gas industry has experienced unusually volatile price movements in commodity prices  vendor goods and oilfield services 
prices for drilling and oilfield services  oilfield equipment  tubulars  labor  expertise and other services greatly impact our lease operating expenses and our capital expenditures 
during fiscal  we saw modest increases in drilling and oilfield services costs over prior years 
product prices  operating costs and development costs may not always move in tandem 
known trends and uncertainties 
general worldwide economic conditions continue to be uncertain and volatile 
concerns over uncertain future economic growth are affecting numerous industries  companies  as well as consumers  which impact demand for crude oil and natural gas 
if demand decreases in the future  it may put downward pressure on crude oil and natural gas prices  thereby lowering our revenues and working capital going forward 
in addition  our lease operating expenses and their percentage of our revenues are likely to increase as our working interest production increases at our mississippian lime play  reversion of our back interest at delhi or other additions to our working interest production that would dilute extraordinary margins we have enjoyed from our mineral and overriding royalty interests at delhi 

table of contents seasonality 
our business is generally not directly seasonal  except for instances when weather conditions may adversely affect access to our properties or delivery of our petroleum products 
although we do not generally modify our production for changes in market demand  we do experience seasonality in the product prices we receive  driven by summer cooling and driving  winter heating  and extremes in seasonal weather including hurricanes that may substantially affect oil and natural gas production and imports

we apply the full cost accounting method for our oil and natural gas properties as prescribed by sec regulation s x rule under this method of accounting  the costs of unsuccessful  as well as successful  exploration and development activities are capitalized as properties and equipment 
this includes any internal costs that are directly related to property acquisition  exploration and development activities but does not include any costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of oil and gas properties is not recognized  unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves 
oil and natural gas properties include costs that are excluded from costs being depleted or amortized 
oil and natural gas property costs excluded represent investments in unevaluated properties and include non producing leasehold  geological and geophysical costs associated with leasehold or drilling interests and exploration drilling costs 
we exclude these costs until the property has been evaluated 
costs are transferred to the full cost pool as the properties are evaluated 
as of june   our total unevaluated costs were million  all of which was associated with our mississippi lime leasehold position in north central oklahoma 
if these costs were evaluated and included in our full cost pool  with no increases in our proved reserves as of june   our depreciation  depletion and amortization expense would have increased by approximately  estimates of proved reserves 
the estimated quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves have a significant impact on the underlying financial statements 
the estimated quantities of proved reserves are used to calculate depletion expense  and the estimated future net cash flows associated with those proved reserves is the basis in determining impairment under the quarterly ceiling test calculation 
the process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is very complex  requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of all available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
estimated reserves are often subject to future revisions  which could be substantial  based on the availability of additional information  including reservoir performance  additional development activity  new geological and geophysical data  additional drilling  technological advancements  price changes and other economic factors 
as a result  material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time 
although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that the reported reserve estimates represent the most accurate assessments possible  including the hiring of independent engineers to prepare our reserve estimates  the subjective decisions and variances in available data for the properties make these estimates generally less precise than other estimates included in our financial statements 
material revisions to 
table of contents reserve estimates and or significant changes in commodity prices could substantially affect our estimated future net cash flows of our proved reserves  affecting our quarterly ceiling test calculation and could significantly affect our depletion rate 
a decrease in commodity prices used to determine our proved reserves and standardized measure as of june   would not have resulted in an impairment of our oil and natural gas properties 
holding all other factors constant  a reduction in the company s proved reserve estimate at june  of  and would affect depreciation  depletion and amortization expense by approximately   and  respectively 
on december   the sec issued its final rule on the modernization of reporting oil and gas reserves 
the new rule allows consideration of new technologies in evaluating reserves  allows companies to disclose their probable and possible reserves to investors  requires reporting of oil and gas reserves using an average price based on the previous month unweighted arithmetic average first day of the month price rather than year end prices  revises the disclosure requirements for oil and gas operations  and revises accounting for the limitation on capitalized costs for full cost companies 
the new rule became effective for our annual report on form k for the most recent fiscal year ended june  and did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
valuation of deferred tax assets 
we make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax expense for financial reporting purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing and recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial reporting purposes 
our federal and state income tax returns are generally not prepared or filed before the consolidated financial statements are prepared or filed  therefore  we estimate the tax basis of our assets and liabilities at the end of each period as well as the effects of tax rate changes  tax credits  and net operating loss carry backs and carry forwards 
adjustments related to these estimates are recorded in our tax provision in the period in which we file our income tax returns 
further  we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover or utilize our deferred tax assets primarily our net operating loss 
if recovery is not likely  we must record a valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets for the amount we would not expect to recover  which would result in an increase to our income tax expense 
as of june   we have recorded a valuation allowance for the portion of our net operating loss that is limited by irs section management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making the assessment of the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets 
based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods for which the deferred tax assets are deductible  as of end of the current fiscal year  we believe that it is more likely than not that the company will realize the benefits of its net deferred tax assets 
if our estimates and judgments change regarding our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  our tax provision would increase in the period it is determined that recovery is not probable 
stock based compensation 
we estimate the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
this valuation method requires the input of certain assumptions  including expected stock price volatility  expected term of the award  the expected risk free interest rate  and the expected dividend yield of the company s stock 
the risk free interest rate used is the us treasury yield for bonds matching the expected term of the option on the date of grant 
our dividend yield is zero  as we do not pay a dividend 
because of our limited trading experience of our common stock and limited exercise history of our stock option awards  estimating the volatility and expected term is very subjective 
we base our estimate of our expected future volatility  on peer companies whose common stock has been trading longer than ours  along with our own limited trading history while operating as an oil and natural gas producer 
future estimates of our stock volatility could be substantially different from our current estimate  which could significantly affect the amount of expense we recognize for our stock based compensation awards 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements as of june  
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates 
changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
commodity price risk our most significant market risk is the pricing for crude oil  natural gas and ngls 
we expect energy prices to remain volatile and unpredictable 
if energy prices decline significantly  revenues and cash flow would significantly decline 
in addition  a non cash write down of our oil and gas properties could be required under full cost accounting rules if future oil and gas commodity prices sustained a significant decline 
prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise additional capital  as  if and when needed 
although our current production base may not be sufficient enough to effectively allow hedging  we may use derivative instruments to hedge our commodity price risk
