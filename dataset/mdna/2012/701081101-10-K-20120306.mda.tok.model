item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations other matters liberty project status 
in addition  the construction and commissioning schedule for our two new aadus has experienced numerous delays and cost overruns  and our customer has notified us that our failure to supply operationally ready rigs by december  constituted a default under our drilling contract relating to the rigs 
although we are continuing to work diligently to complete commissioning of the rigs and are in discussions with our customer regarding possible timeframes when the rigs could undergo acceptance testing  we may not be able to reach an agreement regarding a delivery schedule for the rigs 
if we fail to do so  our customer may attempt to terminate our drilling contract 
if such termination occurs and we ultimately are not able to obtain drilling contracts for the aadus  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we rely on a small number of customers and the loss of a significant customer could adversely affect us 
a substantial percentage of our revenues are generated from a relatively small number of customers and the loss of a major customer could adversely affect us 
in  our largest customer  enl accounted for approximately percent of our total revenues 
included in the total revenue from enl is million of reimbursable costs which increase revenues but have little direct impact on gross margins 
our ten most significant customers collectively accounted for approximately percent of our total revenues in our results of operations could be adversely affected if any of our significant customers terminate their contracts with us  fail to renew our existing contracts or refuse to award new contracts to us 
the contract drilling and the rental tools businesses are highly competitive and cyclical  with intense price competition 
the contract drilling and rental tools markets are highly competitive and although we believe no single competitor is dominant  many of our competitors in both the contract drilling and rental tools business may possess greater financial resources than we do 
some of our competitors also are incorporated in countries that may provide them with significant tax advantages that are not available to us as a us company and which may impair our ability to compete with them for many projects 
contract drilling companies compete primarily on a regional basis  and competition may vary significantly from region to region at any particular time 
many drilling and workover rigs can be moved from one region to another in response to changes in levels of activity  provided market conditions warrant  which may result in an oversupply of rigs in an area 
many competitors have constructed numerous rigs during the previous period of high energy prices and  consequently  the number of rigs available in some of the markets in which we operate has exceeded the demand for rigs for extended periods of time  resulting in intense price competition 
most drilling and workover contracts are awarded on the basis of competitive bids  which also results in price competition 
historically  the drilling service industry has been highly cyclical  with periods of high demand  limited rig supply and high dayrates often followed by periods of low demand  excess rig supply and low dayrates 
periods of low demand and excess rig supply intensify the competition in the industry and often result in rigs being idle for long periods of time 
during periods of decreased demand we typically experience significant reductions in dayrates and utilization 
if we experience reductions in dayrates or if we cannot keep our rigs operating  our financial performance will be adversely impacted 
prolonged periods of low utilization and dayrates could result in the recognition of impairment charges on certain of our rigs if future cash flow estimates  based upon information available to management at the time  indicate that the carrying value of these rigs may not be recoverable 

table of contents our international operations are subject to governmental regulation and other risks 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues from our international operations 
in  we derived approximately percent of our revenues from operations in countries outside the united states 
our international operations are subject to the following risks  among others political  social and economic instability  war  terrorism and civil disturbances  limitations on insurance coverage  such as war risk coverage  in certain areas  expropriation  confiscatory taxation and nationalization of our assets  foreign laws and governmental regulation  including inconsistencies and unexpected changes in laws or regulatory requirements  and changes in interpretations or enforcement of existing laws or regulations  increases in governmental royalties  import export quotas or trade barriers  hiring and retaining skilled and experienced workers  many of whom are represented by foreign labor unions  work stoppages  damage to our equipment or violence directed at our employees  including kidnapping  piracy of vessels transporting our people or equipment  unfavorable changes in foreign monetary and tax policies  solicitation by government officials for improper payments or other forms of corruption  foreign currency fluctuations and restrictions on currency repatriation  repudiation  nullification  modification or renegotiation of contracts  and other forms of governmental regulation and economic conditions that are beyond our control 
we currently have operations in countries 
our operations are subject to interruption  suspension and possible expropriation due to terrorism  war  civil disturbances  political and capital instability and similar events  and we have previously suffered loss of revenue and damage to equipment due to political violence 
civil and political disturbances in syria  tunisia  egypt  libya and other north african countries may affect our operations 
we currently have two rigs in algeria 
to the extent that algeria experiences similar events  our operations in algeria could be adversely affected 
we may not be able to obtain insurance policies covering risks associated with these types of events  especially political violence coverage  and such policies may only be available with premiums that are not commercially justifiable 
our international operations are subject to the laws and regulations of a number of foreign countries whose political  regulatory and judicial systems and regimes may differ significantly from those in the united states 
our ability to compete in international contract drilling markets may be adversely affected by foreign governmental regulations and or policies that favor the awarding of contracts to contractors in which nationals of those foreign countries have substantial ownership interests or by regulations requiring foreign contractors to employ citizens of  or purchase supplies from  a particular jurisdiction 
furthermore  our foreign subsidiaries may face governmentally imposed restrictions or fees from time to time on the transfer of funds to us 
in addition  tax and other laws and regulations in some foreign countries are not always interpreted consistently among local  regional and national authorities  which often results in disputes between us and governing authorities 
the ultimate outcome of these disputes is never certain  and it is possible that the outcomes could have an adverse effect on our financial performance 
a portion of the workers we employ in our international operations are members of labor unions or otherwise subject to collective bargaining 
we may not be able to hire and retain a sufficient number of skilled and experienced workers for wages and other benefits that we believe are commercially reasonable 

table of contents we may experience currency exchange losses where revenues are received or expenses are paid in nonconvertible currencies or where we do not take protective measures against exposure to a foreign currency 
we may also incur losses as a result of an inability to collect revenues because of a shortage of convertible currency available to the country of operation  controls over currency exchange or controls over the repatriation of income or capital 
given the international scope of our operations  we are exposed to risks of currency fluctuation and restrictions on currency repatriation 
we attempt to limit the risks of currency fluctuation and restrictions on currency repatriation where possible by obtaining contracts payable in us dollars or freely convertible foreign currency 
in addition  some parties with which we do business could require that all or a portion of our revenues be paid in local currencies 
foreign currency fluctuations  therefore  could have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations and financial condition 
the shipment of goods  services and technology across international borders subjects us to extensive trade laws and regulations 
our import activities are governed by the unique customs laws and regulations in each of the countries where we operate 
moreover  many countries  including the us  control the export and re export of certain goods  services and technology and impose related export recordkeeping and reporting obligations 
governments may also impose economic sanctions against certain countries  persons and other entities that may restrict or prohibit transactions involving such countries  persons and entities 
the laws and regulations concerning import activity  export recordkeeping and reporting  export control and economic sanctions are complex and constantly changing 
these laws and regulations can cause delays in shipments and unscheduled operational downtime 
moreover  any failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory trading obligations could result in criminal and civil penalties and sanctions  such as fines  imprisonment  debarment from governmental contracts  seizure of shipments and loss of import and export privileges 
we are subject to hazards customary for drilling operations  which could adversely affect our financial performance if we are not adequately indemnified or insured 
substantially all of our operations are subject to hazards that are customary for oil and natural gas drilling operations  including blowouts  reservoir damage  loss of well control  cratering  oil and natural gas well fires and explosions  natural disasters  pollution and mechanical failure 
our offshore operations also are subject to hazards inherent in marine operations  such as capsizing  sinking  grounding  collision and damage from severe weather conditions 
any of these risks could result in damage to or destruction of drilling equipment  personal injury and property damage  suspension of operations or environmental damage 
we have had accidents in the past demonstrating some of these hazards 
we may not be able to insure against these risks or to obtain indemnification agreements to adequately protect us against liability from all of the consequences of the hazards and risks described above 
the occurrence of an event not fully insured or for which we are not indemnified against  or the failure of a customer or insurer to meet its indemnification or insurance obligations  could result in substantial losses 
in addition  insurance may not continue to be available to cover any or all of these risks 
for example  pollution  reservoir damage and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable 
even if such insurance is available  insurance premiums or other costs may rise significantly in the future  so as to make the cost of such insurance prohibitive 
for a description of our indemnification obligations and insurance  please read item business insurance and indemnification 
certain areas in and near the gom are subject to hurricanes and other extreme weather conditions 
when operating in the gom  our drilling rigs and rental tools may be located in areas that could cause them to be susceptible to damage or total loss by these storms 
in addition  damage caused by high winds and turbulent seas to our rigs  our shore bases and our corporate infrastructure could potentially cause us to curtail operations for significant periods of time until the effects of the damages can be repaired 
the oil and natural gas industry has sustained several catastrophic losses in recent years  including damage from hurricanes in the gom 
as a result  insurance underwriters have increased insurance premiums and restricted certain insurance coverage such as for losses arising from a named windstorm 
although not a hazard specific to our drilling operations  we could incur significant liability in the event of loss or damage to proprietary data of operators or third parties during our transmission of this valuable data 

table of contents government regulations and environmental risks  which reduce our business opportunities and increase our operating costs  might become more stringent in the future 
government regulations control and often limit access to potential markets and impose extensive requirements concerning employee safety  environmental protection  pollution control and remediation of environmental contamination 
environmental regulations  including species protections  prohibit access to some locations and make others less economical  increase equipment and personnel costs  and often impose liability without regard to negligence or fault 
in addition  governmental regulations  such as those related to climate change  may discourage our customers activities  reducing demand for our products and services 
we may be liable for damages resulting from pollution of offshore waters and  under united states regulations  must establish financial responsibility in order to drill offshore 
see part i  business  environmental considerations 
regulation of greenhouse gases and climate change could have a negative impact on our business 
some scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases  commonly referred to as greenhouse gases ghgs and including carbon dioxide and methane  may be contributing to warming of the earth s atmosphere and other climatic changes 
in response to such studies  the issue of climate change and the effect of ghg emissions  in particular emissions from fossil fuels  is attracting increasing attention worldwide 
legislative and regulatory measures to address concerns that emissions of ghgs are contributing to climate change are in various phases of discussions or implementation at the international  national  regional and state levels 
in  the kyoto protocol to the united nations framework convention on climate change  which establishes a binding set of emission targets for ghgs  became binding on the countries that had ratified it 
international discussions are underway to develop a treaty to replace the kyoto protocol after its expiration in in the united states  federal legislation imposing restrictions on ghgs is under consideration 
in addition  the epa is taking steps that would result in the regulation of ghgs as pollutants under the clean air act the caa 
to date  the epa has issued i a mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases final rule  effective december   which establishes a new comprehensive scheme requiring operators of stationary sources in the united states emitting more than established annual thresholds of carbon dioxide equivalent ghgs to inventory and report their ghg emissions annually  ii an endangerment finding final rule  effective january   which states that current and projected concentrations of six key ghgs in the atmosphere  as well as emissions from new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle engines  threaten public health and welfare  which allowed the epa to finalize motor vehicle ghg standards the effect of which could reduce demand for motor fuels refined from crude oil  and iii a final rule  effective august   to address permitting of ghg emissions from stationary sources under the caa s prevention of significant deterioration psd and title v programs 
this final rule tailors the psd and title v programs to apply to certain stationary sources of ghg emissions in a multi step process  with the largest sources first subject to permitting 
finally  on november   the epa finalized new ghg reporting requirements for upstream petroleum and natural gas systems  which will be added to the epa s ghg reporting rule 
facilities containing petroleum and natural gas systems that emit  metric tons or more of co equivalent per year will now be required to report annual ghg emissions to epa  with the first report due on september  because our business depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry  existing or future laws  regulations  treaties or international agreements related to ghgs and climate change  including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources  could have a negative impact on our business if such laws  regulations  treaties or international agreements reduce the worldwide demand for oil and natural gas or otherwise result in reduced economic activity generally 
in addition  such laws  regulations  treaties or international agreements could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions  which may have a negative impact on our business 
in addition to potential impacts on our business directly or indirectly resulting from climate change legislation or regulations  our business also could be negatively affected by climate change related physical changes or changes in weather patterns 
an increase in severe weather patterns could result in damages to or loss of our rigs  impact our ability to conduct our operations and or result in a disruption of our customers operations 

table of contents we are regularly involved in litigation  some of which may be material 
we are regularly involved in litigation  claims and disputes incidental to our business  which at times involve claims for significant monetary amounts  some of which would not be covered by insurance 
we undertake all reasonable steps to defend ourselves in such lawsuits 
nevertheless  we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of such lawsuits and any resolution which is adverse to us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
see note  commitments and contingencies  in item of this form k for a discussion of the material legal proceedings affecting us 
we are currently conducting an investigation into possible violations of the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and other laws concerning our international operations 
the securities and exchange commission and the department of justice are conducting parallel investigations into possible fcpa violations 
if we are found to have violated the fcpa or other legal requirements  we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures  which could materially harm our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
as previously disclosed  we received requests from the united states department of justice doj in july and the united states securities and exchange commission sec in january relating to our utilization of the services of a customs agent 
the doj and the sec are conducting parallel investigations into possible violations of us law by the company  including the fcpa 
in particular  the doj and the sec are investigating our use of customs agents in certain countries in which we currently operate or formerly operated  including kazakhstan and nigeria 
the company is fully cooperating with the doj and sec investigations and is conducting an internal investigation into potential customs and other issues in kazakhstan and nigeria 
at this point  we are unable to predict the duration  scope or result of the doj or the sec investigation or whether either agency will commence any legal action 
we are currently in continuing discussions with the doj and sec regarding a potential settlement  but no agreement has been reached with either agency 
we cannot predict or estimate whether or when a resolution with each will occur  or the terms  conditions  or other parameters of any such resolution including the size of any monetary penalties or disgorgement 
the doj and the sec have a broad range of civil and criminal sanctions under the fcpa and other laws and regulations  which they may seek to impose against corporations and individuals in appropriate circumstances including  but not limited to  injunctive relief  disgorgement  fines  penalties and modifications to business practices and compliance programs 
these authorities have entered into agreements with  and obtained a range of sanctions against  several public corporations and individuals arising from allegations of improper payments and deficiencies in books and records and internal controls  whereby civil and criminal penalties were imposed 
recent civil and criminal settlements have included multi million dollar fines  deferred prosecution agreements  guilty pleas  and other sanctions  including the requirement that the relevant corporation retain a monitor to oversee its compliance with the fcpa 
in addition  corporations may have to end or modify existing business relationships 
any of these remedial measures  if applicable to us  could have a material adverse impact on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
we are subject to laws and regulations concerning our international operations  including export restrictions  us economic sanctions and other activities that we conduct abroad 
we have conducted an internal review concerning our compliance with these legal requirements and have voluntarily disclosed the results of our review to the us government 
if we are not in compliance with applicable legal requirements  we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties and other remedial measures  which could materially harm our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
we are subject to laws and regulations restricting our international operations  including activities involving restricted countries  organizations  entities and persons that have been identified as unlawful actors or that are subject to us economic sanctions 
pursuant to an internal review  we have identified certain shipments of equipment and supplies that were routed through iran as well as other activities  including drilling activities  which may have violated applicable us laws and regulations 
we have reviewed these shipments  transactions and drilling activities to determine whether the timing  nature and extent of such activities or other conduct may have given rise to violations of these laws and regulations  and we voluntarily disclosed the results of our review 
table of contents to the us government 
at this point  we are unable to predict whether the government will initiate an investigation or any proceedings against us  or the ultimate outcome that may result from our voluntary disclosure 
if us enforcement authorities determine that we were not in compliance with export restrictions  us economic sanctions or other laws and regulations that apply to our international operations  we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties and other remedial measures  which could have an adverse impact on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing could result in reductions or delays in drilling and completing new oil and natural gas wells  which could adversely impact the demand for rental tools 
hydraulic fracturing is a process sometimes used in the completion of oil and gas wells whereby water  sand and chemicals are injected under pressure into subsurface formations to stimulate gas and  to a lesser extent  oil production 
various governmental entities within and outside the united states are in the process of studying  restricting  regulating  or preparing to regulate hydraulic fracturing  directly and indirectly 
for example  several state governments now require the disclosure of chemicals used in the fracturing process 
the us epa has taken the position that some hydraulic fracturing operations are subject to permitting requirements under the safe drinking water act  has proposed new air emissions standards that would apply to well completion activities  is developing new standards for wastewater discharges associated with hydraulic fracturing  and has commenced a study on the impacts of hydraulic fracturing on groundwater 
the bureau of land management is also in the process of developing regulations for hydraulic fracturing activities that would be unique to federal lands 
in addition  some jurisdictions have imposed an express or de facto ban on hydraulic fracturing 
these and other developments could cause operational delays or increased costs in exploration and production  which could adversely affect the demand for our rental tools 
risks related to our common stock the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly 
the market price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate in response to various factors and events  most of which are beyond our control  including the following the other risk factors described in this form k  including changes in oil and natural gas prices  a shortfall in rig utilization  operating revenue or net income from that expected by securities analysts and investors  changes in securities analysts estimates of the financial performance of us or our competitors or the financial performance of companies in the oilfield service industry generally  changes in actual or market expectations with respect to the amounts of exploration and development spending by oil and gas companies  general conditions in the economy and in energy related industries  general conditions in the securities markets  political instability  terrorism or war  and the outcome of pending and future legal proceedings  investigations  tax assessments and other claims 
a hostile takeover of our company would be difficult 
some of the provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and of the delaware general corporation law may make it difficult for a hostile suitor to acquire control of our company and to replace our incumbent management 
for example  our restated certificate of incorporation provides for a staggered board of directors and permits the board of directors  without stockholder approval  to issue additional shares of common stock or a new series of preferred stock 

table of contents risks related to our debt securities we may not be able to repurchase our senior notes upon a change of control 
upon the occurrence of specific change of control events affecting us  the holders of our notes will have the right to require us to repurchase our notes at percent of their principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
our ability to repurchase our notes upon such a change of control event would be limited by our access to funds at the time of the repurchase and the terms of our other debt agreements 
upon a change of control event  we may be required immediately to repay the outstanding principal  any accrued interest on and any other amounts owed by us under our senior secured credit facilities  our notes and other outstanding indebtedness 
the source of funds for these repayments would be our available cash or cash generated from other sources 
however  we may not have sufficient funds available upon a change of control to make any required repurchases of this outstanding indebtedness 
in addition  the change of control provisions in the indenture governing our notes may not protect the holders of our notes from certain important corporate events  such as a leveraged recapitalization which would increase the level of our indebtedness  reorganization  restructuring  merger or other similar transaction  unless such transaction constitutes a change of control under the indenture 
such a transaction may not involve a change in voting power or beneficial ownership or  even if it does  may not involve a change that constitutes a change of control as defined in the indenture that would trigger our obligation to repurchase the notes 
therefore  if an event occurs that does not constitute a change of control as defined in the indenture  we will not be required to make an offer to repurchase the notes and the holders may be required to continue to hold their notes despite the event 
we may not have sufficient cash to repurchase the convertible senior notes at the option of the holder upon a fundamental change or to pay the cash payable upon a conversion or at maturity 
upon the occurrence of a fundamental change as defined in the indenture governing our notes  subject to certain conditions  we will be required to make an offer to repurchase for cash all outstanding notes at percent of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest  including additional amounts  if any  up to but not including the date of repurchase 
in addition  unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation entirely in shares of our common stock  upon a conversion  we will be required to make a cash payment of up to  for each  in principal amount of notes converted 
however  we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of tendered notes or settlement of converted notes 
additionally  any credit facility in place at the time of a repurchase or conversion of the notes may also limit our ability to use borrowings under that credit facility to pay for a repurchase or conversion of the notes and may prohibit us from making any cash payments on the repurchase or conversion of the notes if a default or event of default has occurred under that facility without the consent of the lenders under that credit facility 
our failure to repurchase tendered notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture or to pay any cash payable on a conversion of the notes would constitute a default under the indenture 
a default under the indenture or the fundamental change itself could lead to a default under the other existing and future agreements governing our indebtedness 
if the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods  we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the notes or make cash payments upon conversion thereof 
in addition  the notes will mature in july we may not have sufficient cash or borrowing capacity to repay them in full 
a failure to repay the notes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
see risk we may not be able to repay notes upon maturity 
a failure to repay such notes would cause us to be in default under most of our existing indebtedness above for further discussion 

table of contents the indenture for our senior notes and our senior secured credit agreement impose significant operating and financial restrictions  which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities and taking some actions 
the indenture governing our notes and the agreement governing our senior secured credit facility impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us 
these restrictions limit our ability to make investments and other restricted payments  including dividends  incur additional indebtedness  create liens  engage in sale leaseback transactions  sell our assets or consolidate or merge with or into other companies  and engage in transactions with affiliates 
these limitations are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions 
our senior secured credit agreement also requires us to maintain ratios for consolidated leverage  consolidated interest coverage and consolidated senior secured leverage 
these covenants may adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and to pursue available business opportunities 
a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default with respect to the related indebtedness 
if a default were to occur  the holders of our notes and the lenders under our senior secured credit facility could elect to declare the indebtedness  together with accrued interest  immediately due and payable 
if the repayment of the indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods  we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and outlook overview we produced solid growth in revenues and operating gross margin in our rental tools business continued to respond to the shifting focus of us drilling activity while investing in inventory to meet the growing needs of land and offshore customers 
the us barge drilling business achieved higher fleet average utilization and a higher average dayrate 
our international drilling operations benefited from a higher fleet average dayrate and an additional o m contract that more than offset the impact of a decline in fleet average utilization 
our program to introduce new drilling technology to the alaskan north slope has taken more time and a larger investment than we had anticipated 
the delays and increased costs resulted in a fourth quarter million non cash pretax impairment charge of the two alaskan rigs 
some of our achievements in were we continued to infuse our rental tools business with capital  investing over million in most of this investment went directly for new equipment to serve the increased demand for rental tools created by the growth in us unconventional shale drilling as well as to replace equipment lost in hole or worn out and unserviceable equipment 
we continued to hold the number one position in the us gom barge drilling market  measured by barge drilling rigs working 
according to industry compiled information  over percent of all wells drilled by barge rigs in the shallow waters of the gulf of mexico during were drilled by our rigs 
we successfully completed two significant o m related projects 
one was for the kilometer relocation of the enl owned yastreb rig  returning it to its original drilling site for a new drilling program on sakhalin island  russia 
another was the refurbishment and delivery of the talisman owned heli hoist land rig for service in papua new guinea and being awarded a three year operating contract for that rig 
we continued our involvement in the development of the enl sponsored berkut platform  advancing from providing engineering and design services for the drilling package on this multi purpose platform to providing construction oversight of the drilling package during the platform s shipyard construction phase 
the rental tools segment continued to benefit from the shift in the us land rig count from dry gas to oil and liquids rich fields that also has been accompanied by a shift to longer well bores 
this has increased the need for premium drill pipe and other tubulars 
to meet that growing demand we continued to add to our inventory of tubulars  bops and other products in as demand has continued to grow  we have additional pipe scheduled for delivery in these purchases will allow us to continue to meet the growth in customer needs and maintain service levels 
our us barge drilling business benefited from improvements in dayrates and the rig fleet s average utilization in compared with in the latter part of we had a pause in deep gas drilling after an active summer  with all three of our ultra deep drilling rigs being idle for a time in the fourth quarter 
all three are scheduled to return to work before or during the first quarter of the improvement in our fleet average dayrate contributed to the continued improvement in this segment s profitability 
there has been a notable shift to oil focused drilling in the gom barge market 
this is not unique to us  but an industry wide occurrence  with over two thirds of barge drilling targeted to oil  specifically  or dual oil and gas legs  based on industry information  driven by the current price for the oil and liquids content from these fields 
this is expected to continue to support drilling demand in this market 

table of contents in we made progress on the construction and completion of the aadus in preparation for drilling 
by the end of we were in the process of commissioning the rigs  including making modifications needed to meet the operational and safety objectives we desire 
based on the work requirements we have identified and the progress we have made so far  we expect these rigs to be operationally ready during the international drilling segment s performance was benefitted by the increase in o m activities and higher fleet average dayrate which together more than offset the lower average utilization of the parker owned fleet for as compared to the prior year 
while the overall fleet average utilization declined in both our geographic regions for the year  we had returned to percent utilization in the latin america region and had two previously idle rigs in the eastern hemisphere region contracted to begin work in early we continue to market idle rigs for work in their operational areas and for suitable applications in other markets 
the addition of two significant projects to the international drilling segment s portfolio of o m contracts provided a lift in to the segment s overall performance 
the segment s o m projects included operating the extended reach yastreb land rig and the offshore orlan platform for enl on the sakhalin project 
relocating the yastreb rig on sakhalin island  returning it to its original drilling location for a new drilling program 
operating the coral sea land rig for talisman energy in papua new guinea 
managing a fleet of rigs owned for kuwait drilling company in kuwait 
our technical services segment is primarily engaged in engineering and engineering management services we provide in the development  design  construction and commissioning of innovative drilling solutions for third party customers as well as parker operations 
in  the segment s activities included the engineering and design of the drilling package for the enl owned berkut platform and several early stage engineering and design projects for other e p clients 
the segment s revenue decline in  compared with revenues for  was primarily the result of having completed work on the liberty project in early and the transition to a less revenue intensive phase of the berkut platform project 
much of this work has the potential to evolve into future o m opportunities 
outlook we are encouraged by the state of our operations and our performance potential and expect to see solid results in in line with that potential 
our business outlook remains driven by the growing needs for the services  operational efficiency and safety we deliver to our customers 
during the past several years we invested in our rental tools business people  facilities and equipment to meet the surge in demand for premium drill pipe and to provide premier customer service 
we expect the demand to continue to grow as a result of the shift in the us land drilling market away from dry gas targets to oil and liquids rich targets and the continued increase in footage drilled due to longer lateral wells in the shale plays 
we continue to be proactive in meeting customer needs and expect to add inventory in to meet their requirements 
in addition  the growing fleet of deepwater drilling vessels in the gom is a further source of opportunities for our rental tools business 
we continue to lead in the gom barge drilling market 
drilling remains active in the shallow waters of the gom and is more oil focused today than it has traditionally been 
we expect this shift to oil focused drilling and the continued interest in deep gas plays will provide ongoing support 
we expect our two new technology alaska land rigs  the foundation of our us drilling operations  to be commissioned and presented for work during we have been transforming our international drilling activities  focused both on enhancing the deployment of the assets we have in the field and on leveraging our drilling expertise through o m contracts 
growth in international e p spending  long expected by the industry  should provide opportunities to expand the 
table of contents deployment of our international rig fleet  grow our contract drilling services  and generate business for our technical services segment 
while much of the current work in our technical services segment will continue into  there are several early stage engineering and development opportunities that could expand our activities this year and beyond 
results of operations as of december   the company has modified our reporting segments to be consistent with recent organizational changes to improve our drilling organization 
the company is aligned in six distinct operating segments rental tools us barge drilling us drilling international drilling technical services construction contract we have expanded our segments by one  adding a us drilling segment  represented primarily by our two aadu rigs in alaska 
our us barge drilling segment  previously referred to as the us drilling segment  represents our gom barge business and remains unchanged 
we have aligned our international operations more closely with the management structure we now have in place 
our previous three geographic regions americas  cis ame  and asia pacific are now two latin america and eastern hemisphere 
each region includes all drilling related operations  whether performed using a parker owned rig or a customer owned rig on an o m contract 
our technical services segment  which primarily includes our engagement in engineering support initiatives  pre feed  feed and epc epci projects that have the potential to evolve into future o m opportunities  is now reported as an individual segment with the o m component moving to international drilling as described above 
our rental tools segment remains unchanged 
we have reclassified revenues  expenses and related overhead amounts between the segments as of december  to reflect this alignment 
amounts presented throughout this document for the years ended december  and have been revised to conform to current period presentation 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues of million for the year ended december  increased million  or  from the comparable period

operations rental tools rental tools segment revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to revenues for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to the growth in demand for rental tools  higher utilization of our rental tool inventory and better pricing 
the growing use of lateral drilling and longer well bores to exploit both shale deposits and conventional oil and gas reservoirs continued to lead to greater demand for rental tools 
our investments in rental tool inventory of approximately million expanded our ability to serve this growing demand

risk factors 
international drilling international drilling segment revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december  the higher revenues are primarily due to an increase in revenue generated by our o m contracts offset by a decline in our drilling revenues generated through the operation of rigs that we own 
o m revenues increased to million  or for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in revenues generated through our o m contracts was primarily due to a drilling rig relocation project which began during the fourth quarter of and a shipyard refurbishment and operations project which began during the first quarter of the projects included approximately million of reimbursable costs for the year ended december   which add to revenues but have little direct impact on operating margins 
the increase in o m revenues was partially offset by a lower average dayrate associated with our services on the orlan platform in sakhalin island  russia as the rig was in warm stack mode in compared with workover mode in revenues related to parker owned rigs decreased to million or for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  revenues declined in the eastern hemisphere operations due to reduced average utilization and lower reimbursable revenues  partially offset by a higher average dayrate for our rigs in this region 
the decrease in revenues in the latin america operations is primarily due to reduced average utilization and lower reimbursables partially offset by higher average dayrates for rigs in certain locations in this region 
international drilling operating gross margin  excluding depreciation and amortization  increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the increase in operating gross margin for the year ended december  was due to increased margins for our o m operations in addition to increased margins for our parker owned rig operations 
operating margins generated by our o m operations were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase is primarily due to the yastreb drilling rig move and the coral sea refurbishment program 
our margins related to parker owned rigs were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase is due to the inclusion in of million of expense related to a non cash charge to write off certain value added tax vat assets and expense for property tax assessments and other tax matters 
in addition to the impacts from lower utilization and higher average dayrates in both the eastern hemisphere and latin american regions  we achieved benefits from lower labor costs in our operations in the eastern hemisphere region 
the increase in operating margins was partially offset by a million non cash charge to write off certain vat assets and the recording of expenses related to the estimated salvage cost of a barge rig that was stranded in nigeria 
we have no ongoing operations in nigeria 
technical services technical services segment revenues decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to the transition of the berkut platform project from its engineering phase to a less revenue 
table of contents intensive construction oversight phase and the expiration at the end of the second quarter of of the pre operations phase of the liberty rig contract 
this was partially offset by revenues related to two front end engineering projects that are in the early development stages 
operating gross margin for this segment increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december  the increase in operating gross margin was primarily due to revenues related to two front end engineering projects that are in the early development stages and an increase in operating margin on the liberty project resulting from increased margin for resources contracted to bp to support and maintain the liberty rig 
this was partially offset by a decrease due to the transition in the work content of the berkut platform project 
the technical services segment does not incur depreciation and amortization 
construction contract this segment includes only the liberty extended reach drilling rig construction project for use in the alaskan beaufort sea 
construction contract segment revenues were million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  this segment reported million operating gross margin for the year ended december  resulting from preliminary close out of the liberty project and recognition of final percentage of completion revenues 
the segment reported a million operating gross margin for the year ended december  due to an increase in total estimated construction costs and a longer construction period 
the construction contract segment does not incur depreciation and amortization 
the liberty rig construction contract was a fixed fee and reimbursable contract accounted for on a percentage of completion basis 
as of december  and  we had recognized million and million in project to date revenues  respectively 
we have recognized the entire million fixed fee margin on the contract 
in november  bp informed us that it was suspending construction on the project to review the rig s engineering and design  including its safety systems 
the liberty rig construction contract expired on february  prior to completion of the rig 
before expiration of the construction contract  bp identified several areas of concern relating to design  construction and invoicing for which it asked us to provide explanations and documentation  and we have done so 
although we provided bp with the requested information  we do not know when or how these issues will be resolved with our client 
after expiration of the construction contract  the company and bp continued activities to preserve and maintain the rig under the pre operations phase of an o m contract  which was entered into in august and expired on july  a new consulting services agreement was reached between the company and bp effective july  under the consulting services agreement  we assisted bp in a review of the rig s design  the creation of a new statement of requirements for the rig  and the transition of documentation and materials to bp 
all work under the consulting agreement has been completed and we are engaged with bp on construction contract close out discussions 
other financial data during we recorded a provision for reduction in the carrying value of assets of million related to a final settlement of a customer bankruptcy proceeding

gain on asset dispositions for the year ended december  and was million and million  respectively  and resulted from the sale of equipment deemed to be excess or not currently required for operations 

table of contents interest expense decreased million for the year ended december  compared with the year ended december   due to a million increase in capitalized interest on major projects primarily the two rigs being built in alaska which reduced overall interest expense 
this was partially offset by a million increase in debt related interest expense and million increase in debt amortization costs 
interest income was million for each of the years ended december  and general and administration expense increased million for the year ended december   compared with general and administrative expense for the year ended december  the general and administrative cost increase was due primarily to an increase in legal expenses and salaries and wages  partially offset by a decrease in professional and consulting fees and other corporate administrative expenses 
income tax benefit was million for the year ended december   compared with income tax expense of million for the year ended december  the period tax benefit is driven primarily by the million non cash pretax charge for our aadu rigs in alaska resulting in a million federal and state tax benefit  offset by operating income excluding the impairment  differences in the mix of our domestic and international pretax earnings and losses  as well as the mix of international tax jurisdictions in which we operate

with its facilities strategically located in the major centers of drilling in the us  our rental tools business benefited from servicing this growing demand 
the increased revenues from domestic land markets was somewhat offset by a moderate decline in revenues to gom offshore customers and the international offshore market in compared with the decline in revenues from gom customers is due to the cessation and slow restart of drilling in that market following the macondo well blowout in april the decline in international revenues for this segment was due to fewer placements of rental tools for offshore applications

the start up costs include salaries and employee hiring related expenditures  training and rental of facilities in alaska to support our operations 
international drilling international drilling segment revenues decreased million  or to million for the year ended december  compared with december  the decline was due to a decrease in revenue generated by both parker owned rigs and our o m contracts related to customer owned rigs 
the largest decline related to the rigs that we own occurred in the eastern hemisphere as a result of lower average fleet utilization for our operations throughout this region as spending on drilling programs continued to be adversely impacted by weaker financial conditions and reduced spending on state involved e p programs 
in addition  our caspian sea arctic barge  located in this region  was on reduced dayrates  including a zero dayrate for a period during  as it underwent a planned refurbishment and upgrade project before ending the year on reduced day rates while our customer completed necessary permitting processes 
revenues in our latin america region declined primarily due to lower average fleet utilization and lower average dayrates in mexico and the recognition of a demobilization fee during the second quarter of  which was not repeated in this was offset by increased revenues from our operations in colombia  a result of growing activity in this market that led to higher utilization for our rigs 
revenues related to our o m operations declined due to lower reimburseable expenses related to the operation of the yastreb rig in sakhalin island and the services provided to the customer owned rig fleet in kuwait 
for our sakhalin operations  during we earned a fixed fee during the rig move  upgrade and customer modification phase of the contract  which was not repeated in the decline was offset by higher revenues on our orlan project where we experienced higher dayrates offset by lower reimbursable revenues 
international drilling segment operating gross margin  excluding depreciation and amortization  decreased million  or  to million during the year ended december  compared with the year ended december   with decreases in our eastern hemisphere and latin america regions 
the decline in the eastern hemisphere was primarily attributable to the overall lower revenues as well as increased expenses related to the planned repair  refurbishment  and upgrade project for our caspian sea arctic barge 
the decrease in the latin america region is primarily due to the lower revenues and extended rig move costs and higher labor and fuel costs in colombia 
technical services revenues for this segment increased million  or  during compared with this increase was primarily the result of higher revenues related to the berkut platform project and increased revenues from our bp liberty rig construction contract

the notes were issued at par with interest payable on april and october of each year  beginning october  net proceeds from the notes offering were primarily used to redeem the million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due and to repay million of borrowings under our revolver 
the notes are general unsecured obligations of the company and rank equal in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness 
the notes are jointly and severally guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries other than immaterial subsidiaries and subsidiaries generating revenue primarily outside the united states 
at any time prior to april   we may redeem up to thirty five percent of the aggregate principal amount of notes at a redemption price of percent of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings by us 
on and after april   we may redeem all or a part of the notes upon appropriate notice  at a redemption price of percent of principal amount  and at redemption prices decreasing each year thereafter to par 
if we experience certain changes in control  we must offer to repurchase the notes at percent of the aggregate principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest  if any  to the date of repurchase 
the indenture restricts our ability and the ability of certain subsidiaries to i sell assets  ii pay dividends or make other distributions on capital stock or redeem or repurchase capital stock or subordinated indebtedness  iii make investments  iv incur or guarantee additional indebtedness  v create or incur liens  vi enter into sale and leaseback transactions  vii incur dividend or other payment restrictions affecting subsidiaries  viii merge or consolidate with other entities  ix enter into transactions with affiliates  and x engage in certain business activities 
additionally  the indenture contains certain restrictive covenants designating certain events as events of default 
these covenants are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications 
senior notes  due october at december   we had outstanding million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due notes 
on march   we commenced a cash tender offer tender offer and consent solicitation for all of our outstanding notes  which expired on april  on march   we voluntarily called for redemption of all our notes that were not tendered pursuant to the tender 
table of contents offer  at the redemption price of percent of the principal amount of the notes  or  per  principal amount of the notes 
on april   we redeemed in full the remaining million principal amount of notes 
this redemption resulted in the company recording debt extinguishment costs of million during convertible senior notes  due july on july   we issued million aggregate principal amount of notes due july  as of december   the notes are classified as current debt in our consolidated balance sheet 
the notes were issued at par and interest is payable semiannually on july th and january th 
the significant terms of the notes are as follows notes conversion feature the initial conversion price for holders to convert their notes into shares is at a common stock share price equivalent of shares of common stock per  note value 
conversion rate adjustments occur for any issuances of stock  warrants  rights or options except for stock purchase plans or dividend re investments or any other transfer of benefit to substantially all stockholders  or as a result of a tender or exchange offer 
we may  under advice of our board of directors  increase the conversion rate at our sole discretion for a period of at least days 
notes settlement feature upon tender of the notes for conversion  we can either settle entirely in shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock  solely at our option 
our intent is to satisfy conversion obligation for our notes in cash  rather than in common stock  for at least the aggregate principal amount of the notes 
this reduces the resulting potential earnings dilution to only include any possible conversion premium  which would be the difference between the average price of our shares and the conversion price per share of common stock 
contingent conversion feature holders may only convert notes when either sales price or trading price conditions are met  on or after the notes due date or upon certain accounting changes or certain corporate transactions fundamental changes involving stock distributions 
make whole provisions are only included in the accounting and fundamental change conversions such that holders do not lose value as a result of the changes 
settlement feature upon conversion  we will pay either cash or provide shares of our common stock  if any  based on a daily conversion rate multiplied by a volume weighted average price of our common stock during a specified period following the conversion date 
conversions can be settled in cash or shares  solely at our discretion 
as of december   none of the conditions allowing holders of the notes to convert had been met 
concurrently with the issuance of the notes  we purchased a convertible note hedge note hedge and sold warrants in private transactions with counterparties that were different than the ultimate holders of the notes 
the note hedge included purchasing free standing call options and selling free standing warrants  both exercisable in our common shares 
the note hedge allows us to receive shares of our common stock from the counterparties to the transaction equal to the amount of common stock related to the excess conversion value that we would issue and or pay to the holders of the notes upon conversion 
the terms of the call options mirror the notes major terms whereby the call option strike price is the same as the initial conversion price as are the number of shares callable  per share and  shares  respectively 
this feature prevents dilution of our outstanding shares 
the warrants allow us to sell  common shares at a strike price of per share 
the conversion price of the notes remains at per share  and the existence of the call options and warrants serve to guard against dilution at share prices less than per share  since we would be able to satisfy our obligations and deliver shares upon conversion of the notes with shares that are obtained by exercising the call options 

table of contents we paid a premium of approximately million for the call options  and received proceeds for a premium of approximately million for the sale of the warrants 
this reduced the net cost of the note hedge to million 
the expiration date of the note hedge is the earlier of the last day on which the notes remain outstanding and the maturity date of the notes 
the notes are classified as a liability in our consolidated financial statements 
because we have the choice of settling the call options and the warrants in cash or shares of our common stock and these contracts meet all of the applicable criteria for equity classification  the cost of the call options and proceeds from the sale of the warrants are classified in stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheet 
in addition  because both of these contracts are classified in stockholders equity and are solely indexed to our own common stock  they are not accounted for as derivatives 
debt issuance costs related to the notes totaled approximately million and are being amortized over the five year term of the notes using the effective interest method 
proceeds from the transaction of million were used to redeem our outstanding senior floating rate notes  to pay the net cost of hedge and warrant transactions  and for general corporate purposes 
credit agreement on may   we entered into a credit agreement credit agreement consisting of a senior secured million revolver and senior secured term loan facility term loan of up to million 
the credit agreement provides that subject to certain conditions  including the approval of the administrative agent and the lenders acceptance or additional lenders being joined as new lenders  the amount of the term loan or revolver can be increased by an additional million  so long as after giving effect to such increase  the aggregate commitments shall not be in excess of million 
on april   the company exercised the additional million accordion feature and entered into an amendment to the credit agreement that increased the aggregate commitment under the credit agreement to million and borrowed an additional million in a term loan 
when the facility was increased  all other terms of the credit agreement remained the same  including covenants and applicable rates as defined in the credit agreement 
the credit agreement terminates on may  our obligations under the credit agreement are guaranteed by substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries  each of which have executed guaranty agreements  and are secured by first priority liens on our accounts receivable  specified barge rigs and rental equipment 
the credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants  our most restrictive of which requires we maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of less than to the consolidated leverage ratio is based on the ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit agreement 
ebitda  while not a us gaap measure  reflects a measurement of cash flow and is calculated as income before income taxes plus interest  income taxes  and depreciation and amortization  and other noncash charges 
as of december  we were in compliance with all of our covenants 
we do not anticipate triggering any of these covenants during revolver our revolver  with a contractual capacity of million  is available for general corporate purposes and to support letters of credit 
interest on revolver loans accrues at a base rate plus an applicable rate or libor plus an applicable rate 
the applicable rate varies from a rate per annum ranging from percent to percent for libor rate loans and percent to percent for base rate loans  determined by reference to our consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement 
revolving loans are available subject to a borrowing base calculation based on a percentage of eligible accounts receivable  certain specified barge drilling rigs and rental equipment of the company and its subsidiary guarantors 
there were no revolver borrowings outstanding at december  and million in revolver borrowings outstanding at december  letters of credit outstanding as of december  and december  totaled million and million  respectively 

table of contents term loan the term loan originated at million and required quarterly principal payments of million 
interest on the term loan accrues at either a base rate plus percent or libor plus percent 
on april   the company expanded its term loan facility by million 
funding was provided by certain current lenders and barclays bank plc  which joined as a lender under the credit agreement 
we used the proceeds from the additional term loan to repay million outstanding on the revolver  purchase additional rental tool inventory  and for general corporate purposes 
upon the completion of the transaction  total borrowings under the term loan were million 
payments and amortization on the term loan is million per quarter 
the outstanding balances on the term loan at december  and december  were million and million  respectively

liberty project status in november  bp informed us that it was suspending construction on the project to review the rig s engineering and design  including its safety systems 
we commenced construction of this rig for bp in april pursuant to an epci contract 
in august  bp also awarded us a contract for the first phase of drilling on the liberty field  which is expected to be a two year project to drill an ultra extended reach well  nearly two miles deep and as far as eight miles from the pad 
bp has not announced a schedule for resuming construction on the rig or new target dates for drilling and production start up 
the liberty rig construction contract is a fixed fee and reimbursable contract accounted for on a percentage of completion basis 
costs on the project are reimbursed without markup  except for costs associated with changes in work scope  for which we are entitled to a markup 
as of december   we had recognized million in project to date revenues and the entire million fixed fee margin on the contract 
the liberty rig construction contract expired on february  prior to completion of the rig 
before expiration of the construction contract  bp indentified several areas of concern relating to design  construction and invoicing  for which it asked us to provide explanations and documentation  and we have done so 
although we provided bp with the requested information  we do not know when or how these issues will be resolved with our client 
after expiration of the construction contract  the company and bp continued activities to preserve and maintain the rig under the preoperations phase of our contract  which was entered into in august and expired on july  a new consulting services agreement was reached between the company and bp effective july  under the consulting services agreement  the company assisted bp in a review of the rig s design  the creation of a new statement of requirements for the rig  and the transition of documentation and materials to bp 
all work under the consulting agreement has been completed and we are engaged with bp on construction contract close out discussions 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to fair value of assets  bad debt  materials and supplies obsolescence  property and equipment  goodwill  income taxes  workers compensation and health insurance and contingent liabilities for which settlement is deemed to be probable 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
while we believe that such estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies as they are complex and require significant judgments  assumptions and or estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
other significant accounting policies are summarized in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents fair value measurements for purposes of recording fair value adjustments for certain financial and non financial assets and liabilities  and determining fair value disclosures  we estimate fair value at a price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the principal market for the asset or liability 
our valuation technique requires inputs that we categorize using a three level hierarchy  from highest to lowest level of observable inputs  as follows unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets level  direct or indirect observable inputs  including quoted prices or other market data  for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or identical assets or liabilities in less active markets level and unobservable inputs that require significant judgment for which there is little or no market data level 
when multiple input levels are required for a valuation  we categorize the entire fair value measurement according to the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement even though we may have also utilized significant inputs that are more readily observable 
impairment of property  plant and equipment 
we review the carrying amounts of long lived assets for potential impairment annually  typically during the fourth quarter  or when events occur or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
for example  evaluations are performed when we experience sustained significant declines in utilization and dayrates and we do not contemplate recovery in the near future  or when we reclassify property and equipment to assets held for sale or as discontinued operations as prescribed by accounting guidance related to accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we determine recoverability by evaluating the undiscounted estimated future net cash flows 
when impairment is indicated  we measure the impairment as the amount by which the assets carrying value exceeds its fair value 
management considers a number of factors such as estimated future cash flows  appraisals and current market value analysis in determining fair value 
assets are written down to fair value if the concluded current fair value is below the net carrying value 
asset impairment evaluations are  by nature  highly subjective 
they involve expectations about future cash flows generated by our assets and reflect management s assumptions and judgments regarding future industry conditions and their effect on future utilization levels  dayrates and costs 
the use of different estimates and assumptions could result in materially different carrying values of our assets 
derivative financial instruments we use derivative instruments to manage risks associated with interest rate fluctuations in connection with our credit agreement 
these derivative instruments  which consist of variable to fixed interest rate swaps  are not designated as hedges 
accordingly  the change in the fair value of the interest rate swaps is recognized in earnings 
insurance reserves 
our operations are subject to many hazards inherent to the drilling industry  including blowouts  explosions  fires  loss of well control  loss of hole  damaged or lost drilling equipment and damage or loss from inclement weather or natural disasters 
any of these hazards could result in personal injury or death  damage to or destruction of equipment and facilities  suspension of operations  environmental damage and damage to the property of others 
generally  drilling contracts provide for the division of responsibilities between a drilling company and its customer  and we seek to obtain indemnification from our customers by contract for certain of these risks 
to the extent that we are unable to transfer such risks to customers by contract or indemnification agreements  we seek protection through insurance 
however  these insurance or indemnification agreements may not adequately protect us against liability from all of the consequences of the hazards described above 
moreover  our insurance coverage generally provides that we assume a portion of the risk in the form of an insurance coverage deductible 
based on the risks discussed above  we estimate our liability in excess of insurance coverage and record reserves for these amounts in our consolidated financial statements 
reserves related to insurance are based on the facts and circumstances specific to the insurance claims and our past experience with similar claims 
the actual outcome of insured claims could differ significantly from the amounts estimated 
we accrue actuarially determined amounts in our consolidated balance sheet to cover self insurance retentions for workers compensation  employers liability  general liability  automobile liability and health benefits claims 
these accruals use historical data based upon actual claim settlements and reported claims to project future losses 
these estimates and accruals have historically been reasonable in light of the actual amount of claims paid 
as the determination of our liability for insurance claims could be material and is subject to significant management judgment and in certain instances is based on actuarially estimated and calculated amounts  management believes that accounting estimates related to insurance reserves are critical 

table of contents accounting for income taxes 
we are a us company and we operate through our various foreign branches and subsidiaries in numerous countries throughout the world 
consequently  our tax provision is based upon the tax laws and rates in effect in the countries in which our operations are conducted and income is earned 
the income tax rates imposed and methods of computing taxable income in these jurisdictions vary 
therefore  as a part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate the income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation  amortization and certain accrued liabilities for tax and accounting purposes 
our effective tax rate for financial statement purposes will continue to fluctuate from year to year as our operations are conducted in different taxing jurisdictions 
current income tax expense represents either liabilities expected to be reflected on our income tax returns for the current year  nonresident withholding taxes or changes in prior year tax estimates which may result from tax audit adjustments 
our deferred tax expense or benefit represents the change in the balance of deferred tax assets or liabilities reported on the consolidated balance sheet 
valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in order to determine the amount of deferred tax assets or liabilities  as well as the valuation allowances  we must make estimates and assumptions regarding future taxable income  where rigs will be deployed and other matters 
changes in these estimates and assumptions  as well as changes in tax laws  could require us to adjust the deferred tax assets and liabilities or valuation allowances  including as discussed below 
our ability to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets requires that we achieve certain future earnings levels prior to the expiration of our net operating loss nol and foreign tax credit ftc carryforwards 
in the event that our earnings performance projections do not indicate that we will be able to benefit from our nol and ftc carryforwards  valuation allowances are established 
we periodically evaluate our ability to utilize our nol and ftc carryforwards and  in accordance with accounting guidance related to accounting for income taxes  will record any resulting adjustments that may be required to deferred income tax expense in the period for which an existing estimate changes 
we do not currently provide for us deferred taxes on unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as such earnings are deemed to be permanently reinvested 
if such earnings were to be distributed  we would be subject to us taxes  which may have a material impact on our results of operations 
we periodically review our position and may elect to change our future tax position 
we apply the accounting standards related to uncertainty in income taxes 
this accounting guidance requires that management make estimates and assumptions affecting amounts recorded as liabilities and related disclosures due to the uncertainty as to final resolution of certain tax matters 
because the recognition of liabilities under this interpretation may require periodic adjustments and may not necessarily imply any change in management s assessment of the ultimate outcome of these items  the amount recorded may not accurately reflect actual outcomes 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues and expenses on dayrate contracts as drilling progresses 
revenues from rental activities are recognized ratably over the rental term which is generally less than six months 
mobilization fees received and related mobilization costs incurred are deferred and amortized over the term of the contract period 
construction contract revenues and costs are recognized on a percentage of completion basis utilizing the cost to cost method

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk our international operations expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
there are a variety of techniques to minimize the exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk  including customer contract payment terms and the possible use of foreign currency exchange rate risk derivative instruments 
our primary foreign currency exchange rate risk management strategy involves structuring customer contracts to provide for 
table of contents payment in both us dollars  which is our functional currency  and local currency 
the payment portion denominated in local currency is based on anticipated local currency requirements over the contract term 
due to various factors  including customer acceptance  local banking laws  other statutory requirements  local currency convertibility and the impact of inflation on local costs  actual foreign currency exchange rate risk needs may vary from those anticipated in the customer contracts  resulting in partial exposure to foreign exchange risk 
fluctuations in foreign currencies typically have not had a material impact on our overall results 
in situations where payments of local currency do not equal local currency requirements  foreign currency exchange rate risk derivative instruments  specifically foreign currency exchange rate risk forward contracts  or spot purchases  may be used to mitigate foreign exchange rate currency risk 
a foreign currency exchange rate risk forward contract obligates us to exchange predetermined amounts of specified foreign currencies at specified exchange rates on specified dates or to make an equivalent us dollar payment equal to the value of such exchange 
we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes 
at december   we had no open foreign currency exchange rate risk derivative contracts 
interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates through our fixed rate long term debt 
typically  the fair market value of fixed rate long term debt will increase as prevailing interest rates decrease and will decrease as prevailing interest rates increase 
the fair value of our long term debt is estimated based on quoted market prices where applicable  or based on the present value of expected cash flows relating to the debt discounted at rates currently available to us for long term borrowings with similar terms and maturities 
the estimated fair value of our million principal amount of notes due  based on quoted market prices  was million at december  the estimated fair value of our million principal amount of notes due was million on december  a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates relative to market interest rates at december  would decrease the fair market value of our long term debt at december  by approximately million for the notes and million for the notes 
the company entered into two variable to fixed interest rate swap agreements as a strategy to manage the floating rate risk on the term loan borrowings under the credit agreement 
the two agreements fix the interest rate on a notional amount of million of borrowings at for the period beginning june  and terminating may  the notional amount of the swap agreements will decrease correspondingly with amortization of the term loan 
we will not apply hedge accounting to the agreements and  accordingly  the company will report the mark to market change in the fair value of the interest rate swaps in earnings 
for the year ended december   the company recognized in earnings a million loss on interest rate swaps 
at december   we had no open interest rate risk derivative contracts 
impact of fluctuating commodity prices we are exposed to fluctuations that arise from economic or political risks that have  and will  impact underlying commodity prices for natural gas  oil and gas oil mixtures 
the company s business is subject to price fluctuations in commodities  and may be impacted by prolonged pricing reductions 
currently  the price of natural gas has been depressed due in some part to high levels of natural gas inventory 
drilling for natural gas has been negatively impacted  however  drilling activity and our rental tool business has remained active with the focus on oil liquids rich shale plays
