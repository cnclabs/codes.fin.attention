item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes many forward looking statements 
for cautions about relying on such forward looking statements  please refer to the section entitled forward looking statements at the beginning of this report immediately prior to item general we are a leading company in developing and commercializing high temperature superconductor hts materials and related technologies 
hts materials can substantially improve the performance characteristics of electrical systems  reducing power loss  lowering heat generation  and decreasing electrical noise 
results of operations compared to net revenues consist primarily of commercial product revenues and government contract revenues 
net revenues decreased by million  or  to million in from million in net commercial product revenues decreased by million  or  to million in from million in the decrease is the result of lower sales volume for all of our products 
we sell our superlink and other performance enhancement products to large north american wireless operators 
as our customers continue to invest in g networks  spending on g data networks  where our products are deployed  has become a secondary priority 
this market dynamic has and we believe will continue to impact our commercial revenue 
sales prices for our products were essentially unchanged in from our two largest customers accounted for and of our net commercial revenues in and  respectively 
these customers generally purchase products through non binding commitments with minimal lead times 
consequently  our commercial product revenues can fluctuate dramatically from quarter to quarter based on changes in our customers capital spending patterns 
government contract revenues decreased by million  or  to million in from million in this decrease was principally the result of the completion of a large contract 
this reduced level of government contract revenue has been the planned result of our using more of our limited engineering resources on our commercial projects 
cost of commercial product revenues includes all direct costs  manufacturing overhead and provision for excess and obsolete inventories 
the cost of commercial product revenues totaled million for compared to million for  a decrease of million  or 
the lower costs resulted principally from lower production as a result of lower sales 
our expense provision for obsolete inventories totaled  in compared to  in our cost of sales includes both variable and fixed cost components 
the variable component consists primarily of materials  assembly and test labor  overhead  which includes equipment and facility depreciation  transportation costs and warranty costs 
the fixed component includes test equipment and facility depreciation  purchasing and procurement expenses and quality assurance costs 
given the fixed nature of such costs  the absorption of our production overhead costs into inventory decreases  and the amount of production overhead variances expensed to cost of sales increases  as production volumes decline since we have fewer units to absorb our overhead costs against 
conversely  the absorption of our production overhead costs into inventory increases  and the amount of production overhead variances expensed to cost of sales decreases  as production volumes increase since we have more units to absorb our overhead costs against 
as a result  our gross profit margins generally decrease as revenue and production volumes decline due to lower sales volume and higher amounts of 
table of contents production overhead variances expensed to cost of sales  and our gross profit margins generally increase as our revenue and production volumes increase due to higher sales volume and lower amounts of production overhead variances expensed to cost of sales 
our inventory is valued at the lower of its actual cost or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we review inventory quantities on hand and on order and record  on a quarterly basis  a provision for excess and obsolete inventory and or vendor cancellation charges related to purchase commitments 
if the results of the review determine that a write down is necessary  we recognize a loss in the period in which the loss is identified  whether or not the inventory is retained 
the following is an analysis of our commercial product gross profit margins for and years ended december  dollars in thousands net commercial product sales cost of commercial product sales gross loss we had a negative gross margin of million in from the sale of our commercial products compared to a negative gross margin of million in the negative gross margin in was primarily because the reduced level of commercial sales was insufficient to cover our fixed manufacturing overhead costs 
our gross margins were also adversely impacted by a  charge for excess and obsolete inventory in and a similar charge of  in we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and provide an allowance for excess and obsolete inventory based on numerous factors  including sales backlog  historical inventory usage  forecasted product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months 
cost of government and other contract revenue totaled  in compared to million in  a decrease of million  or 
because these contracts are generally priced on a cost plus basis  declines in revenue generally result in declines in associated costs 
as a percentage of government revenue  government and other contract expenses increased from in to in due to the very low sales level in and the fixed overhead costs required for delivery 
research and development expenses relate to development of new products  including our wireless commercial products 
these expenses also include design expenses associated with reducing the cost and improving the manufacturability of our existing products 
research and development expenses totaled million in compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
in  we decided to use certain of our own technologies and we therefore voluntarily terminated a patent license we had with a third party along with certain other related intangible assets 
as a result  capitalized cost of million was expensed during taking into account the aforementioned expense  research and development expenses decreased for as the result of reduced efforts for improving the manufacturability of our wireless products 
we have relatively fixed engineering resources  and our research and development expenses vary inversely with the amount of those resources allocated to our government contract activities 
selling  general and administrative expenses totaled million in compared to million in  a decrease of million  or 
the lower expenses in resulted primarily from a reduction in employees in the third quarter of other expense in included the subsequent income from the adjustment of the fair value expense of  in from the treatment  as a derivative  of  warrants that were exercisable for common stock 
the warrants expired  unexercised  in august and there was no such income or expense in in and we reduced our work force and incurred severance charges of  and  respectively

the following is an analysis of our commercial product gross profit margins for and years ended december  dollars in thousands net commercial product sales cost of commercial product sales gross profit 
table of contents we had a negative gross margin of million in from the sale of our commercial products compared to a negative gross margin of million in the negative gross margin in was primarily because the reduced level of commercial sales was insufficient to cover our fixed manufacturing overhead costs 
our gross margins were also adversely impacted by a  charge for excess and obsolete inventory in and a similar charge of  in gross margins were favorably impacted by  in by the sale of previously written off inventory 
there was no similar benefit in we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and provide an allowance for excess and obsolete inventory based on numerous factors  including sales backlog  historical inventory usage  forecasted product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months 
cost of government and other contract revenue totaled million in compared to million in  a decrease of million  or 
because these contracts are generally priced on a cost plus basis  declines in revenue generally result in declines in associated costs 
as a percentage of government revenue  government and other contract expenses decreased from in to in because of different cost recognition criteria on one of our cost plus contracts 
research and development expenses totaled million in compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
the increase is the result of new commercial products development effort 
we have relatively fixed engineering resources  and our research and development expenses vary inversely with the amount of those resources allocated to our government contract activities 
selling  general and administrative expenses totaled million in compared to million in  a decrease of million  or 
the lower expenses in resulted primarily from a reduction in employees in the third quarter of other expense in included a loss from our joint venture with baoli in china of  there was no such expense in the adjustment of the fair value expense of  in  and subsequent income in  represents the treatment  as a derivative  of  warrants that were exercisable for common stock

our loss totaled million in compared to million in the net loss available to common stockholders totaled per common share in  compared to per common share in liquidity and capital resources cash flow analysis as of december   we had working capital of million  including million in cash and cash equivalents  compared to working capital of million at december   which included million in cash and cash equivalents 
we currently invest our excess cash in short term  investment grade  money market instruments with maturities of three months or less 
our investments have no exposure to the auction rate securities market 

table of contents cash and cash equivalents increased by million from million at december  to million at december  in  cash was used principally in operations and to a lesser extent for the purchase of property and equipment 
these uses were offset by net cash proceeds of million provided by the sale of common stock 
cash used in operations totaled million in we used million to fund the cash portion of our net loss 
we also used cash to fund a  increases in inventory  prepaid expenses and other assets  and patents and licenses 
these uses were offset by cash generated from lower accounts receivable and higher accounts payable totaling  net cash used in investing activities was million 
purchase of fixed assets totaling million offset by the sale of property and equipment of million 
net cash provided by financing activities in totaled million 
cash from the sale of common stock was million  net of approximately  in expenses  from the registered direct sale of million shares of common stock at per share in february this use was offset by our repurchase of  of our common shares to satisfy tax withholding obligations due from our employees upon the vesting of their restricted stock awards 
financing activities we have historically financed our operations through a combination of cash on hand  equipment lease financings  available borrowings under bank lines of credit and both private and public equity offerings 
as described below in future liquidity  in a registered direct offering completed in february we raised proceeds of million  net of offering costs of  from the sale of  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase up to  shares of common stock 
these securities were sold in multiples of a fixed combination consisting of one share of common stock and a warrant to purchase up to of a share of common stock  at a price of  for an aggregate offering price of million 
each warrant will have an exercise price of per share  for total potential additional proceeds to us of up to million upon exercise of the warrants 
the warrants are exercisable at any time but not prior to the six month anniversary of the issuance of the warrants and have a five year term 
the warrants are exercisable for cash or  solely in the absence of an effective registration statement or prospectus  by cashless exercise 
the exercise price of the warrants is subject to adjustment in the case of stock dividends or other distributions on shares of common stock or any other equity or equity equivalent securities payable in shares of common stock  stock splits  stock combinations  reclassifications or similar events affecting our common stock  and also  subject to limitations  upon any distribution of assets  including cash  stock or other property to our stockholders 
the exercise price of the warrants is not subject to price based anti dilution adjustment 
in a registered direct offering completed in february we raised proceeds of million  net of offering costs of  from the sale of  shares of common stock at per share based on a negotiated discount to market 
we had a line of credit with a bank 
the agreement was structured as a sale of accounts receivable and provided for the sale of up to million of eligible accounts receivable  with advances to us totaling of the receivables sold 
we had not used this line of credit for several years and therefore allowed it to expire without renewal on july  contractual obligations and commercial commitments we incur various contractual obligations and commercial commitments in our normal course of business 
they consist of the following 
table of contents operating lease obligations 
our operating lease obligations consist of facilities leases in santa barbara  california and austin  texas  as well as several smaller equipment leases 
patents and licenses 
we have entered into a licensing agreement requiring royalty payments ranging from to of specified product sales 
the agreement contains a provision for the payment of guaranteed or minimum royalty amounts 
typically  the licensor can terminate our license if we fail to pay minimum annual royalties 
purchase commitments 
in the normal course of business  we incur purchase obligations with vendors and suppliers for the purchase of inventory  as well as other goods and services 
these obligations are generally evidenced by purchase orders that contain the terms and conditions associated with the purchase arrangements 
we are committed to accept delivery of such material pursuant to the purchase orders subject to various contract provisions that allow us to delay receipt of such orders or cancel orders beyond certain agreed upon lead times 
cancellations may result in cancellation costs payable by us 
tabular disclosure of contractual obligations 
at december   we had the following contractual obligations and commercial commitments payments due by period contractual obligations total and and and beyond operating leases minimum license commitment fixed asset and inventory purchase commitments total contractual cash obligations capital expenditures we plan to invest approximately million in fixed assets during future liquidity in  we incurred a net loss of million and had negative cash flows from operations of million 
in  we incurred a net loss of million and had negative cash flows from operations of million 
our independent registered public accounting firms have included in their audit reports for through an explanatory paragraph expressing doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
at december  we had million in cash 
our cash resources may not be sufficient to fund our business for at least the next twelve months 
we believe the key factors to our future liquidity will be our ability to successfully use our expertise and our technology to generate revenues in various ways  including commercial operations  government contracts  joint ventures  licenses and we plan to leverage our leadership in superconducting technologies  extensive intellectual property  and hts manufacturing expertise to develop and produce hts wire 
because of the uncertainty of these factors  we may need to raise funds to meet our working capital needs 
see note in february  we raised proceeds of million  net of offering costs of  from the sale of  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase up to  shares of common stock 
these securities were sold in multiples of a fixed combination consisting of one share of common stock and a warrant to purchase up to of a share of common stock  at a price of  for an aggregate offering price of million 

table of contents each warrant will have an exercise price of per share  for total potential additional proceeds to us of up to million upon exercise of the warrants 
the warrants are exercisable at any time but not prior to the six month anniversary of the issuance of the warrants and have a five year term 
the warrants are exercisable for cash or  solely in the absence of an effective registration statement or prospectus  by cashless exercise 
the exercise price of the warrants is subject to adjustment in the case of stock dividends or other distributions on shares of common stock or any other equity or equity equivalent securities payable in shares of common stock  stock splits  stock combinations  reclassifications or similar events affecting our common stock  and also  subject to limitations  upon any distribution of assets  including cash  stock or other property to our stockholders 
the exercise price of the warrants is not subject to price based anti dilution adjustment 
additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
if we issue additional equity securities to raise funds  the ownership percentage of our existing stockholders would be reduced 
new investors may demand rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of common stock 
if we cannot raise any needed funds  we might be forced to make further substantial reductions in our operating expenses  which could adversely affect our ability to implement our current business plan and ultimately our viability as a company 
net operating loss carryforward as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  which expire in the years through of these amounts  million and million  respectively  resulted from the acquisition of conductus 
under the internal revenue code change of control limitations  a maximum of million and million  respectively  will be available for reduction of taxable income 
in addition  we had research and development and other tax credits for state income tax purposes of approximately  and  respectively  which expire in the years through due to the uncertainty surrounding their realization  we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
accordingly  no deferred tax asset has been recorded in the accompanying balance sheet 
section of the internal revenue code imposes an annual limitation on the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards based on a statutory rate of return usually the applicable federal funds rate  as defined in the internal revenue code and the value of the corporation at the time of a change of ownership as defined by section we had changes in ownership in august  december and june in addition  we acquired the right to conductus net operating losses  which are also subject to the limitations imposed by section conductus underwent four ownership changes  which occurred in february  february  december and june therefore  the ability to utilize conductus and our net operating loss carryforwards of million and million  respectively  which were incurred prior to the ownership changes will be subject in future periods to annual limitations of million and million  respectively 
with respect to years thru  our consolidated net operating loss carryforwards of million will be subject to annual limitation of million 
net operating losses incurred by us subsequent to the ownership changes totaled million and are not subject to this limitation 
an additional million in losses were released from limitation during under section no changes of ownership occurred in for purposes of section market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculation purposes 
our money market investments have no exposure to the auction rate securities market 

table of contents at december   we had approximately million invested in a money market account yielding approximately 
assuming no yield on this money market account and no liquidation of principal for the year  our total interest income would decrease by approximately  per annum 
inflation we do not foresee any material impact on our operations from inflation 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we continually evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  recovery of long lived assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  contract revenue and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
any future changes to these estimates and assumptions could cause a material change to our reported amounts of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
our inventory is valued at the lower of its actual cost or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we review inventory quantities on hand and on order and record  on a quarterly basis  a provision for excess and obsolete inventory and or vendor cancellation charges related to purchase commitments 
if the results of the review determine that a write down is necessary  we recognize a loss in the period in which the loss is identified  whether or not the inventory is retained 
our inventory reserves establish a new cost basis for inventory and are not reversed until we sell or dispose of the related inventory 
such provisions are established based on historical usage  adjusted for known changes in demands for such products  or the estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements 
our business is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product development and rapid product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
demand for our products can fluctuate significantly 
our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  and we may understate or overstate the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
our net sales consist of revenue from sales of products  net of trade discounts and allowances 
we recognize revenue when evidence of an arrangement exists  contractual obligations have been satisfied  title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
at the time revenue is recognized  we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties if allowed for under contractual arrangements and return products 
our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should such failure rates or costs differ from these estimates  accrued warranty costs would be adjusted 

table of contents we indemnify  without limit or term  our customers against all claims  suits  demands  damages  liabilities  expenses  judgments  settlements and penalties arising from actual or alleged infringement or misappropriation of any intellectual property relating to our products or other claims arising from our products 
we cannot reasonably develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of payments that might be made under our indemnities because of the uncertainty as to whether a claim might arise and how much it might total 
contract revenues are principally generated under research and development contracts 
contract revenues are recognized utilizing the percentage of completion method measured by the relationship of costs incurred to total estimated contract costs 
if the current contract estimate were to indicate a loss  utilizing the funded amount of the contract  a provision would be made for the total anticipated loss 
contract revenues are derived primarily from research contracts with agencies of the united states government 
credit risk related to accounts receivable arising from such contracts is considered minimal 
these contracts include cost plus  fixed price and cost sharing arrangements and are generally short term in nature 
all payments to us for work performed on contracts with agencies of the us government are subject to adjustment upon audit by the defense contract audit agency 
based on historical experience and review of current projects in process  we believe that the audits will not have a significant effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the defense contract audit agency has audited us through we periodically evaluate the realizability of long lived assets as events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to recover the carrying amount 
long lived assets that will no longer be used in our business are written off in the period identified since they will no longer generate any positive cash flows for us 
such evaluation is based on various analyses  including cash flow and profitability projections 
the analyses necessarily involve significant management judgment 
in the event the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than net book value of the assets  the carrying value of the assets will be written down to their estimated fair value 
our future cash flows may vary from estimates 
stock based employee compensation cost is recognized using the fair value based method for all awards granted on or after the beginning of we issue stock option awards and restricted share awards to employees and to non employee directors under our stock based incentive plans 
the fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
compensation cost related to restricted share awards is recorded based on the market price of our common stock on the grant date 
we recognize compensation expense over the expected vesting period on a straight line basis from the grant date 
our valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets is based on our assessments of historical losses and projected operating results in future periods 
if and when we generate future taxable income in the us against which these tax assets may be applied  some portion or all of the valuation allowance would be reversed and an increase in net income would consequently be reported in future years
