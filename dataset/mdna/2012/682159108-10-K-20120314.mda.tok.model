results of operations the following table summarizes selected statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of revenues year ended december  revenues cost of services gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses impairment of goodwill operating income interest expense interest income income loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss columns may not foot due to rounding 
results of operations for the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  revenues year ended december  change revenues by segment in thousands life sciences healthcare physician it and engineering total revenues increased million  or percent  mainly due to growth in all four segments which was partially due to our acquisitions of cambridge  sharpstream  valesta and hcp 
cambridge and sharpstream were acquired in  valesta was acquired during the first quarter of and hcp was acquired on july  cambridge is reported under the life sciences  it and engineering and physician segments  sharpstream and valesta are reported under the life sciences segment and hcp is reported under the physician segment 
consolidated revenues for the year ended december  included million related to our cambridge  sharpstream  valesta and hcp acquisitions compared with million related to the cambridge and sharpstream acquisitions in life sciences segment revenues increased million  or percent  comprised of a million increase in staffing revenues and a million  or percent increase in direct hire and conversion fees 
the increase in staffing revenues resulted from a percent increase in the average number of contract professionals on assignment and a percent increase in average bill rate 
the year over year increase in revenues was primarily attributable to increased demand for our service offerings as our clients end markets have improved in with the progressing economic recovery and an increase in revenues of million from the business acquired in and revenues for our healthcare segment comprised of our nurse travel and allied healthcare lines of business increased million  or percent 
the increase in revenues in the healthcare segment was attributable to improved economic trends in the healthcare sector  which contributed to the increase in the number of contract professionals on assignment  open orders and average bill rates and supporting customers who were undergoing system conversions 
although the healthcare segment remains soft  we continue to see signs of improvement in demand 
nurse travel revenues increased million  or percent  to million  comprised of a percent increase in the average number of nurses on assignment and a percent increase in the average bill rate 
revenues related to staffing resulting from labor disruptions at customer sites included million in and million in allied healthcare revenues increased million  or percent  to million  comprised of a percent increase in average number of contract professionals on assignment and a percent increase in the average bill rate

the legacy physician staffing business decreased year over year 
we attribute this to continued uncertainty related to healthcare reform  fewer physicians deciding to retire  current economic conditions and high unemployment which have reduced the number of elective procedures and lowered patient census at client facilities 
it and engineering segment revenues increased million  or percent  comprised of a percent increase in the average number of contract professionals on assignment and a percent increase in average bill rate 
the increase in revenue was also due to a million  or percent increase in direct hire and conversion fee revenues 
it and engineering segment revenues for the year ended december  included million in revenue from our cambridge acquisition in april  compared with million in because many of our placements involve capital projects  we believe that one of the reasons the demand for our services has increased with the progressing economic recovery is that more companies have increased their capital spending

interest payments related to our bank debt are not set forth in the table above 
we are partially self insured for our workers compensation liability related to the life sciences  healthcare and it and engineering segments as well as the medical malpractice liability related to the physician segment 
in connection with this program  we pay a base premium plus actual losses incurred up to certain levels and are insured for losses greater than certain levels per occurrence and in the aggregate 
the self insurance claim liability is determined based on claims filed and claims incurred but not yet reported 
we account for claims incurred but not yet reported based on estimates derived from historical claims experience and current trends of industry data 
changes in estimates  differences in estimates and actual payments for claims are recognized in the period that the estimates changed or payments were made 
the self insurance claim liability was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
additionally  we have unused stand by letters of credit outstanding to secure obligations for workers compensation claims with various insurance carriers 
the unused stand by letters of credit at december  and were million and million  respectively 
as of december  and  we have an income tax reserve in other long term liabilities related to our uncertain tax positions of million 
we are involved in various other legal proceedings  claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
however  based on the facts currently available  we do not believe that the disposition of matters that are pending or asserted will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
we are subject to earn out obligations entered into in connection with acquisitions 
if the acquired businesses meet predetermined targets  we are obligated to make additional cash payments in accordance with the terms of such earn out obligations
