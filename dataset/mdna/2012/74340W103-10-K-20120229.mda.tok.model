item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and our segment footnote note to our consolidated financial statements in item for more information with regard to the investments and results of operations of our segments 
competition the existence of competitively priced distribution space available in any market could have a material impact on our ability to rent space and on the rents that we can charge 
to the extent we wish to acquire land for future development of properties in our real estate operations segment or dispose of land  we may compete with local  regional  and national developers 
we also face competition from investment managers for institutional capital 
we believe we have competitive advantages due to i our ability to respond quickly to customers needs for high quality distribution space in key global distribution markets  ii our established relationships with key customers served by our local personnel  iii our ability to leverage our organizational structure to provide a single point of contact for our global customers through our global customer solutions team  iv our property management and leasing expertise  v our relationships and proven track record with current and prospective investors in our private capital business  vi our global experience in the development and management of industrial properties  vii the strategic locations of our land that we expect to develop  and viii our personnel who are experienced in the land entitlement process 
customers we have developed a customer base that is diverse in terms of industry concentration and represents a broad spectrum of international  national  regional and local distribution space users 
at december   in our real estate operations segment  we had  customers occupying million square feet of distribution space 
in the unconsolidated properties we manage  we had  customers occupying million square feet of distribution space 
in our real estate operations segment  our largest customer and largest customers accounted for and  respectively  of our annualized base rent at december  within our global customer solutions team  we develop long term relationships with our customers and understand their business and needs  serving as their strategic partner for real estate on a global basis 
keeping in close contact with customers and focusing on exceptional customer service sets us apart from other real estate providers as much more than a landlord 
we believe that what we offer in terms of scope  scale and quality of assets is unique 
our in depth knowledge of our markets helps us stay ahead of trends and create forward thinking solutions for their distribution networks 
this depth of customer knowledge results in greater retention and expanded service  which garners additional business from the same customer across multiple geographies 
approximately of our annual base rent is derived from customers who lease from us in more than one location and more than one country 
in our private capital segment  we consider our private capital investors to be our customers 
as of december   we partnered with investors  several of which invest in multiple funds 
employees we employ  persons in our entire organization 
our employees work in four countries in the americas persons  in countries in europe persons and in three countries in asia persons 
of the total  we have assigned employees to our real estate operations segment and employees to our private capital segment 
we have employees who work in corporate and support positions who are not assigned to a segment who may assist with segment activities 
we believe our relationships with our employees are good 
our employees are not organized under collective bargaining agreements  although some of our employees in europe are represented by statutory works councils and benefit from applicable labor agreements 
management s overview at the time of the merger  we established key strategic priorities to guide our path over the next two years 
these priorities are to align our portfolio with our investment strategy while serving the needs of our customers  
table of contents to strengthen our financial position and build one of the top balance sheets in the reit industry  to streamline our private capital business and position it for substantial growth  to improve the utilization of our low yielding assets  and to build the most effective and efficient organization in the reit industry and to become the employer of choice among top professionals interested in real estate as a career 
align our portfolio with our investment strategy subsequent to the merger  we performed a comprehensive review of our owned and managed portfolio  and categorized the portfolio into three main segments global  regional and other markets 
global markets represent approximately of our overall owned and managed platform based on our share of net operating income of the properties 
regional markets represent of our total owned and managed platform 
we intend to hold only the highest quality class a product in our regional markets 
we also own a small number of assets in other markets  which account for of our owned and managed platform and that we plan to exit from in an orderly fashion in the next few years 
by segmenting our markets in this manner  we were able to construct a strategy that includes culling the portfolio for buildings and potentially submarkets that are no longer a strategic fit for the company 
we expect to use the proceeds from dispositions to pay down debt and to recycle capital into new development projects or strategic acquisitions 
strengthen our financial position we intend to further strengthen our financial position by lowering our financial risk and currency exposure and building one of the strongest balance sheets in the reit industry 
we expect to lower our financial risk by reducing leverage and maintaining staggered debt maturities  which will provide us with more financial flexibility and allow continued access to debt capital markets 
this financial flexibility will position us to capitalize on market opportunities across the entire business cycle as they become available 
we expect to lower our currency exposure by owning assets outside the us primarily in co investment ventures in which we maintain an ownership interest and provide services generating private capital revenue 
we will accomplish this through contributions and sales to our existing and newly formed co investment ventures 
in addition  we expect that new development projects  particularly in emerging markets such as brazil  china and mexico  will be done in conjunction with our private capital partners 
we will also reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations by borrowing in local currencies when appropriate 
streamline private capital business we are rationalizing our private capital business in conjunction with our private capital investors 
some of our co investment ventures have fee structures that do not adequately compensate us for the services we provide 
therefore  we may terminate or restructure certain of these co investment ventures 
in other cases  we may combine some co investment ventures to gain operational efficiencies 
in every case  however  we will work very closely with our partners and venture investors who will be active participants in these decisions 
we plan to grow our private capital business with the deployment of the private capital commitments we have already raised  formation of new co investment ventures and raising incremental capital for our existing co investment ventures 
improve the utilization of our low yielding assets we plan to increase the value of our low yielding assets by stabilizing our operating portfolio to its historical average of leased  completing the build out and lease up of our development projects as well as monetizing our land through development or sale to third parties 
build the most effective and efficient organization in the reit industry and become the employer of choice among top professionals interested in real estate as a career we have identified more than million of merger cost synergies on an annualized basis  as compared to the combined expenses of amb and prologis on a pre merger basis 
these synergies include gross general and administrative savings  reduced global line of credit facility fees and lower amortization of non real estate assets 
we believe we have realized approximately of these synergies already and expect to realize the full amount by year end in addition  we are in the process of implementing a new enterprise wide system that will include a property management billing system  a human resources system  a general ledger and accounting system and a data warehouse 
in connection with this implementation  we are striving to utilize the most effective global business processes with the enhanced system functionality 
we have implemented two new compensation plans that we believe will better align employees compensation to our performance 
we believe these efforts and others will help us with the attainment of this objective 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of our results and progress attaining the objectives outlined above 
code of ethics and business conduct we maintain a code of ethics and business conduct applicable to our board and all of our officers and employees  including the principal co executive officers  the principal financial officer and the principal accounting officer  or persons performing similar functions 
a copy of our code of ethics and business conduct is available on our website  www 
prologis 
com 
in addition to being accessible through our website  copies of our code of ethics and business conduct can be obtained  free of charge  upon written request to investor relations  pier  bay  san francisco  california any amendments to or waivers of our code of ethics and business conduct that apply to the principal 
table of contents executive officers  the principal financial officer  or the principal accounting officer  or persons performing similar functions  and that relate to any matter enumerated in item b of regulation s k  will be disclosed on our website 
environmental matters we are exposed to various environmental risks that may result in unanticipated losses and affect our operating results and financial condition 
either the previous owners or we subjected a majority of the properties we have acquired  including land  to environmental reviews 
while some of these assessments have led to further investigation and sampling  none of the environmental assessments has revealed an environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in item and item a 
risk factors 
insurance coverage we carry insurance coverage on our properties 
we determine the type of coverage and the policy specifications and limits based on what we deem to be the risks associated with our ownership of properties and our business operations in specific markets 
such coverages include property damage and rental loss insurance resulting from such perils as fire  additional perils as covered under an extended coverage policy  named windstorm  flood  earthquake and terrorism  commercial general liability insurance  and environmental insurance 
insurance is maintained through a combination of commercial insurance  self insurance and through a wholly owned captive insurance entity 
we believe that our insurance coverage contains policy specifications and insured limits that are customary for similar properties  business activities and markets and we believe our properties are adequately insured 
however  an uninsured loss could result in loss of capital investment and anticipated revenues and earnings 
see further discussion in item a 
risk factors 
item a 
risk factors our operations and structure involve various risks that could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  distributable cash flow and value of our securities 
these risks include  among others general disruptions in the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
global market and economic conditions have been challenging with tighter credit conditions and slower growth in most major economies during the last few years 
although signs of recovery may exist  there are continued concerns about the systemic impact of inflation  the availability and cost of credit  a lagging real estate market and geopolitical issues that contribute to increased market volatility and uncertain expectations for the global economy 
to the extent there is turmoil in the financial markets  it has the potential to materially affect the value of our properties and investments in our unconsolidated investees  the availability or the terms of financing that we and our unconsolidated investees have or may anticipate utilizing  our ability and that of our unconsolidated investees to make principal and interest payments on  or refinance any outstanding debt when due and may impact the ability of our customers to enter into new leasing transactions or satisfy rental payments under existing leases 
the market volatility over the last several years has made the valuation of our properties and those of our unconsolidated investees more difficult 
there may be significant uncertainty in the valuation  or in the stability of the value  of our properties and those of our unconsolidated investees  that could result in a decrease in the value of our properties and those of our unconsolidated investees 
as a result  we may not be able to recover the current carrying amount of our investments in real estate properties  including our unconsolidated investees  which may require us to recognize an impairment charge in earnings in addition to the charges we previously recognized 
any additional  continued or recurring disruptions in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and ability to make distributions and payments to our security holders and the market price of our securities 
as a global company  we are subject to social  political and economic risks of doing business in many countries 
we conduct a significant portion of our business and employ a substantial number of people outside of the united states 
during  we generated approximately or million of our revenue from operations outside the united states 
circumstances and developments related to international operations that could negatively affect our business  financial condition or results of operations include  but are not limited to  the following factors difficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations in certain regions  differing employment practices and labor issues  local businesses and cultural factors that differ from our usual standards and practices  volatility in currencies  currency restrictions  which may prevent the transfer of capital and profits to the united states  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and other laws  potentially adverse tax consequences  
table of contents the responsibility of complying with multiple and potentially conflicting laws  eg  with respect to corrupt practices  employment and licensing  the impact of regional or country specific business cycles and economic instability  political instability  uncertainty over property rights  civil unrest  drug trafficking  political activism or the continuation or escalation of terrorist or gang activities particularly with respect to our operations in mexico  foreign ownership restrictions with respect to operations in countries  and access to capital may be more restricted  or unavailable on favorable terms or at all in certain locations 
our global growth including growth in new regions in the united states also subjects us to certain risks  including risks associated with funding increasing headcount  integrating new offices  and establishing effective controls and procedures to regulate the operations of new offices and to monitor compliance with regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act  the uk bribery act and similar laws 
although we have committed substantial resources to expand our global platform  if we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with our global business or to adequately manage operational fluctuations  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 
in addition  our international operations and  specifically  the ability of our non us subsidiaries to dividend or otherwise transfer cash among our subsidiaries  including transfers of cash to pay interest and principal on our debt  may be affected by currency exchange control regulations  transfer pricing regulations and potentially adverse tax consequences  among other things 
the depreciation in the value of the foreign currency in countries where we have a significant investment may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 
we have pursued  and intend to continue to pursue  growth opportunities in international markets where the us dollar is not the functional currency 
at december   approximately or billion of our total assets are invested in a currency other than the us dollar  primarily the euro  japanese yen and british pound sterling 
as a result  we are subject to foreign currency risk due to potential fluctuations in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar 
a significant change in the value of the foreign currency of one or more countries where we have a significant investment may have a material adverse effect on our financial position  debt covenant ratios and results of operations 
although we attempt to mitigate adverse effects by borrowing under debt agreements denominated in foreign currencies and  on occasion and when deemed appropriate  using derivative contracts  there can be no assurance that those attempts to mitigate foreign currency risk will be successful 
real estate investments are not as liquid as certain other types of assets  which may reduce economic returns to investors 
real estate investments are not as liquid as certain other types of investments and this lack of liquidity may limit our ability to react promptly to changes in economic or other conditions 
in addition  significant expenditures associated with real estate investments  such as secured mortgage payments  real estate taxes and maintenance costs  are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investments 
like other companies qualifying as reits under the internal revenue code  we are only able to hold property for sale in the ordinary course of business through taxable reit subsidiaries in order to not incur punitive taxation on any tax gain from the sale of such property 
while we may dispose of certain properties that have been held for investment in order to generate liquidity  if we do not satisfy certain safe harbors or we believe there is too much risk of incurring the punitive tax on any tax gain from the sale  we may not pursue such sales 
in the event that we do not have sufficient cash available to us through our operations or available credit facilities to continue operating our business as usual  we may need to find alternative ways to increase our liquidity 
such alternatives may include  without limitation  divesting ourselves of properties  whether or not they otherwise meet our strategic objectives to keep in the long term  at less than optimal terms  incurring debt  entering into leases with our customers at lower rental rates or less than optimal terms or entering into lease renewals with our existing customers without an increase in rental rates at turnover 
there can be no assurance  however  that such alternative ways to increase our liquidity will be available to us 
additionally  taking such measures to increase our liquidity may adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow  our ability to make distributions and payments to our security holders and the market price of our securities 
risks related to our business general economic conditions and other events or occurrences that affect areas in which our properties are geographically concentrated  may impact financial results 
we are exposed to general economic conditions  local  regional  national and international economic conditions and other events and occurrences that affect the markets in which we own properties 
our operating performance is further impacted by the economic conditions of the specific markets in which we have concentrations of properties 
as of december   approximately of our consolidated operating properties or billion based on investment before depreciation are located in california  which represented of the aggregate square footage of our operating properties and of our annualized base rent 
our revenue from  and the value of  our properties located in california may be affected by local real estate conditions such as an oversupply of or reduced demand for industrial properties and the local economic climate 
business layoffs  downsizing  industry 
table of contents slowdowns  changing demographics and other factors may adversely impact california s economic climate 
because of the number of properties we have located in california  a downturn in california s economy or real estate conditions could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and ability to make distributions and payments to our security holders and the market price of our securities 
in addition to california  we also have significant holdings defined as more than of total investment before depreciation in operating properties in certain global and regional markets located in chicago  dallas fort worth  france  japan  new jersey new york city  south florida and the united kingdom 
our operating performance could be adversely affected if conditions become less favorable in any of the markets in which we have a concentration of properties 
conditions such as an oversupply of distribution space or a reduction in demand for distribution space  among other factors  may impact operating conditions 
any material oversupply of distribution space or material reduction in demand for distribution space could adversely affect our results of operations  distributable cash flow and the value of our securities 
in addition  our unconsolidated investees have concentrations of properties in the same markets mentioned above  as well as in markets in central and eastern pennsylvania  germany  mexico  poland and reno and are subject to the economic conditions in those markets 
a number of our properties are located in areas that are known to be subject to earthquake activity 
us properties located in active seismic areas include properties in the san francisco bay area  los angeles  and seattle 
international properties located in active seismic areas include japan and mexico 
we generally carry earthquake insurance on our properties located in areas historically subject to seismic activity  subject to coverage limitations and deductibles if we believe it is commercially reasonable 
we evaluate our earthquake insurance coverage annually in light of current industry practice through an analysis prepared by outside consultants and in some specific instances have elected to self insure our earthquake exposure based on this analysis 
we have elected not to carry earthquake insurance for wholly owned assets in japan based on this analysis 
further  a number of our properties are located in areas that are known to be subject to hurricane and or flood risk 
we carry hurricane and flood hazard insurance on all of our properties located in areas historically subject to such activity  subject to coverage limitations and deductibles if we believe it is commercially reasonable 
we evaluate our insurance coverage annually in light of current industry practice through an analysis prepared by outside consultants 
our insurance coverage does not include all potential losses 
we and our unconsolidated investees currently carry insurance coverage including property damage and rental loss insurance resulting from certain perils such as fire and additional perils as covered under an extended coverage policy  namely windstorm  flood  earthquake and terrorism  commercial general liability insurance  and environmental insurance  as appropriate for the markets where each of our properties and business operations are located 
the insurance coverage contains policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties  business activities and markets 
we believe our properties and the properties of our unconsolidated investees are adequately insured 
however  there are certain losses  including losses from floods  earthquakes  acts of war  acts of terrorism or riots  that are not generally insured against or that are not generally fully insured against because it is not deemed economically feasible or prudent to do so 
if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs with respect to one or more of our properties  we could experience a significant loss of capital invested and future revenues in these properties and could potentially remain obligated under any recourse debt associated with the property 
furthermore  we cannot be sure that our insurance companies will be able to continue to offer products with sufficient coverage at commercially reasonable rates 
if we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds insured limits with respect to one or more of our properties or if our insurance companies fail to meet their coverage commitments to us in the event of an insured loss  then we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties  as well as the anticipated future revenue from those properties and  if there is recourse debt  then we would remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the properties 
any such losses or higher insurance costs could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and ability to make distributions and payments to our security holders and the market price of our securities 
investments in real estate properties are subject to risks that could adversely affect our business 
investments in real estate properties are subject to varying degrees of risk 
while we seek to minimize these risks through geographic diversification of our portfolio  market research and our property management capabilities  these risks cannot be eliminated 
some of the factors that may affect real estate values include local conditions  such as an oversupply of distribution space or a reduction in demand for distribution space in an area  the attractiveness of our properties to potential customers  competition from other available properties  increasing costs of rehabilitating  repositioning  renovating and making improvements to our properties  our ability to provide adequate maintenance of  and insurance on  our properties  our ability to control rents and variable operating costs  
table of contents governmental regulations  including zoning  usage and tax laws and changes in these laws  and potential liability under  and changes in  environmental  zoning and other laws 
our investments are concentrated in the industrial distribution sector and our business would be adversely affected by an economic downturn in that sector 
our investments in real estate assets are primarily concentrated in the industrial distribution sector 
this concentration may expose us to the risk of economic downturns in this sector to a greater extent than if our business activities were more diversified 
our operating results and distributable cash flow will depend on the continued generation of lease revenues from customers and we may be unable to lease vacant space or renew leases or re lease space on favorable terms as leases expire 
our operating results and distributable cash flow would be adversely affected if a significant number of our customers were unable to meet their lease obligations 
we are also subject to the risk that  upon the expiration of leases for space located in our properties  leases may not be renewed by existing customers  the space may not be re leased to new customers or the terms of renewal or re leasing including the cost of required renovations or concessions to customers may be less favorable to us than current lease terms 
our competitors may offer space at rental rates below current market rates or below the rental rates we currently charge our customers  we may lose potential customers  and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge in order to retain customers when our customers leases expire 
in the event of default by a significant number of customers  we may experience delays and incur substantial costs in enforcing our rights as landlord  and may be unable to re lease spaces 
a customer may experience a downturn in its business  which may cause the loss of the customer or may weaken its financial condition  resulting in the customer s failure to make rental payments when due or requiring a restructuring that might reduce cash flow from the lease 
in addition  a customer may seek the protection of bankruptcy  insolvency or similar laws  which could result in the rejection and termination of such customer s lease and thereby cause a reduction in our available cash flow 
if we decide to contribute or sell properties to an unconsolidated investee or third parties to generate proceeds  we may not be successful 
we may contribute or sell properties to certain of our unconsolidated investees or third parties on a case by case basis 
our ability to sell properties on advantageous terms is affected by competition from other owners of properties that are trying to dispose of their properties  market conditions  including the capitalization rates applicable to our properties  and other factors beyond our control 
if our competitors sell assets similar to assets we intend to divest in the same markets and or at valuations below our valuations for comparable assets  we may be unable to divest our assets at favorable pricing or on favorable terms or at all 
the unconsolidated investee or third parties who might acquire our properties may need to have access to debt and equity capital  in the private and public markets  in order to acquire properties from us 
should they have limited or no access to capital on favorable terms  then dispositions could be delayed 
if we are unable to generate proceeds through property sales we may have to delay our deleveraging plans  which may result in adverse effects on our liquidity  distributable cash flow  debt covenant ratios  and the value of our securities 
we may acquire properties  which involves risks that could adversely affect our operating results and the value of our securities 
we may acquire industrial properties 
the acquisition of properties involves risks  including the risk that the acquired property will not perform as anticipated and that any actual costs for rehabilitation  repositioning  renovation and improvements identified in the pre acquisition due diligence process will exceed estimates 
when we acquire properties  we may face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge or understanding of the local economy  forging new business relationships in the area and unfamiliarity with local government and permitting procedures 
additionally  there is  and it is expected there will continue to be  significant competition for properties that meet our investment criteria as well as risks associated with obtaining financing for acquisition activities 
our real estate development strategies may not be successful 
our real estate development strategy is focused on monetizing land in the future through sales to third parties  development of industrial properties to hold for long term investment or contribution or sale to an unconsolidated investee  depending on market conditions  our liquidity needs and other factors 
we may expand investment in our development  renovation and redevelopment business and we will complete the build out and leasing of our development platform 
we may also develop  renovate and redevelop properties within existing or newly formed development co investment ventures 
the real estate development  renovation and redevelopment business involves significant risks that could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and ability to make distributions and payments to our security holders and the market price of our securities  which include the following risks we may not be able to obtain financing for development projects on favorable terms or at all and complete construction on schedule or within budget  resulting in increased debt service and construction costs and delays in leasing the properties and generating cash flow  we may not be able to obtain  or may experience delays in obtaining  all necessary zoning  land use  building  occupancy and other governmental permits and authorizations  we may seek to sell certain land parcels and not be able to find a third party to acquire such land or the sales price will not allow us to recover our investment  resulting in additional impairment charges  
table of contents development opportunities that we explore may be abandoned and the related investment impaired  the properties may perform below anticipated levels  producing cash flow below budgeted amounts  we may not be able to lease properties on favorable terms or at all  construction costs  total investment amounts and our share of remaining funding may exceed our estimates and projects may not be completed  delivered or stabilized as planned  we may not be able to attract third party investment in new development co investment ventures or sufficient customer demand for our product  we may not be able to capture the anticipated enhanced value created by our redevelopment projects on expected timetables or at all  we may experience delays temporary or permanent if there is public opposition to our activities  and substantial renovation  new development and redevelopment activities  regardless of their ultimate success  typically require a significant amount of management s time and attention  diverting their attention from our day to day operations 
we are exposed to various environmental risks that may result in unanticipated losses that could affect our operating results and financial condition 
under various federal  state and local laws  ordinances and regulations  a current or previous owner  developer or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances 
the costs of removal or remediation of such substances could be substantial 
such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the release or presence of such hazardous substances 
in addition  third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages based on personal injury  property damage or other costs  including investigation and clean up costs  resulting from the environmental contamination 
environmental laws in some countries  including the united states  also require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos  adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and undertake special precautions  including removal or other abatement  in the event that asbestos is disturbed during building renovation or demolition 
these laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos 
some of our properties are known to contain asbestos containing building materials 
in addition  some of our properties are leased or have been leased  in part  to owners and operators of businesses that use  store or otherwise handle petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances  creating a potential for the release of such hazardous or toxic substances 
further  certain of our properties are on  adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances  or upon which others have engaged  are engaged or may engage in activities that may release such hazardous or toxic substances 
from time to time  we may acquire properties  or interests in properties  with known adverse environmental conditions where we believe that the environmental liabilities associated with these conditions are quantifiable and that the acquisition will yield a superior risk adjusted return 
in connection with certain divested properties  we have agreed to remain responsible for  and to bear the cost of  remediating or monitoring certain environmental conditions on the properties 
we cannot give any assurance that other such conditions do not exist or may not arise in the future 
the presence of such substances on our real estate properties could adversely affect our ability to lease  develop or sell such properties or to borrow using such properties as collateral and may have an adverse effect on our distributable cash flow 
we are subject to risks and liabilities in connection with forming co investment ventures  investing in new or existing co investment ventures  attracting third party investment and investing in and managing properties through co investment ventures 
as of december   we have an investment in approximately million square feet held through unconsolidated investees 
our organizational documents do not limit the amount of available funds that we may invest in unconsolidated investees  and we may and currently intend to develop and acquire properties through co investment ventures and investments in other entities when warranted by the circumstances 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to form new co investment ventures  attract third party investment or make additional investments in new or existing co investment ventures  successfully develop or acquire properties through unconsolidated entities  or realize value from such unconsolidated entities 
our inability to do so may have an adverse effect on our growth  our earnings and the market price of our securities 
our partners in our unconsolidated investments may share certain approval rights over major decisions and some partners may manage the properties in the unconsolidated investees 
our unconsolidated investments involve certain risks  including if our partners fail to fund their share of any required capital contributions  then we may choose to contribute such capital  
table of contents our partners might have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals that would affect our ability to operate the property  the venture or other governing agreements often restrict the transfer of an interest in the co investment venture or may otherwise restrict our ability to sell the interest when we desire or on advantageous terms  our relationships with our partners are generally contractual in nature and may be terminated or dissolved under the terms of the agreements  and in such event  we may not continue to manage or invest in the assets underlying such relationships resulting in reduced fee revenue or causing a need to purchase such interest to continue ownership  and disputes between us and our partners may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers and directors from focusing their time and effort on our business and result in subjecting the properties owned by the applicable co investment venture to additional risk 
we generally seek to maintain sufficient influence over our unconsolidated investees to permit us to achieve our business objectives  however  we may not be able to do so  and the occurrence of one or more of the events described above could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and ability to make distributions and payments to our security holders and the market price of our securities 
contingent or unknown liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition 
we have acquired and may in the future acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse  or with only limited recourse  with respect to unknown liabilities 
as a result  if a liability were asserted against us based upon ownership of any of these entities or properties  then we might have to pay substantial sums to settle it  which could adversely affect our cash flow 
contingent or unknown liabilities with respect to entities or properties acquired might include liabilities for environmental conditions  losses in excess of our insured coverage  accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business  tax  legal and regulatory liabilities  and claims for indemnification by the general partners  officers and directors and others indemnified by the former owners of our properties 
risks related to financing and capital we face risks associated with the use of debt to fund our business activities  including refinancing and interest rate risks  and our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected if we are unable to make required payments on our debt or are unable to refinance our debt 
we are subject to risks normally associated with debt financing  including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any maturing indebtedness  that such refinancing would be on terms as favorable as the terms of the maturing indebtedness  or that we will be able to otherwise obtain funds by selling assets or raising equity to make required payments on maturing indebtedness 
if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or meet our payment obligations  the amount of our distributable cash flow and our financial condition would be adversely affected and  if the maturing debt is secured  the lender may foreclose on the property securing such indebtedness 
our global senior credit agreement  yen based credit agreement and certain other debt bears interest at variable rates 
increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense under these agreements 
in addition  our unconsolidated investees may be unable to refinance indebtedness or meet payment obligations  which may impact our distributable cash flow and our financial condition and or we may be required to recognize impairment charges of our investments 
covenants in our credit agreements could limit our flexibility and breaches of these covenants could adversely affect our financial condition 
the terms of our various credit agreements  including our global senior credit agreement and yen based credit agreement  the indentures under which our senior notes are issued and other note agreements  require us to comply with a number of customary financial covenants  such as maintaining debt service coverage  leverage ratios  fixed charge ratios and other operating covenants including maintaining insurance coverage 
these covenants may limit our flexibility in our operations  and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness 
if we default under the covenant provisions and are unable to cure the default  refinance the indebtedness or meet payment obligations  the amount of our distributable cash flow and our financial condition could be adversely affected 
adverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively affect our financing activity 
the credit ratings of our senior unsecured notes and preferred stock are based on our operating performance  liquidity and leverage ratios  overall financial position and other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analyses of us 
our credit ratings can affect 
table of contents the amount of capital we can access  as well as the terms and pricing of any debt we may incur 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings  and in the event our credit ratings are downgraded  we would likely incur higher borrowing costs and may encounter difficulty in obtaining additional financing 
also  a downgrade in our credit ratings may trigger additional payments or other negative consequences under our current and future credit facilities and debt instruments 
adverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively impact our refinancing and other capital market activities  our ability to manage debt maturities  our future growth  our financial condition  the market price of our securities  and our development and acquisition activity 
we are dependent on external sources of capital 
in order to qualify as a reit  we are required each year to distribute to our stockholders at least of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding any net capital gain and we may be subject to tax to the extent our income is not fully distributed 
while historically we have satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our stockholders  we may choose to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or other property  including  in limited circumstances  our own stock 
for distributions with respect to taxable years ending on or before december   and in some cases declared as late as december   the reit can satisfy up to of the distribution requirements discussed above through the distribution of shares of our stock if certain conditions are met 
assuming we continue to satisfy these distribution requirements with cash  we may not be able to fund all future capital needs  including acquisition and development activities  from cash retained from operations and may have to rely on third party sources of capital 
further  in order to maintain our reit status and not have to pay federal income and excise taxes  we may need to borrow funds on a short term basis to meet the reit distribution requirements even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings 
these short term borrowing needs could result from differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for federal income tax purposes  or the effect of non deductible capital expenditures  the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments 
our ability to access debt and equity capital on favorable terms or at all is dependent upon a number of factors  including general market conditions  the market s perception of our growth potential  our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions and the market price of our securities 
federal income tax risks our failure to qualify as a reit would have serious adverse consequences 
the reit elected to be taxed as a reit under sections through of the internal revenue code  commencing with the taxable year ended december  we believe we have operated so as to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code and believe that the current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the internal revenue code to enable us to continue to qualify as a reit 
however  it is possible that we are organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow us to qualify as a reit  or that our future operations could cause us to fail to qualify 
qualification as a reit requires us to satisfy numerous requirements some on an annual and others on a quarterly basis established under highly technical and complex sections of the internal revenue code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations  and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 
for example  in order to qualify as a reit  the reit must derive at least of its gross income in any year from qualifying sources 
in addition  we must pay dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least of the reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding capital gains and must satisfy specified asset tests on a quarterly basis 
the provisions of the internal revenue code and applicable treasury regulations regarding qualification as a reit are more complicated in our case because we hold assets through the operating partnership 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we will be required to pay federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on taxable income at regular corporate rates 
unless we are entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions  we would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which we lost the qualification 
if we lost our reit status  our net earnings would be significantly reduced for each of the years involved 
furthermore  we own a direct or indirect interest in certain subsidiary reits which elected to be taxed as reits under sections through of the internal revenue code 
provided that each subsidiary reit qualifies as a reit  our interest in such subsidiary reit will be treated as a qualifying real estate asset for purposes of the reit asset tests  and any dividend income or gains derived by us from such subsidiary reit will generally be treated as income that qualifies for purposes of the reit gross income tests 
to qualify as a reit  the subsidiary reit must independently satisfy all of the reit qualification requirements 
if such subsidiary reit were to fail to qualify as a reit  and certain relief provisions did not apply  it would be treated as a regular taxable corporation and its income would be subject to united states federal income tax 
in addition  a failure of the subsidiary reit to qualify as a reit would have an adverse effect on our ability to comply with the reit income and asset tests  and thus our ability to qualify as a reit 
certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income  resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction 
from time to time  we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties  including by contributing properties to our co investment ventures 
under the internal revenue code  any gain resulting from transfers of properties we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business is treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a penalty tax 
we do not believe that our transfers or disposals of property or our contributions of properties into our co investment ventures are prohibited transactions 
however  whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction 
the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or dispositions of properties by us or contributions of properties into our co investment ventures are prohibited transactions 
while we believe that the internal revenue service 
table of contents would not prevail in any such dispute  if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer  disposition  or contribution of property constituted a prohibited transaction  we would be required to pay a penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction 
in addition  income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit 
legislative or regulatory action could adversely affect us 
in recent years  numerous legislative  judicial and administrative changes have been made to the federal income tax taws applicable to investments in reits and similar entities 
additional changes to tax laws are likely to continue to occur in the future  and may impact our taxation or that of our stockholders 
risks relating to the merger the combined company may be unable to integrate its businesses successfully and realize the anticipated synergies and related benefits of the merger or do so within the anticipated timeframe 
on june   amb and prologis completed the merger 
the merger involved a combination of two companies that previously operated as independent public companies  each of which operated its own private capital platform focused on the industrial real estate sector and served as the sponsor or manager of  or in a similar capacity with respect to  numerous private equity investment vehicles 
the combined company is required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of the constituent companies 
potential difficulties the combined company may encounter in the integration process include the following the inability to successfully combine the businesses in a manner that permits the combined company to achieve the cost savings anticipated to result from the merger  the complexities associated with managing the combined businesses out of several different locations and integrating personnel and systems from the two companies  the additional complexities of combining two companies with different histories  cultures  regulatory restrictions  markets and customer bases  the failure to retain key employees of either of the two companies  and performance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of management s attention caused by completing the merger 
for all these reasons  it is possible that the integration process could result in the distraction of our management  the disruption of our ongoing business or the diversion of our resources to the integration process as we attempt to complete the integration process  any of which could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and ability to make distributions and payments to security holders and the market price of our securities 
other risks risks associated with our dependence on key personnel 
we depend on the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees 
from time to time  our personnel and their roles may change 
in connection with the completion of the merger  there were changes to our personnel and their roles 
while we believe that we have retained our key talent and can find suitable employees to meet our personnel needs  the loss of key personnel  any change in their roles  or the limitation of their availability could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and ability to make distributions and payments to security holders and the market price of our securities 
if we are unable to continue to attract and retain our executive officers  or if compensation costs required to attract and retain key employees become more expensive  our performance and competitive position could be materially adversely affected 
compliance or failure to comply with the americans with disabilities act and other similar regulations could result in substantial costs 
under the americans with disabilities act  places of public accommodation must meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons 
noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants 
if we are required to make unanticipated expenditures to comply with the americans with disabilities act  including removing access barriers  then our cash flow and the amounts available to make distributions and payments to our security holders may be adversely affected 
our properties are also subject to various federal  state and local regulatory requirements  such as state and local fire and life safety requirements 
we could incur fines or private damage awards if we fail to comply with these requirements 
while we believe that our properties are currently in material compliance with these regulatory requirements  the requirements may change or new requirements may be imposed that could require significant unanticipated expenditures by us that will affect our cash flow and results of operations 
we are subject to governmental regulations and actions that affect operating results and financial condition 
many laws  including tax laws  and governmental regulations apply to us  our unconsolidated investees and our properties 
changes in these laws and governmental regulations  or their interpretation by agencies or the courts  could occur  which might affect our ability to conduct business 

table of contents our business could be adversely impacted if we have deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting 
the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors  misstatements or misrepresentations 
while management will continue to review the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting  there can be no guarantee that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time 
deficiencies  including any material weakness  in our internal control over financial reporting which may occur in the future could result in misstatements of our results of operations  restatements of our financial statements  a decline in the price of our securities  or otherwise materially adversely affect our business  reputation  results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
we are exposed to the potential impacts of future climate change and climate change related risks 
we consider that we are exposed to potential physical risks from possible future changes in climate 
our distribution facilities may be exposed to rare catastrophic weather events  such as severe storms and or floods 
if the frequency of extreme weather events increases due to climate change  our exposure to these events could increase 
we do not currently consider ourselves to be exposed to regulatory risks related to climate change  as our operations do not emit a significant amount of greenhouse gases 
however  we may be adversely impacted as a real estate developer in the future by potential impacts to the supply chain and or stricter energy efficiency standards for buildings

item properties we are invested in real estate properties that are primarily generic industrial properties 
in japan  our industrial properties are generally multi level centers  which is common in japan due to the high cost and limited availability of land 
our properties are typically used for distribution  storage  packaging  assembly and light manufacturing of consumer and industrial products 
based on the square footage of the operating properties included in our real estate operations segment at december  and discussed below  our properties are industrial properties  including used for bulk distribution  used for light manufacturing and assembly  used for flex industrial  used for on tarmac and used for other purposes 
geographic distribution our investment strategy focuses on providing distribution and logistics space to customers whose businesses are tied to global trade and depend on the efficient movement of goods through the global supply chain 
our properties are primarily located in two main market types  global markets and regional markets 
global markets account for of our consolidated operating properties based on investment balance and comprise approximately of the largest and most liquid markets tied to global trade 
these markets feature large population centers with high per capita consumption rates and close proximity to airports  seaports and ground transportation systems 
regional markets account for of our consolidated operating properties 
similar to global markets  regional markets benefit from large population centers but typically are not as tied to the global supply chain and are often less supply constrained

table of contents item legal proceedings from time to time  we and our unconsolidated investees are parties to a variety of legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business 
we believe that  with respect to any such matters that we are currently a party to  the ultimate disposition of any such matter will not result in a material adverse effect on our business  financial position or results of operations 
in december  arbitration hearings began in connection with a dispute related to a real estate development project known as pacific commons 
the plaintiff  cisco technology  inc cisco  is seeking rescission of a restructuring and settlement agreement the contract and other agreements  and declaratory relief  and damages for breach of the contract 
specifically  cisco seeks declaratory relief that prologis owes certain community facilities district taxes that have been assessed against cisco s land  following cisco s purchase of the land from prologis through the exercise of option agreements  declaratory relief that prologis partial transfers of rights and obligations under the contract to third parties are void  and damages for alleged breaches of the contract relating to the plans to build a baseball stadium at pacific commons 
although the total damages alleged by cisco are approximately million  we believe these claims are without merit and are defending these matters vigorously 
based on the facts and circumstances surrounding this dispute  we believe the low end of our range of loss is zero and therefore  in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  we have not recorded any liability with respect to this matter as of december  item mine safety disclosures not applicable part ii item market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities market information and holders our common stock is listed on the nyse under the symbol pld

risk factors 
the company we are the leading global owner  operator and developer of industrial real estate  focused on markets tied to global trade across the americas  europe and asia 
as of december   we owned  or had investments in  on a consolidated basis or through unconsolidated ventures  properties and development projects totaling approximately million square feet million square meters in countries 
these properties are leased to approximately  customers  including third party logistics providers  manufacturers  retailers  transportation companies and other enterprises 
of the approximately million square feet of our owned and managed portfolio as of december  approximately million square feet were operating industrial distribution buildings with a gross book value of billion that were occupied  approximately million square feet in our development portfolio with a total expected investment of billion that were leased  
table of contents approximately million square feet consist of properties we manage on behalf of third parties  properties in which we have an ownership interest but do not manage and non industrial properties we own  and the largest customer and largest customers accounted for and  respectively  of the annualized base rent of the combined portfolio 
prologis  inc is a self administered and self managed real estate investment trust  and is the sole general partner of prologis  lp we operate the reit and the operating partnership as one enterprise  and  therefore  our discussion and analysis refers to the reit and its consolidated subsidiaries  including the operating partnership  collectively 
on june   we completed the merger in which prologis shareholders received of a share of amb common stock for each outstanding common share of beneficial interest in prologis 
following the merger  amb changed its name to prologis  inc in the merger  amb was the legal acquirer and prologis was the accounting acquirer 
therefore  pre merger activity included in the management discussion and analysis is the activity of prologis and does not include amb results until june  in may  we also acquired a controlling interest in and began consolidating pepr 
we have recorded the purchase price allocations for both the merger of billion and pepr acquisition of billion in our december  consolidated balance sheet 
our results for reflect approximately seven months of the impact of the merger and the pepr acquisition 
therefore  period to period comparisons may not provide as meaningful of information as if those transactions were reflected in both periods 
as a result of this merger  we have identified more than million on an annualized basis of merger cost synergies  as compared to the combined expenses of amb and prologis on a pre merger basis 
these synergies include gross general and administrative savings  reduced global line of credit facility fees and lower amortization of non real estate assets 
we believe we have realized approximately of these synergies already and expect to realize the full amount by year end see note to the consolidated financial statements in item for more information relating to both the merger and pepr acquisition 
business strategy our current business strategy includes two operating segments real estate operations and private capital 
we generate revenues  earnings  net operating income  and funds from operations  both as defined below  and cash flows through our segments primarily through three lines of business  as follows real estate operations segment rental operations this represents the primary source of our core revenue  earnings and funds from operations or ffo as defined below 
we collect rent from our customers under operating leases  including reimbursements for the vast majority of our operating costs 
we seek to generate long term internal growth in rents by maintaining a high occupancy rate at our properties  by controlling expenses and through contractual rent increases on existing space and renewals on rollover space  thus capitalizing on the economies of scale inherent in owning  operating and growing a large global portfolio 
our rental income is diversified due to both our global presence and our broad customer base 
we expect to increase overall rental income primarily through the leasing of space currently available in our properties 
we believe that our regular maintenance programs  capital expenditure programs  energy management and sustainability programs create cost efficiencies that provide a benefit to our customers as well as the company 
capital deployment activities our development and re development activities support our rental operations and are  therefore  included with that line of business for segment reporting 
we develop and re develop industrial properties primarily in global and regional markets to meet our customers needs 
within this line of business  we provide additional value creation by utilizing i the land that we currently own in global and regional markets  ii the development expertise of our local personnel  iii our global customer relationships  and iv the demand for high quality distribution facilities in key markets 
we seek to increase our rental income and the net asset value of the company through the leasing of newly developed space  as well as through the acquisition of new properties 
depending on several factors  we may develop properties directly or in co investment ventures for long term hold  for contribution into one of our co investment ventures  or for sale to third parties 
properties that we choose to contribute or sell may result in the recognition of gains or losses 
generally  in the us  europe and japan  we are developing directly while in emerging markets  such as brazil  china and mexico  we are developing with our private capital partners in a variety of co investment ventures 
private capital segment we co invest in properties with private capital investors through a variety of co investment ventures 
we have a direct and long standing relationship with a significant number of institutional investors 
we tailor industrial portfolios to investors specific needs and deploy capital in both close ended and open ended structures  while providing complete portfolio management and financial reporting services 
we generally own in the ventures 
we believe our co investment in each of our ventures provides a strong alignment of interests with our co investment partners interests 
we generate revenues from our unconsolidated co investment ventures by providing asset management and property management services 
we may also earn revenues through additional services provided such as leasing  acquisition  construction  development  disposition  legal and tax services 
depending on the structure of the venture and the returns provided to our partners  we may also earn revenues through incentive returns or promotes 
we believe our co investment program with private capital investors will continue to serve as a source of capital for new investments and provide revenues for our stockholders  as well as mitigate risk associated with our foreign currency exposure 
we expect to grow this business with the formation of new ventures and by raising additional third party capital in our existing ventures 
in  we recognized income in the cdfs business segment related to gains from the japan property funds that were deferred upon original contributions and triggered with the sale of our investments 
we no longer have a cdfs business segment 

table of contents summary of during the year ended december   we completed the following activities in support of our strategic priorities completed the merger on june  and have completed the majority of the integration activities 
completed the pepr acquisition in may in connection with the merger and pepr acquisition  we increased our debt to billion at june  as of december   we have reduced our debt to billion due primarily to repayments that were funded with proceeds from dispositions of properties 
as of june  our total owned and managed portfolio  including consolidated and unconsolidated properties  was occupied and leased 
as a result of significant leasing activity in the second half of we increased to occupied and leased  as of december  issued million shares of common stock in a public offering at a price of per share  generating approximately billion in net proceeds equity offering in late june entered into a new global senior credit agreement  terminated our existing global line of credit and amended a yen revolving credit agreement 
completed an exchange offer in june for prologis senior notes and exchangeable senior notes 
operational outlook despite the ongoing slowdown in the global economic recovery  fourth quarter real estate fundamentals in the us industrial markets continued to improve consistent with the improvement we saw in the third quarter 
though down from its rebound third quarter level  net absorption of us industrial space measured million square feet in the fourth quarter 
net absorption has been positive for the last six consecutive quarters  reducing the availability rate by basis points during that time 
at  availability is at its lowest level since the second quarter of net effective rent has made modest improvements  and as a result  some speculative development is beginning in selected locations such as miami  washington dc  seattle  southern california  and houston 
though economic growth remains relatively moderate  inventories continue to rise  and utilization rates have been on an overall upward trajectory since late in the us  net absorption totaled more than million square feet in  representing a remarkable improvement over the past few years  and we expect net absorption of million square feet in within europe and japan  we believe significant supply chain reconfiguration  the ongoing globalization of central and eastern europe  obsolescence and strong tenant preference to rent rather than own will fuel additional demand for industrial space 
moreover  the undersupply of class a distribution space in japan has and will continue to create demand for more modern  earthquake resistant product  especially as japan rebuilds and regroups from the march earthquake and tsunami  which temporarily interrupted its supply chain 
demand in emerging markets where we have investments primarily through our co investment ventures  such as brazil  china  and mexico  remains strong 
in our total owned and managed operating portfolio  which includes properties managed by us and owned by our unconsolidated co investment ventures that are accounted for under the equity method and including properties that were part of the merger  we leased million square feet of space in excluding the properties that were part of the merger  we leased million square feet of space during the year ended december  the effective rental rates on leases signed during the fourth quarter of in our same store portfolio as defined below decreased by when compared with the rental rates on the previous leases on that same space 
the total owned and managed portfolio was occupied at december   up from at december  our existing customers renewed their leases of the time in as compared with in we believe that capital deployment opportunities are increasing and we are currently evaluating multiple opportunities in our global and regional markets around the globe 
our development business consists of speculative development  build to suit development  value added coversions and redevelopment 
we expect to develop directly and within the co investment structures depending on location  market conditions  submarkets or building sites  and availability of capital 
we believe that developing  redeveloping and or expanding of well located  high quality industrial properties provides higher rates of return than may be obtained from purchasing existing properties 
however  development projects may require significant management attention and capital investment to maximize returns 
during  in response to this emerging demand  we including prologis  amb pre merger  and unconsolidated entities commenced development of properties totaling million square feet with a total expected investment of billion 
of this amount  million is our share and million is the share of our co investment venture partners

as discussed earlier  results for included approximately seven months of rental income and expenses from the properties acquired through the merger and pepr acquisition 
the results of properties that were sold to third parties are presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements in item for all periods and therefore do not impact the segment results 
the net operating income from the real estate operations segment for the years ended december  was as follows in thousands rental and other income rental and other expenses total net operating income real estate operations segment the increases in rental income and rental expenses in from are due principally to the impact of the merger and the pepr acquisition  increased occupancy in our consolidated operating portfolio from at december  to at december  and the completion and stabilization of new development properties

in our consolidated portfolio  we leased million square feet in compared to million square feet in the increase in net operating income in over is due primarily to increased occupancy in the development portfolio 
we calculate the change in effective rental rates on the previous leases on that same space for leases signed during a quarter  based on our same store portfolio as defined below 
during over the four quarters  the percentage change in rental rates ranged from a decrease of to a decrease of 
during over the four quarters  the percentage change in rental rates ranged from a decrease of to a decrease of 
the decrease was due to i leases turning that were put in place when market rents were at or near peak  and ii decreased market rents 
under the terms of our lease agreements  we are able to recover the majority of our rental expenses from customers 
rental expense recoveries  included in both rental income and rental expenses  were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively

in addition  in order to achieve efficiencies and economies of scale  all of our property management functions are provided by a team of professionals who are assigned to our real estate operations segment 
these individuals perform the property level management of the properties in our owned and managed portfolio including properties we consolidate and the properties we manage that are owned by the unconsolidated investees 
we allocate the costs of our property management function to the properties we consolidate reported in rental expenses and the properties owned by the unconsolidated investees included in private capital expenses  by using the square feet owned by the respective portfolios 
the increase in private capital expenses in is due to the increased private capital platform and infrastructure that was part of the merger  offset partially with a decline in the portion of our property management expenses that are allocated to this segment due to the consolidation of pepr 
the net operating income from the private capital segment for the years ended december was as follows in thousands unconsolidated ventures americas europe asia total net operating income private capital segment represents the fees earned by us from  and unconsolidated co investment ventures for each of the years ended december   and  respectively  reduced by private capital expenses

at the end of  in response to the difficult economic climate  we initiated g a expense reductions 
these initiatives included a rif plan that had a total cost of million in the year ended december  the increase in g a expenses and the various components from to is primarily due to the merger  pepr acquisition and the larger infrastructure associated with our larger company 
overall g a expense decreased from to due to lower gross g a expense  as a result of the rif program in and various cost savings measures  offset by lower capitalized g a 
merger  acquisition and other integration expenses in connection with the merger and other related activities  we have incurred significant transaction  integration  and transitional costs 
these costs include investment banker advisory fees  legal  tax  accounting and valuation fees  termination and severance costs both cash and stock based compensation awards for terminated and transitional employees  system conversion costs  and other integration costs 
these costs are expensed as incurred 
the costs that were obligations of amb and expensed pre merger are not included in our consolidated financial statements 
at the time of the merger  we terminated our existing credit facilities and wrote off the remaining unamortized deferred loan costs associated with such facilities  which are included as a merger expense 
in addition  we have included costs associated with the acquisition of a controlling interest in pepr and the reduction in workforce charges associated with dispositions made in we expect to continue to recognize costs  primarily compensation and severance costs for transitional employees and system conversion and implementation costs through the end of as incurred 
the following is a breakdown of the costs incurred during in thousands termination  severance and transitional employee costs professional fees office closure  travel and other costs write off of deferred loan costs total the majority of the costs incurred in were incurred during the second quarter of when the merger and the pepr acquisition were completed 
impairment of real estate properties during  and  we recognized impairment charges of real estate properties in continuing operations of million  million and million  respectively  due to our change of intent to no longer hold these assets for long term investment 
in  the charges primarily included land as a result of our change in strategy 
changes in economic and operating conditions and our ultimate investment intent with regard to our investments in real estate that occur in the future may result in additional impairment charges or gains at the time of sale 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in item for more detail on the process we took to value these assets and the related impairments taken 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase from to is primarily due to additional depreciation and amortization expenses associated with the properties acquired through the merger and pepr acquisition including intangible assets  completed and leased development properties and increased leasing activity 
the increase from to is due to the completion  retention and leasing of our developed properties 

table of contents interest expense interest expense from continued operations  included the following components in thousands for the years ended december gross interest expense amortization of discount  net amortization of deferred loan costs interest expense before capitalization capitalized amounts net interest expense gross interest expense increased in from due primarily to higher debt levels as a result of the merger and pepr acquisition  offset partially by decreased interest rates 
the decrease in capitalized amounts in from was due to lower interest rates during during the first part of  we had lower debt balances as a result of repayment and repurchases of debt made in with proceeds from asset sales and the november equity offering 
we reduced our outstanding debt at december  to billion 
in connection with the merger and pepr acquisition  we added approximately billion of debt at fair value at the beginning of june and approximately seven months of related interest expense in at december   our debt balance was billion  a decrease from billion at june   primarily due to repayments funded by proceeds received from the dispositions of properties 
all of these activities have resulted in a lower weighted average effective interest rate including amortization of premiums  discounts and deferred loan costs of in  as compared with in the increase in interest expense in over is due to increased borrowing rates and lower capitalization due to less development activity in in addition  in we wrote off million in deferred loan costs based on the proportionate amount that we reduced our borrowing capacity on our global line of credit 
the lower amortization of discount is due to the buyback of exchangeable debt that includes a non cash discount 
our weighted average effective interest rate including amortization of deferred loan costs was for the year ended december  our future interest expense  both gross and the portion capitalized  will vary depending on  among other things  the level of our development activities  which we expect will increase subsequent to the merger 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements in item and liquidity and capital resources for further discussion of our debt and borrowing costs 
earnings from unconsolidated investees  net we recognized net earnings of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these earnings relate to our investment in unconsolidated investees that are accounted for on the equity method 
the primary reason for the increase in over is due to the investments we acquired through the merger  partially offset by the consolidation of pepr 
the earnings we recognize are impacted by i variances in revenues and expenses of the entity  ii the size and occupancy rate of the portfolio of properties owned by the entity  iii our ownership interest in the entity  and iv fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates used to translate our share of net earnings to us dollars  if applicable 
we manage the majority of the properties in which we have an ownership interest as part of our total owned and managed portfolio 
see discussion of our portfolio results in the section  portfolio information 
see also note to our consolidated financial statements in item for further breakdown of our share of net earnings recognized 
impairment of goodwill and other assets based on our review of goodwill in  we recognized an impairment charge of million related to goodwill allocated to the real estate operations segment in the americas and europe reporting units 
the review of goodwill was triggered by the strategic decision we made in the fourth quarter of to significantly downsize our development platform and  as a result  to sell to third parties certain other assets  some of which were acquired in the acquisitions that originally created the goodwill 
in  and  we recorded impairment charges of million  million and million  respectively  on certain of our investments in and advances to unconsolidated investees  notes receivable and other assets  as we did not believe these amounts to be recoverable based on the present value of the estimated future cash flows associated with these assets  including estimated sales proceeds or we believed the decline in fair value to be other than temporary

gains on acquisitions and dispositions of investments in real estate  net during  we recognized net gains on acquisitions and dispositions of investments in real estate in continuing operations of million 
this included gains recognized in the second quarter related to the pepr acquisition million and the acquisition of our partner s interest in a joint venture in japan million and the contribution or sale of properties to unconsolidated co investment ventures 
the gains represent the adjustment to fair value of our equity investments at the time we gained control and consolidated the entities 
the contribution activity resulted in cash proceeds of million and net gains of million 
during  we recognized net gains on dispositions of investments in real estate in continuing operations of million  which related to the contribution of land and operating properties to unconsolidated investees million gain  additional proceeds from contributions we made to pepf ii in based on valuations received as of december  and our contribution agreement with the fund million gain and the sale of land parcels to third parties million gain  offset by a loss of million related to the sale of certain unconsolidated investees 
the contribution activity resulted in cash proceeds of million related to the contribution of development properties aggregating million square feet and land to unconsolidated investees  and the sale of of two development properties in japan with million square feet 
we continue to own of the japan properties  which are accounted for under the equity method of accounting  and we continue to manage the properties

the contribution activity resulted in total cash proceeds of million and included properties aggregating million square feet to pepf ii 
if we realize a gain on contribution or sale of a property to an unconsolidated investee  we recognize the portion attributable to the third party ownership in the entity 
if we realize a loss on contribution  we recognize the full amount as soon as it is known 
due to our continuing involvement through our ownership in the co investment venture  these dispositions are not included in discontinued operations 
foreign currency exchange and derivative gains losses  net we and certain of our foreign consolidated subsidiaries may have intercompany or third party debt that is not denominated in the entity s functional currency 
when the debt is remeasured against the functional currency of the entity  a gain or loss may result 
to mitigate our foreign currency exchange exposure  we borrow in the functional currency of the borrowing entity when appropriate 
certain of our intercompany debt is remeasured with the resulting adjustment recognized as a cumulative translation adjustment in foreign currency translation gains losses  net in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss 
this treatment is applicable to intercompany debt that is deemed to be long term in nature 
if the intercompany debt is deemed short term in nature  when the debt is remeasured  we recognize a gain or loss in earnings 
we recognized net foreign currency exchange losses of million and losses of million in and  respectively  and gains of million in  related to the remeasurement of debt 
predominantly the gains or losses recognized in earnings relate to the remeasurement of intercompany loans between the us parent and certain consolidated subsidiaries in japan and europe and result from fluctuations in the exchange rates of us dollars to the euro  japanese yen  british pound sterling and singapore dollar 
in addition  we recognized net foreign currency exchange gains of million and million and losses of million from the settlement of transactions with third parties during december   and  respectively 
in connection with the merger and the exchange offer discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements in item  our convertible senior notes became exchangeable senior notes issued by the operating partnership that are exchangeable into common stock of the reit 
as a result  the accounting for the exchangeable senior notes has changed and  we are now required to separate the fair value of the derivative instrument exchange feature from the debt instrument and account for it separately as a derivative 
we adjust the derivative instrument at each reporting period to fair value with the resulting adjustment being recorded in earnings 
in  we recognized an unrealized gain of million 
gains losses on early extinguishment of debt  net during the years ended december   and  we purchased portions of several series of senior notes  senior exchangeable notes and eurobonds outstanding and extinguished some secured mortgage debt prior to maturity  which resulted in the recognition of gains of million in  losses of million in  and gains of million in the gains or losses represent the difference between the recorded debt net of premiums and discounts and including related debt issuance costs and the consideration we paid to retire the debt  including fees 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in item for more information regarding our debt repurchases 

table of contents income tax benefit expense during the years ended december   and  our current income tax expense was million  million and million  respectively 
we recognize current income tax expense for income taxes incurred by our taxable reit subsidiaries and in certain foreign jurisdictions  as well as certain state taxes 
we also include in current income tax expense the interest associated with our liability for uncertain tax positions 
our current income tax expense fluctuates from period to period based primarily on the timing of our taxable income and changes in tax and interest rates 
in  and  we recognized a net deferred tax benefit of million  million and million  respectively 
deferred income tax expense is generally a function of the period s temporary differences and the utilization of net operating losses generated in prior years that had been previously recognized as deferred income tax assets in certain of our taxable subsidiaries operating in the us or in foreign jurisdictions 
the deferred tax benefit recorded during is primarily due to impairment charges recorded to the book basis of real estate properties and investments in unconsolidated investees  net operating loss nol carryforwards recorded for certain jurisdictions  and the reversal of deferred tax liabilities related to built in gains 
in addition  during the second quarter of  we recognized a deferred income tax benefit of approximately million resulting from the conversion of two of our european management companies to taxable entities 
this conversion was approved by the applicable tax authorities in june and created an asset for tax purposes that will be utilized against future taxable income as it is amortized 
the deferred tax benefit was partially offset by an increase to the valuation allowance in certain jurisdictions because we could not sustain a conclusion that it was more likely than not that we could realize the deferred tax assets and nol carryforwards 
our income taxes are discussed in more detail in note to our consolidated financial statements in item discontinued operations discontinued operations represent a component of an entity that has either been disposed of or is classified as held for sale if both the operations and cash flows of the component have been or will be eliminated from ongoing operations of the entity as a result of the disposal transaction and the entity will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the component after the disposal transaction 
the results of operations of the component of the entity that has been classified as discontinued operations are reported separately in our consolidated financial statements in item during  and  we disposed of land subject to ground leases and  and properties  respectively  to third parties that met the requirements to be classified as discontinued operations 
therefore  the results of operations for these disposed properties are included in discontinued operations for all periods presented  along with the gains recognized during the period 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements in item other comprehensive income loss foreign currency translation losses  net for our consolidated subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the us dollar  we translate their financial statements into us dollars at the time we consolidate those subsidiaries financial statements 
generally  assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect as of the balance sheet date 
the resulting translation adjustments  due to the fluctuations in exchange rates from the beginning of the period to the end of the period  are included in other comprehensive income loss 
during  we recorded unrealized net losses in other comprehensive income loss of million that related to foreign currency translations of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars upon consolidation 
the euro and pound sterling remained relatively flat from december  to december   but both weakened to the us dollar from the merger and pepr acquisition date to december  these losses were offset slightly by the strengthening of the yen to the us dollar during during  we recognized unrealized net losses in other comprehensive income loss of million related to foreign currency translations of our international business units into us dollars upon consolidation  mainly as a result of the yen strengthening against the us dollar  partially offset by the strengthening of the us dollar to the euro and pound sterling  from the beginning of the year to december  during  we recognized unrealized net gains in other comprehensive income loss of million 
this includes million in gains  mainly as a result of the strengthening of the british pound sterling to the us dollar offset partially by the strengthening of the us dollar to the euro and yen 
these gains were offset by a decrease in other comprehensive income of million  as a result of the sale of our china operations and our investments in the japan property funds in february  and represents the gains previously included as currency translation adjustments 

table of contents portfolio information our total owned and managed portfolio of properties includes operating industrial properties and does not include properties under development  properties held for sale or non industrial properties and was as follows as of december square feet in thousands number of properties square feet number of properties square feet number of properties square feet consolidated unconsolidated totals same store analysis we evaluate the performance of the operating properties we own and manage using a same store analysis because the population of properties in this analysis is consistent from period to period  thereby eliminating the effects of changes in the composition of the portfolio on performance measures 
we include properties owned by us  and properties owned by the unconsolidated co investment ventures accounted for on the equity method that are managed by us referred to as unconsolidated investees  in our same store analysis 
we have defined the same store portfolio  for the three months ended december   as those properties that were in operation at january  and also december   including completed development properties 
we have removed all properties that were disposed of to a third party or were classified as held for sale from the population for both periods 
we believe the factors that impact rental income  rental expenses and net operating income in the same store portfolio are generally the same as for the total portfolio 
in order to derive an appropriate measure of period to period operating performance  we remove the effects of foreign currency exchange rate movements by using the current exchange rate to translate from local currency into us dollars  for both periods 
the same store portfolio included million of aggregated square feet 
the following is a reconciliation of our consolidated rental income  rental expenses and net operating income calculated as rental income less rental expenses for the full year  as included in our consolidated statements of operations in item  to the respective amounts in our same store portfolio analysis

in addition  we have included the properties owned and managed by amb as of january  that we still own at december  in the same store portfolio 
during the periods presented  certain properties owned by us were contributed to an unconsolidated investee and are included in the same store portfolio on an aggregate basis 
neither our consolidated results nor that of the unconsolidated investees  when viewed individually  would be comparable on a same store basis due to the changes in composition of the respective portfolios from period to period for example  the results of a contributed property would be included in our consolidated results through the contribution date and in the results of the unconsolidated investee subsequent to the contribution date 
we exclude the net termination and renegotiation fees from our same store rental income to allow us to evaluate the growth or decline in each property s rental income without regard to items that are not indicative of the property s recurring operating performance 
net termination and renegotiation fees represent the gross fee negotiated to allow a customer to terminate or renegotiate their lease  offset by the write off of the asset recognized due to the adjustment to straight line rents over the lease term 
the adjustments to remove these items are included as effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other in the tables above 

table of contents these amounts include rental income  rental expenses and net operating income of both our consolidated industrial properties and those owned by our unconsolidated investees accounted for on the equity method and managed by us 
rental expenses in the same store portfolio include the direct operating expenses of the property such as property taxes  insurance  utilities  etc 
in addition  we include an allocation of the property management expenses for our direct owned properties based on the property management fee that is provided for in the individual management agreements under which our wholly owned management companies provide property management services to each property generally  the fee is based on a percentage of revenues 
on consolidation  the management fee income earned by the management companies and the management fee expense recognized by the properties are eliminated and the actual costs of providing property management services are recognized as part of our consolidated rental expenses 
these expenses fluctuate based on the level of properties included in the same store portfolio and any adjustment is included as effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other in the above table 
environmental matters a majority of the properties acquired by us were subjected to environmental reviews either by us or the previous owners 
while some of these assessments have led to further investigation and sampling  none of the environmental assessments have revealed an environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we record a liability for the estimated costs of environmental remediation to be incurred in connection with certain operating properties we acquire  as well as certain land parcels we acquire in connection with the planned development of the land 
the liability is established to cover the environmental remediation costs  including cleanup costs  consulting fees for studies and investigations  monitoring costs and legal costs relating to cleanup  litigation defense  and the pursuit of responsible third parties 
we purchase various environmental insurance policies to mitigate our exposure to environmental liabilities 
we are not aware of any environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources overview we consider our ability to generate cash from operating activities  dispositions of properties and from available financing sources to be adequate to meet our anticipated future development  acquisition  operating  debt service  dividend and distribution requirements 
near term principal cash sources and uses in addition to dividends to the common and preferred stockholders of the reit and distributions to the limited partnership units of the operating partnership  we expect our primary cash needs will consist of the following completion of the development and leasing of the properties in our consolidated development portfolio a  investments in current or future unconsolidated investees  primarily for the development and or acquisition of properties depending on market and other conditions b  development of new properties for long term investment  repayment of debt  including payments on our credit facilities and repurchases of senior notes and or exchangeable senior notes  scheduled consolidated debt principal payments in of billion  capital expenditures and leasing costs on properties  depending on market and other conditions  acquisition of operating properties and or portfolios of operating properties in global or regional markets for direct  long term investment this might include acquisitions from our co investment ventures  and merger integration and transition expenses

the loans can be obtained in us dollars  euros  japanese yen  and british pounds sterling 
we may increase the borrowings to approximately million  subject to obtaining additional lender commitments 
the loan agreement is scheduled to mature on february   but we may extend the maturity date three times  in each case up to one year  subject to satisfaction of certain conditions and payment of an extension fee 
we used the proceeds from this senior term loan to pay off the two outstanding term loans assumed in connection with the merger and the remainder to pay down borrowings on the credit facilities 

table of contents equity commitments related to certain co investment ventures certain co investment ventures have equity commitments from us and our venture partners 
we may fulfill our equity commitment through contributions of properties or cash

these ventures are committed to acquire such properties  subject to certain exceptions  including that the properties meet certain specified leasing and other criteria  and that the ventures have available capital 
generally the venture obtains financing for the properties and therefore the equity commitment is less than the acquisition price of the real estate

distribution and dividend requirements our dividend policy on our common stock is to distribute a percentage of our cash flow to ensure we will meet the dividend requirements of the internal revenue code  relative to maintaining our reit status  while still allowing us to retain cash to meet other needs such as capital improvements and other investment activities 
prior to the merger  prologis paid a cash distribution of adjusted by merger exchange ratio per common share for the first quarter on february  and for the second quarter on may  also prior to the merger  amb paid a dividend of per common share on february  for the first quarter and on may  for the second quarter 
neither amb dividend has been reflected in the consolidated financial statements in item since prologis is the accounting acquirer  as discussed earlier 
we paid a cash dividend of per common share for each of the third and fourth quarters of a cash distribution of for the first quarter of was declared on february  this distribution will be paid on march  to holders of common shares on march  our future common stock dividends may vary and will be determined by our board upon the circumstances prevailing at the time  including our financial condition  operating results and reit distribution requirements  and may be adjusted at the discretion of the board during the year 
at december   we had seven series of preferred stock outstanding 
the annual dividend rates on preferred stock are per series l share  per series m share  per series o share  per series p share  per series q share  per series r share and per series s share 
the series q  r and s were preferred shares of beneficial interest in prologis prior to the merger and distributions on those shares have been reflected in the consolidated financial statements in item through december  the dividends on the remaining preferred stock have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the merger 
the dividends on preferred stock are payable quarterly in arrears 
pursuant to the terms of our preferred stock  we are restricted from declaring or paying any dividend with respect to our common stock unless and until all cumulative dividends with respect to the preferred stock has been paid and sufficient funds have been set aside for dividends that have been declared for the relevant dividend period with respect to the preferred stock 
critical accounting policies a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of an entity s financial condition and results of operations and requires judgment on the part of management 
generally  the judgment requires management to make estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
estimates are prepared using management s best judgment  after considering past and current economic conditions and expectations for the future 
the current economic environment has increased the degree of uncertainty inherent in these estimates and assumptions 
changes in estimates could affect our financial position and specific items in our results of operations that are used by stockholders  potential investors  industry analysts and lenders in their evaluation of our performance 
of the accounting policies discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements in item  those presented below have been identified by us as critical accounting policies 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets and goodwill we assess the carrying values of our respective long lived assets  including goodwill  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable 
recoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
in order to review our real estate assets for recoverability  we consider current market conditions  as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset 
our intent with regard to the underlying assets might change as market conditions change  as well as other factors  especially in the current global economic environment 
fair value is determined through various valuation techniques  including discounted cash flow models  applying a capitalization rate to estimated net operating income of a property  quoted market values and third party appraisals  where considered necessary 
the use of projected future cash flows is based on assumptions that are consistent with our estimates of future expectations and the strategic plan we use to manage our underlying business 
if our analysis indicates that the carrying value of the real estate asset is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis  we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the current estimated fair value of the real estate property 
we use a two step approach to our goodwill impairment evaluation 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify whether there is any potential impairment 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its corresponding book value  including goodwill  the goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered to be impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the impairment test is performed 
the second step requires that we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
assumptions and estimates used in the recoverability analyses for future cash flows  discount rates and capitalization rates are complex and subjective 
changes in economic and operating conditions or our intent with regard to our investment that occurs subsequent to our impairment analyses could impact these assumptions and result in future impairment of our real estate properties and or goodwill 
other than temporary impairment of investments in unconsolidated investees when circumstances indicate there may have been a reduction in the value of an equity investment  we evaluate whether the loss in value is other than temporary 
if we determine there is a loss in value that is other than temporary  we recognize an impairment charge to reflect the investment at fair value 
the use of projected future cash flows and other estimates of fair value  the determination of when a loss is other than temporary  and the calculation of the amount of the loss  is complex and subjective 
use of other estimates and assumptions may result in different conclusions 
changes in economic and operating conditions  as well as changes in our intent with regard to our investment  that occur subsequent to our review could impact these assumptions and result in future impairment charges of our equity investments 
revenue recognition gains on disposition of real estate we recognize gains from the contributions and sales of real estate assets  generally at the time the title is transferred  consideration is received and we no longer have substantial continuing involvement with the real estate sold 
in many of our transactions  an entity in which we have an ownership interest will acquire a real estate asset from us 
we make judgments based on the specific terms of each transaction as to the amount of the total profit from the transaction that we recognize given our continuing ownership interest and our level of future involvement with the investee that acquires the assets 
we also make judgments regarding recognition in earnings of certain fees and incentives based on when they are earned  fixed and determinable 
business combinations we acquire individual properties  as well as portfolios of properties  or businesses 
when we acquire a business or individual operating properties  with the intention to hold the investment for the long term  we allocate the purchase price to the various components of the acquisition based upon the fair value of each component 
the components typically include land  building  debt  intangible assets related to above and below market leases  value of costs to obtain tenants  deferred tax liabilities and other assumed assets and liabilities in the case of an acquisition of a business 
in an acquisition of multiple properties  we must also allocate the purchase price among the properties 
the allocation of the purchase price is based on our assessment of estimated fair value and often times is based upon the expected future cash flows of the property and various characteristics of the markets where the property is located 
the fair value may also include an enterprise value premium that we estimate a third party would be willing to pay for a portfolio of properties 
the initial allocation of the purchase price is based on management s preliminary assessment  which may differ when final information becomes available 
subsequent adjustments made to the initial purchase price allocation are made within the allocation period  which typically does not exceed one year 
consolidation we consolidate all entities that are wholly owned and those in which we own less than but control  as well as any variable interest entities in which we are the primary beneficiary 
we evaluate our ability to control an entity and whether the entity is a variable interest entity and we are the primary beneficiary through consideration of the substantive terms of the arrangement to identify which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impacts the entity s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity 
investments in entities in which we do not control but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are presented under the equity method 
investments in entities that we do not control and over which we do not exercise significant influence are carried at the lower of cost or fair value  as appropriate 
our ability to correctly assess our influence and or control over an entity affects the presentation of these investments in our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents capitalization of costs and depreciation we capitalize costs incurred in developing  renovating  rehabilitating  and improving real estate assets as part of the investment basis 
costs incurred in making repairs and maintaining real estate assets are expensed as incurred 
during the land development and construction periods  we capitalize interest costs  insurance  real estate taxes and certain general and administrative costs of the personnel performing development  renovations  and rehabilitation if such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific activity to get the asset ready for its intended use 
capitalized costs are included in the investment basis of real estate assets 
we also capitalize costs incurred to successfully originate a lease that result directly from  and are essential to  the acquisition of that lease 
leasing costs that meet the requirements for capitalization are presented as a component of other assets 
we estimate the depreciable portion of our real estate assets and related useful lives in order to record depreciation expense 
our ability to estimate the depreciable portions of our real estate assets and useful lives is critical to the determination of the appropriate amount of depreciation expense recorded and the carrying value of the underlying assets 
any change to the assets to be depreciated and the estimated depreciable lives of these assets would have an impact on the depreciation expense recognized 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  significant management judgment is required to estimate our income tax liability  the liability associated with open tax years that are under review and our compliance with reit requirements 
our estimates are based on interpretation of tax laws 
we estimate our actual current income tax due and assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for book and tax purposes resulting in the recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
these estimates may have an impact on the income tax expense recognized 
adjustments may be required by a change in assessment of our deferred income tax assets and liabilities  changes in assessments of the recognition of income tax benefits for certain non routine transactions  changes due to audit adjustments by federal and state tax authorities  our inability to qualify as a reit  the potential for built in gain recognition  changes in the assessment of properties to be contributed to taxable reit subsidiaries and changes in tax laws 
adjustments required in any given period are included within income tax expense 
we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities 
new accounting pronouncements see note to our consolidated financial statements in item funds from operations ffo ffo is a non gaap measure that is commonly used in the real estate industry 
the most directly comparable gaap measure to ffo is net earnings 
although the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit has published a definition of ffo  which was amended in late  further modifications to the nareit calculation of ffo are common among reits  as companies seek to provide financial measures that meaningfully reflect their business 
ffo is not meant to represent a comprehensive system of financial reporting and does not present  nor do we intend it to present  a complete picture of our financial condition and operating performance 
we believe net earnings computed under gaap remains the primary measure of performance and that ffo is only meaningful when it is used in conjunction with net earnings computed under gaap 
further  we believe our consolidated financial statements  prepared in accordance with gaap  provide the most meaningful picture of our financial condition and our operating performance 
nareit s ffo measure adjusts net earnings computed under gaap to exclude historical cost depreciation  gains and losses from the sales of  and impairment charges of  previously depreciated properties 
we agree that these nareit adjustments are useful to investors for the following reasons historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap assumes  through depreciation charges  that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
nareit stated in its white paper on ffo since real estate asset values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
consequently  nareit s definition of ffo reflects the fact that real estate  as an asset class  generally appreciates over time and depreciation charges required by gaap do not reflect the underlying economic realities 
reits were created as a legal form of organization in order to encourage public ownership of real estate as an asset class through investment in firms that were in the business of long term ownership and management of real estate 
the exclusion  in nareit s definition of ffo  of gains and losses from the sales of  and impairment charges of  previously depreciated operating real estate assets allows investors and analysts to readily identify the operating results of the long term assets that form the core of a reit s activity and assists in comparing those operating results between periods 
we include the gains and losses from dispositions of land and development properties in ffo 
as a result  if we recognize impairment charges related to these types of properties  we also include the impairment charges in the calculation of ffo as defined by nareit 
we exclude from ffo as defined by nareit gains and losses from dispositions of properties  other than land and development properties  which we refer to as non ffo properties  as well as any related impairment charges 
we include or exclude our share of these items recognized by our unconsolidated investees on the same basis 

table of contents our ffo measures at the same time that nareit created and defined its ffo measure for the reit industry  it also recognized that management of each of its member companies has the responsibility and authority to publish financial information that it regards as useful to the financial community 
we believe stockholders  potential investors and financial analysts who review our operating results are best served by a defined ffo measure that includes other adjustments to net earnings computed under gaap in addition to those included in the nareit defined measure of ffo 
our ffo measures are used by management in analyzing our business and the performance of our properties and we believe that it is important that stockholders  potential investors and financial analysts understand the measures management uses 
we use these ffo measures  including by segment and region  to i evaluate our performance and the performance of our properties in comparison to expected results and results of previous periods  relative to resource allocation decisions  ii evaluate the performance of our management  iii budget and forecast future results to assist in the allocation of resources  iv assess our operating performance as compared to similar real estate companies and the industry in general  and v evaluate how a specific potential investment will impact our future results 
because we make decisions with regard to our performance with a long term outlook  we believe it is appropriate to remove the effects of items that we do not expect to affect the underlying long term performance of the properties 
the long term performance of our properties is principally driven by rental income 
while not infrequent or unusual  these additional items we exclude in calculating our ffo measures are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period that cause both positive and negative short term effects on our results of operations  in inconsistent and unpredictable directions that are not relevant to our long term outlook 
we use our ffo measures as supplemental financial measures of operating performance 
we do not use our ffo measures as  nor should they be considered to be  alternatives to net earnings computed under gaap  as indicators of our operating performance  as alternatives to cash from operating activities computed under gaap or as indicators of our ability to fund our cash needs 
ffo  as defined by prologis to arrive at ffo  as defined by prologis  we adjust the nareit defined ffo measure to exclude i deferred income tax benefits and deferred income tax expenses recognized by our subsidiaries  ii current income tax expense related to acquired tax liabilities that were recorded as deferred tax liabilities in an acquisition  to the extent the expense is offset with a deferred income tax benefit in gaap earnings that is excluded from our defined ffo measure  iii foreign currency exchange gains and losses resulting from debt transactions between us and our foreign consolidated subsidiaries and our foreign unconsolidated investees  iv foreign currency exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement based on current foreign currency exchange rates of certain third party debt of our foreign consolidated subsidiaries and our foreign unconsolidated investees  and v mark to market adjustments associated with derivative financial instruments 
we calculate ffo  as defined by prologis for our unconsolidated investees on the same basis as we calculate our ffo  as defined by prologis 
we believe investors are best served if the information that is made available to them allows them to align their analysis and evaluation of our operating results along the same lines that our management uses in planning and executing our business strategy 
core ffo in addition to ffo  as defined by prologis  we also use core ffo 
to arrive at core ffo  we adjust ffo  as defined by prologis  to exclude the following recurring and non recurring items that we recognized directly or our share recognized by our unconsolidated investees to the extent they are included in ffo  as defined by prologis i gains or losses from acquisition  contribution or sale of land or development properties  ii income tax expense related to the sale of investments in real estate  iii impairment charges recognized related to our investments in real estate either directly or through our investments in unconsolidated investees generally as a result of our change in intent to contribute or sell these properties  iv impairment charges of goodwill and other assets  v gains or losses from the early extinguishment of debt  vi merger  acquisition and other integration expenses  and vii expenses related to natural disasters we believe it is appropriate to further adjust our ffo  as defined by prologis for certain recurring items as they were driven by transactional activity and factors relating to the financial and real estate markets  rather than factors specific to the on going operating performance of our properties or investments 
the impairment charges we recognized were primarily based on valuations of real estate  which had declined due to market conditions  that we no longer expected to hold for long term investment 
we currently have and have had over the past several years a stated priority to strengthen our financial position 
we expect to accomplish this by reducing our debt  our investment in certain low yielding assets  such as land that we decide not to develop and our exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations 
as a result  we have sold to third parties or contributed to unconsolidated investees real estate properties that  depending on market conditions  might result in a gain or loss 
the impairment charges related to goodwill and other assets that we have recognized were similarly caused by the decline in the real 
table of contents estate markets 
also in connection with our stated priority to reduce debt and extend debt maturities  we have purchased portions of our debt securities 
as a result  we recognized net gains or losses on the early extinguishment of certain debt due to the financial market conditions at that time 
we have also adjusted for some non recurring items 
the merger  acquisition and other integration expenses include costs we incurred in and that we expect to incur in associated with the merger and pepr acquisition and the integration of our systems and processes 
we have not adjusted for the acquisition costs that we have incurred as a result of routine acquisitions but only the costs associated with significant business combinations that we would expect to be infrequent in nature 
similarly  the expenses related to the natural disaster in japan that we recognized in are a rare occurrence but we may incur similar expenses again in the future 
we analyze our operating performance primarily by the rental income of our real estate and the revenue driven by our private capital business  net of operating  administrative and financing expenses 
this income stream is not directly impacted by fluctuations in the market value of our investments in real estate or debt securities 
as a result  although these items have had a material impact on our operations and are reflected in our financial statements  the removal of the effects of these items allows us to better understand the core operating performance of our properties over the long term 
we use core ffo  including by segment and region  to i evaluate our performance and the performance of our properties in comparison to expected results and results of previous periods  relative to resource allocation decisions  ii evaluate the performance of our management  iii budget and forecast future results to assist in the allocation of resources  iv provide guidance to the financial markets to understand our expected operating performance  v assess our operating performance as compared to similar real estate companies and the industry in general  and vi evaluate how a specific potential investment will impact our future results 
because we make decisions with regard to our performance with a long term outlook  we believe it is appropriate to remove the effects of items that we do not expect to affect the underlying long term performance of the properties we own 
as noted above  we believe the long term performance of our properties is principally driven by rental income 
we believe investors are best served if the information that is made available to them allows them to align their analysis and evaluation of our operating results along the same lines that our management uses in planning and executing our business strategy 
limitations on use of our ffo measures while we believe our defined ffo measures are important supplemental measures  neither nareit s nor our measures of ffo should be used alone because they exclude significant economic components of net earnings computed under gaap and are  therefore  limited as an analytical tool 
accordingly  they are only part of many measures we use when analyzing our business 
some of these limitations are the current income tax expenses that are excluded from our defined ffo measures represent the taxes that are payable 
depreciation and amortization of real estate assets are economic costs that are excluded from ffo 
ffo is limited  as it does not reflect the cash requirements that may be necessary for future replacements of the real estate assets 
further  the amortization of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of industrial properties are not reflected in ffo 
gains or losses from property acquisitions and dispositions or impairment charges related to expected dispositions represent changes in the value of the properties 
by excluding these gains and losses  our ffo measures do not capture realized changes in the value of acquired or disposed properties arising from changes in market conditions 
the deferred income tax benefits and expenses that are excluded from our defined ffo measures result from the creation of a deferred income tax asset or liability that may have to be settled at some future point 
our defined ffo measures do not currently reflect any income or expense that may result from such settlement 
the foreign currency exchange gains and losses that are excluded from our defined ffo measures are generally recognized based on movements in foreign currency exchange rates through a specific point in time 
the ultimate settlement of our foreign currency denominated net assets is indefinite as to timing and amount 
our ffo measures are limited in that they do not reflect the current period changes in these net assets that result from periodic foreign currency exchange rate movements 
the impairment charges of goodwill and other assets that we exclude from core ffo  have been or may be realized as a loss in the future upon the ultimate disposition of the related investments or other assets through the form of lower cash proceeds 
the gains and losses on extinguishment of debt that we exclude from our core ffo  may provide a benefit or cost to us as we may be settling our debt at less or more than our future obligation 
the merger  acquisition and other integration expenses and the natural disaster expenses that we exclude from core ffo are costs that we have incurred 
we compensate for these limitations by using our ffo measures only in conjunction with net earnings computed under gaap when making our decisions 
to assist investors in compensating for these limitations  we reconcile our defined ffo measures to our net earnings computed under gaap 
this information should be read with our complete financial statements prepared under gaap

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign exchange related variability and earnings volatility on our foreign investments

we have also used interest rate swap agreements to reduce our interest rate market risk 
we do not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and all financial instruments are entered into in accordance with established policies and procedures 
we monitor our market risk exposures using a sensitivity analysis 
our sensitivity analysis estimates the exposure to market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical adverse change in year end interest rates 
the results of the sensitivity analysis are summarized below 
the sensitivity analysis is of limited predictive value 
as a result  our ultimate realized gains or losses with respect to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during a future period  hedging strategies at the time and the prevailing interest and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of future interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows 
to achieve this objective  we primarily borrow on a fixed rate basis for longer term debt issuances 
at december   we have billion million in tmk bond agreements and a billion million term loan with variable interest rates 
we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to fix the interest rate on billion million as of december  of the tmk bonds and the entire term loan for the term of the agreements 
at december   we have also entered into interest rate swap agreements to fix the interest rate on million billion of secured debt  of which million million relates to pepr  with variable interest rates 
in  we had weighted average daily outstanding borrowings of million on our variable rate credit facilities 
based on the results of the sensitivity analysis  which assumed a adverse change in interest rates  the estimated market risk exposure for the variable rate lines of credit was approximately million of cash flow in 
table of contents foreign currency risk foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange rates relates to the translation of the net income and financial position of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars  principally euro  british pound sterling and yen 
to mitigate our foreign currency exchange exposure  we borrow in the functional currency of the borrowing entity  when appropriate 
we also may use foreign currency put option contracts to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the projected net operating income of our foreign consolidated subsidiaries and unconsolidated investees 
at december   we had no put option contracts outstanding and  therefore  we may experience fluctuations in our earnings as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we also have some exposure to movements in exchange rates related to certain intercompany loans we issue from time to time and we may use foreign currency forward contracts to manage these risks 
at december   we had no forward contracts outstanding and  therefore  we may experience fluctuations in our earnings from the remeasurement of these intercompany loans due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates
