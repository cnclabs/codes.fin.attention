table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leader in the discovery and development of innovative antibody based therapeutics 
our lead drug candidate is gevokizumab formerly xoma  a humanized antibody that binds to the inflammatory cytokine interleukin beta il beta 
in collaboration with our partner  les laboratoires servier servier  gevokizumab is expected to enter global phase clinical development in for non infectious uveitis niu and beh et s uveitis 
we anticipate servier will enter gevokizumab into a phase study in a cardiovascular disease indication during separately we have launched a phase proof of concept program for gevokizumab to evaluate additional indications for further development  including a clinical trial in moderate to severe inflammatory acne  which began enrolling patients in december  and a clinical trial in erosive osteoarthritis of the hand  for which we plan to initiate enrollment in the second quarter of we have entered into a license and collaboration agreement with servier to jointly develop and commercialize gevokizumab in multiple indications 
gevokizumab is designed to inhibit the pro inflammatory cytokine il beta  which is believed to be a primary trigger of pathologic inflammation in multiple diseases 
our proprietary preclinical pipeline includes classes of antibodies that activate or sensitize the insulin receptor in vivo and represent potential new therapeutic approaches to the treatment of diabetes 
we have developed these and other antibodies using some or all of our adapt antibody discovery and development platform  our modulx technologies for generating allosterically modulating antibodies  and our optimx technologies for optimizing biophysical properties of antibodies  including affinity  immunogenicity  stability and manufacturability 
in january  we announced that we had acquired us rights to the perindopril franchise from servier 
the agreement includes aceon perindopril erbumine  a currently marketed angiotensin converting enzyme ace inhibitor  and a portfolio of three fixed dose combination product candidates where perindopril is combined with another active ingredient s  such as a calcium channel blocker 
the proprietary form of perindopril in each of the combination product candidates provides patent protection until december we assumed commercialization activities for aceon in january following the transfer from servier s previous licensee 
in late february  we initiated enrollment in a phase trial for perindopril arginine and amlodipine besylate  the first fixed dose combination product candidate from the perindopril franchise we acquired from servier 
partial funding for the phase trial will be provided by servier  the balance of study expenses  consisting primarily of costs generated by our contract research organization  are expected to be paid by us over time from any profits generated by our aceon sales 
our biodefense initiatives currently include a million multiple year contract funded by the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid  a part of the national institutes of health nih  to support our ongoing development of anti botulism antibody product candidates  of which the first  xoma ab  is in a phase clinical trial 
this contract is the third that niaid has awarded us for the development of botulinum antitoxins 
in october  we announced that we had been awarded a fourth contract for up to million over five years to develop broad spectrum antitoxins for the treatment of human botulism poisoning  bringing the program s total potential awards to approximately million 
in january  we announced that we will complete niaid biodefense contracts currently in place but will not actively pursue future contracts 
should the government choose to acquire xoma ab or other biodefense products in the future  we expect to be able to provide these antibodies through an outside manufacturer 
we also have developed antibody product candidates with premier pharmaceutical companies including novartis ag novartis and takeda pharmaceutical company limited takeda 
two antibodies developed with novartis  lfa and hcd lucatumumab  are in phase and or clinical development by novartis for the potential treatment of breast or prostate cancer and hematological malignancies  respectively 
significant developments in gevokizumab in december  we entered into an agreement with servier to jointly develop and commercialize gevokizumab in multiple indications  which provided for a non refundable upfront payment of million that we received in january in connection with this agreement  servier will fully fund the first million of future gevokizumab global clinical development and chemistry and manufacturing controls cmc expenses  and of further expenses for the beh et s uveitis indication 
servier has agreed to include the niu phase trial discussed below under the terms of the collaboration agreement for beh et s uveitis discussed above so long as the european medicines agency enables the results of the trial to be included in regulatory submissions in the eu 
based upon the timing of anticipated regulatory interactions  we anticipate initiating the niu phase trial in the second quarter of 
table of contents in january  we received the full million advance allowed under our loan agreement with servier dated december   converting to us dollar proceeds of approximately million 
in march  we announced that our phase b trial of gevokizumab in type diabetes in patients did not achieve the primary endpoint of reduction in hemoglobin ac hbac after six monthly treatments with gevokizumab compared to placebo 
significant decreases were observed in c reactive protein crp  a biomarker for the risk of heart attack  stroke and other cardiovascular diseases  in all dose groups versus placebo 
in addition  significant improvements in high density lipoprotein hdl  or good cholesterol  were observed in two of four gevokizumab dose groups versus placebo 
gevokizumab was well tolerated in this trial  with no significant differences in adverse events between gevokizumab and placebo and no serious drug related adverse events 
in june  we announced top line trial results from our six month phase a trial in patients where gevokizumab was shown to be well tolerated with no significant differences in adverse events between gevokizumab and placebo and no serious drug related adverse events 
evidence of biological activity was observed including a reduction in crp 
there were no differences in glycemic control between the drug and placebo groups as measured by hbac levels 
in november  we announced an expansion of our gevokizumab program together with our collaboration partner servier 
the expanded plan includes a global phase trial in niu involving the intermediate and or posterior segments of the eye  including beh et s uveitis and a phase trial outside the us in beh et s uveitis 
in december  we initiated a phase proof of concept study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of gevokizumab for the treatment of inflammatory lesions seen in moderate to severe inflammatory acne vulgaris 
approximately patients will be randomized to receive one or two dose levels of gevokizumab or placebo over a three month period 
dosing in patients began in december xmet activating and sensitizing antibodies in june  we announced our discovery of two new classes of fully human monoclonal antibodies  xmeta and xmets  which activate or sensitize the insulin receptor in vivo  each representing a distinct new therapeutic approach to the treatment of patients with diabetes 
studies of xmeta demonstrated that it reduced fasting blood glucose levels and improved glucose tolerance in a mouse model of diabetes 
after six weeks of treatment  there was a statistically significant reduction in hbac levels  a standard measure of average blood glucose levels over time  in mice treated with xmeta compared to a control group  and there was a statistically significant reduction in elevated non hdl cholesterol levels 
studies of xmets showed enhanced insulin sensitivity and statistically significant improvements in fasting blood glucose levels and glucose tolerance in mice treated with xmets as compared to a control group  and there was a statistically significant reduction in elevated non hdl cholesterol levels 
these data were presented at the american diabetes association s st scientific sessions 
xoma ab in may  the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid  part of the national institutes of health nih  informed us that it is initiating a phase trial of xoma ab  a novel formulation of three antibodies designed to prevent and treat botulism poisoning 
this double blind  dose escalation study in approximately healthy volunteers is designed to assess the safety and tolerability  and determine the pharmacokinetic profile  of xoma ab 
in october  we announced that niaid had awarded us a new contract under contract no 
hhsnc for up to million over years to develop broad spectrum antitoxins for the treatment of human botulism poisoning 
management change on august   we announced that steven b 
engle resigned as chief executive officer  president and chairman of the board of the company 
on january   the company s board of directors appointed john varian  a current board member  as chief executive officer after serving as interim chief executive officer for five months 
w 
denman van ness will continue to serve as chairman of the board 

table of contents financing related in  we sold  shares of our common stock through wm smith co 
wm smith and mcnicoll  lewis vlak llc now known as mlv co 
llc  mlv under our at market issuance sales agreement dated october  the atm agreement  for aggregate gross proceeds of million  and  shares of our common stock through mlv under our at market issuance sales agreement dated february  the atm agreement  for aggregate gross proceeds of million 
in april  the  series b convertible preference shares previously issued to genentech  inc were converted by genentech into  shares of our common stock  and the associated liquidation preference of million was eliminated 
in may  we entered into two foreign exchange options contracts in order to manage our foreign currency exposure relating to principal and interest payments on our million loan from servier 
upfront premiums paid on these contracts totaled million 
in december  we entered into a loan agreement the loan agreement with general electric capital corporation gecc under which gecc agreed to make  and made  a term loan of million 
this loan accrues interest at a fixed rate of per annum and is secured by substantially all of our existing and after acquired assets  excluding our intellectual property assets 
we are required to repay the principal amount over a period of consecutive equal monthly installments of principal and accrued interest 
the loan matures on june   at which time we will make an additional payment equal to of the loan 
we also issued to gecc unregistered stock purchase warrants  which entitle gecc to purchase up to an aggregate of  unregistered shares of xoma common stock at an exercise price equal to per share 
these warrants are immediately exercisable and expire on december  other effective december   we changed our jurisdiction of incorporation from bermuda to delaware and changed our name from xoma ltd 
to xoma corporation 
all outstanding common shares of the former xoma ltd 
automatically converted into xoma corporation common stock on a one for one basis 
critical accounting estimates the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and the related disclosures  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following policies to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations because they require us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition in march  accounting standards codification topic  revenue recognition was amended to define a milestone and clarify that the milestone method of revenue recognition is a valid application of the proportional performance model when applied to research or development arrangements 
accordingly  a company can make an accounting policy election to recognize a payment that is contingent upon the achievement of a substantive milestone in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved 
this guidance was adopted effective january  on a prospective basis and did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
license and collaborative fees revenue from non refundable license  technology access or other payments under license and collaborative agreements where we have a continuing obligation to perform is recognized as revenue over the expected period of the continuing performance obligation 
we estimate the performance period at the inception of the arrangement and re evaluate it each reporting period 
this re evaluation may shorten or lengthen the period over which the remaining revenue is recognized 
changes to these estimates are recorded on a prospective basis 

table of contents milestone payments under collaborative and other arrangements are recognized as revenue upon completion of the milestone event  once confirmation is received from the third party and collectability is reasonably assured 
this represents the culmination of the earnings process because we have no future performance obligations related to the payment 
milestone payments that require a continuing performance obligation on our part are recognized over the expected period of the continuing performance obligation 
amounts received in advance are recorded as deferred revenue until the related milestone is completed 
contract revenue contract revenue for research and development involves our providing research and development and manufacturing services to collaborative partners  biodefense contractors or others 
revenue for certain contracts is accounted for by a proportional performance  or output based  method where performance is based on estimated progress toward elements defined in the contract 
the amount of contract revenue and related costs recognized in each accounting period are based on estimates of the proportional performance during the period 
adjustments to estimates based on actual performance are recognized on a prospective basis and do not result in reversal of revenue should the estimate to complete be extended 
in addition  revenue related to certain research and development contracts is billed based on actual costs incurred by xoma related to the contract  multiplied by full time equivalent fte rates plus a mark up 
the fte rates are developed based on our best estimates of labor  materials and overhead costs 
for certain contracts  such as our government contracts  the fte rates are agreed upon at the beginning of the contract and are subject to review or audit by the contracting party at any time 
under our contracts with niaid  a part of the nih  we bill using nih provisional rates and thus are subject to future audits at the discretion of niaid s contracting office 
these audits can result in an adjustment to revenue previously reported 
in  the nih conducted an audit of our actual data for period from january  through december  and developed final billing rates for this period 
as a result  we retroactively applied these nih rates to the invoices from this period resulting in an increase in revenue of million from the nih  excluding million billed to the nih in resulting from our performance of a comparison of calculated costs incurred and costs billed to the government under provisional rates 
final rates will be settled through negotiations with the nih 
this revenue has been deferred and will be recognized upon completion of negotiations with and approval by the nih 
upfront fees are recognized ratably over the expected benefit period under the arrangement 
given the uncertainties of research and development collaborations  significant judgment is required to determine the duration of the arrangement 
we have million of deferred up front fees related to one research and collaboration agreement that is being amortized over one year 
stock based compensation the valuation of stock based compensation awards is determined at the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model the black scholes model 
this model requires inputs such as the expected term of the option  expected volatility and risk free interest rate 
further  the forfeiture rate also impacts the amount of aggregate compensation 
these inputs are subjective and generally require significant analysis and judgment to develop 
to establish an estimate of expected term  we consider the vesting period and contractual period of the award and our historical experience of stock option exercises  post vesting cancellations and volatility 
to establish an estimate of forfeiture rate  we consider our historical experience of option forfeitures and terminations 
the risk free rate is based on the yield available on united states treasury zero coupon issues 
we review our valuation assumptions quarterly and  as a result  it is likely we will change our valuation assumptions used to value stock based awards granted in future periods 
stock based compensation expense is recognized ratably over the requisite service period 
income taxes the application of income tax law and regulations is inherently complex 
interpretations and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time 
as such  changes in our subjective assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in our financial statements 
we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with accounting standards codification topic  income taxes asc 
asc provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not 
based upon the weight of available evidence  which includes our historical operating performance and carry back potential  we have determined that total deferred tax assets should be fully offset by a valuation allowance 

table of contents warrants we have issued warrants to purchase shares of our common stock in connection with financing activities 
we account for some of these warrants as a liability at fair value and others as equity at fair value 
the fair value of the outstanding warrants is estimated using the black scholes model 
the black scholes model requires inputs such as the expected term of the warrants  share price volatility and risk free interest rate 
these inputs are subjective and generally require significant analysis and judgment to develop 
for the estimate of the expected term  we use the full remaining contractual term of the warrant 
we base our estimate of expected volatility on our historical volatility 
the assumptions associated with warrant liabilities are reviewed each reporting period and changes in the estimated fair value of these warrant liabilities are recognized in other income expense 
results of operations revenue total revenue in was million  compared with million in and million in as shown in the table below in thousands year ended december  license and collaborative fees contract and other revenue royalties total revenues license and collaborative fees license and collaborative fee revenue includes fees and milestone payments related to the out licensing of our products and technologies 
license and collaborative fee revenue in was million  compared with million in and million in the primary components of license and collaboration fee revenue in were million in revenue recognized related to the collaboration and loan agreements with servier to jointly develop and commercialize gevokizumab in multiple indications 
in addition  we recognized two milestone payments for an aggregate amount of million and million in up front fees and annual maintenance fees relating to various out licensing arrangements 
the primary components of license and collaboration fee revenue in were four milestone payments recognized for an aggregate amount of million  including one milestone from aveo pharmaceuticals  inc aveo for million resulting from aveo s initiation of a phase clinical trial to evaluate its av antibody 
in addition  we recognized million in up front fees and annual maintenance fees relating to various out licensing arrangements 
the primary components of license and collaborative fee revenue in were million in revenue recognized related to the expansion of our collaboration agreement with takeda in february and million in total revenue  including ancillary services provided  related to two antibody discovery collaboration agreements entered into with arana therapeutics limited arana and the chemo sero therapeutic research institute  a japanese research foundation known as kaketsuken in september and october we also recognized million of license and collaborative fee revenue in related to up front fees  annual maintenance fees and milestone payments from various out licensing arrangements 
the generation of future revenue related to license fees and collaborative arrangements is dependent on our ability to attract new licensees to our antibody and bce technologies and new collaboration partners 
we expect license and collaboration fee revenue to decrease in compared to levels 

table of contents contract and other revenue contract and other revenue includes agreements where we provide contracted research and development services to our collaboration partners  including servier and niaid 
the following table shows the activity in contract and other revenue for the years ended december    and in thousands year ended december  increase increase decrease decrease servier niaid takeda sri international merck schering plough novartis other total revenues the increase in contract revenue was primarily due to gevokizumab clinical development and cmc activity under the collaboration with servier 
partially offsetting this increase were decreases in revenue from our niaid contract no 
hhsnc niaid due to decreased activity under the contract  our takeda contracts as a result of the cessation of certain takeda programs in  and our sri international subcontract awards due to the successful completion of the services we had agreed to perform in the increase in contract revenue was primarily due to increased activity under our niaid and sri international contracts 
partially offsetting these increases are decreases in revenue from our schering plough research institute  a division of schering corporation  now a subsidiary of merck co  inc referred to herein as merck schering plough and takeda contracts as a result of the cessation of certain merck schering plough programs in and certain takeda programs in both and also  the decrease in revenue from our manufacturing and technology transfer agreement with novartis was due to the completion of the work under this agreement in the third quarter of based on expected levels of revenue generating activity related to our servier and niaid contracts  we expect contract and other revenue to decrease in compared to levels 
the following table shows the activity in deferred revenue for the years ended december   and in thousands year ended december  beginning deferred revenue revenue deferred revenue recognized ending deferred revenue we defer revenue until all requirements under our revenue recognition policy are met 
in  we deferred revenue from contracts including servier  nih and takeda 
in  we deferred revenue from contracts including servier  nih  takeda  merck schering plough and aveo 
in  we deferred revenue from contracts including takeda  merck schering plough and novartis 
we expect a significant portion of the million in deferred revenue will be recognized in with the remainder to be earned during through future amounts may be affected by additional consideration received  if any  under existing or any future licensing or other collaborative arrangements as well as changes in the estimated period of obligation or services to be provided under the arrangements 
royalties revenue from royalties was million in compared with million in and million in the decrease in royalties in was primarily due to the sale of our cimzia royalty interest for net proceeds of million in the third quarter of royalties earned from sales of cimzia were million in  compared with million in we will not receive any further royalties on sales of cimzia 
the decrease in royalties in was primarily due to the sale  during  of our lucentis royalty interest to genentech for net proceeds of million in september additionally  the cessation of royalties earned from sales of raptiva in the second quarter of further contributed to the decrease in our revenue from royalties 
royalties earned from sales of lucentis and raptiva during were million and million  respectively 
we will not receive any further royalties on sales of lucentis or raptiva 
partially offsetting the decreases in revenue from royalties in was the sale of our cimzia royalty interest in the third quarter of 
table of contents research and development expenses biopharmaceutical development includes a series of steps  including in vitro and in vivo preclinical testing  and phase  and clinical studies in humans 
each of these steps is typically more expensive than the previous step  but actual timing and the cost to us depends on the product being tested  the nature of the potential disease indication and the terms of any collaborative arrangements with other companies 
after successful conclusion of all of these steps  regulatory filings for approval to market the products must be completed  including approval of manufacturing processes and facilities for the product 
our research and development expenses currently include costs of personnel  supplies  facilities and equipment  consultants  third party costs and other expenses related to preclinical and clinical testing 
research and development expenses were million in  compared with million in and million in the decrease in research and development expenses of million in  as compared to  was primarily due to decreased spending on gevokizumab related clinical trials 
the increase in research and development expenses of million in  as compared to  was primarily due to increased spending on gevokizumab related to the phase clinical program and spending on niaid due to increased activity under the contract 
partially offsetting these increases in spending were decreases in spending on merck schering plough and takeda related contract activities due to the cessation of certain discovery and development programs 
in addition  there was decreased spending on novartis related contract activities due to the completion of work under agreement in the third quarter of research and development expense in primarily reflects spending on development of gevokizumab  including phase and phase clinical trials  and spending on preclinical antibody discovery programs in several indications  and on our contracts with niaid  takeda and sri international 
salaries and related personnel costs are a significant component of research and development expenses 
we recorded million in research and development salaries and employee related expenses in  compared with million in and million in included in these expenses for were million for salaries and benefits  million for bonus expense and million for stock based compensation  which is a non cash expense 
the increase of million in  as compared to  was primarily due to personnel related costs in connection with increased gevokizumab clinical development and cmc activity under the collaboration with servier 
included in these expenses for were million for salaries and benefits  million for bonus expense and million for stock based compensation  which is a non cash expense  compared with million  million and million  respectively  in the million increase in salaries and employee related expenses in  as compared to  was primarily due to higher salaries and related personnel costs in connection with increased manufacturing activities and work related to niaid our research and development activities can be divided into earlier stage programs and later stage programs 
earlier stage programs include molecular biology  process development  pilot scale production and preclinical testing 
also included in earlier stage programs are costs related to excess manufacturing capacity  which we expect will decrease in due to our streamlining objectives to utilize a contract manufacturing organization 
later stage programs include clinical testing  regulatory affairs and manufacturing clinical supplies 
certain research and development segment reclassifications have been made to previously reported amounts to conform to the current year s presentation 
the costs associated with these programs approximate the following in thousands year ended december  earlier stage programs later stage programs total 
table of contents our research and development activities can also be divided into those related to our internal projects and those projects related to collaborative and contract arrangements 
certain research and development segment reclassifications have been made to previously reported amounts to conform to the current year s presentation 
the costs related to internal projects versus collaborative and contract arrangements approximate the following in thousands year ended december  internal projects collaborative and contract arrangements total in  each of the two programs upon which we incurred the largest amount of expense gevokizumab and niaid accounted for more than but less than of our total research and development expense and one development program xmet accounted for more than but less than of our total research and development expense 
in  our largest development program gevokizumab accounted for more than but less than of our total research and development expense and one development program niaid accounted for more than but less than of our total research and development expense 
in  one development program gevokizumab accounted for more than but less than of our total research and development expense and one development program niaid accounted for more than but less than of our total research and development expense 
all remaining development programs accounted for less than of our total research and development expense in   and we expect our research and development spending in will increase primarily due to the expected initiation of our phase clinical program for gevokizumab for niu indication  the initiation of our phase proof of concept program for gevokizumab to evaluate moderate to severe inflammatory acne and the expected initiation of our phase proof of concept program for erosive osteoarthritis of the hand  all under our license and collaboration agreement with servier 
in addition  we plan to announce the final proof of concept indication later in also contributing to the increase is the initiation of a phase trial for perindopril arginine in combination with amlodipine besylate 
future research and development spending may also be impacted by potential new licensing or collaboration arrangements  as well as the termination of existing agreements 
beyond this  the scope and magnitude of future research and development expenses are difficult to predict at this time 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses include salaries and related personnel costs  facilities costs and professional fees 
in  selling  general and administrative expenses were million compared with million in and million in the million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in as compared with was primarily due an increase in salaries and related personnel costs of million primarily due to a one time accrued million severance expense and a million stock based compensation charge incurred during the third quarter of in connection with the resignation of our chairman  chief executive officer and president and an increase in other stock based compensation of million 
partially offsetting this increase were decreases in financing fees and legal fees of million and million  respectively 
the million decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses in as compared with was primarily due a net decrease in financing and professional fees of million  as well as a decrease in salaries and related personnel costs of million 
partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in other expenses of million  including an increase in travel related costs 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses in will decrease approximately to compared to levels due to decreased salaries and employee related expenses 
restructuring charges in january  we implemented a restructuring designed to sharpen our focus on value creating opportunities led by gevokizumab and our unique antibody discovery and development capabilities 
the restructuring plan includes a reduction of our personnel by positions  or  of which approximately were eliminated immediately and the remainder will be eliminated by april  see subsequent events below for further discussion of our january restructuring 
in january  we announced a workforce reduction of approximately 
as part of this workforce reduction  we recorded charges of million during related to severance  other termination benefits and outplacement services  which were fully paid by the end of there were no additional employee related restructuring charges in connection with this workforce reduction 
as a result of the workforce reduction  in the second quarter of  we vacated one of our leased buildings and recorded a restructuring charge of million primarily related to the net present value of the net future minimum lease payments at the cease use date  less the estimated future sublease income 
effective december  we entered into a sublease agreement for this building 
the remaining liability related to this lease was million and million at december  and  respectively

we also recognized million of income tax benefit for relating to research and development refundable credits 
accounting standards codification topic  income taxes asc provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not 
based upon the weight of available evidence  which includes our historical operating performance and carry back potential  we have determined that total deferred tax assets should be fully offset by a valuation allowance 
we have recorded cumulative gross deferred tax assets of million and million at december  and  respectively  principally attributable to the timing of the deduction of certain expenses associated with certain research and development expenses  net operating loss and other carry forwards 
we also recorded corresponding valuation allowances of million and million at december  and  respectively  to offset these deferred tax assets  as management cannot predict with reasonable certainty that the deferred tax assets to which the valuation allowances relate will be realized 
as of december   we had federal net operating loss carry forwards nols of approximately million and state net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million to offset future taxable income 
we also had federal research and development tax credit carry forwards of approximately million and state research and development tax credit carry forwards of approximately million 
based on our initial analysis under section of the internal revenue code which subjects the amount of pre change nols and certain other pre change tax attributes that can be utilized to an annual limitation  we experienced an ownership change in  which would substantially limit the future use of our pre change nols and certain other pre change tax attributes per year 
we have and will continue to evaluate alternative analyses permitted under section and irs notices in order to determine whether or not any ownership changes have occurred and may occur and if so  when they occurred that would result in limitations on our nols or certain other tax attributes 
to the extent that we do not utilize our carry forwards within the applicable statutory carry forward periods  either because of section limitations or the lack of sufficient taxable income  the carry forwards will expire unused 
we did not have unrecognized tax benefits as of december  and do not expect this to change significantly over the next twelve months 
in accordance with asc  we will recognize interest and penalties accrued on any unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense 
as of december   we have not accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions

servier loan in december  we entered into a loan agreement with servier  which provided for an advance of up to million 
the loan was fully funded in january  with the proceeds converting to approximately million 
the loan is secured by an interest in xoma s intellectual property rights to all gevokizumab indications worldwide  excluding certain rights in the us and japan

the term loan matures and is due and payable in full on june   at which time we will make an additional payment equal to of the term loan 

table of contents in december  pursuant to the loan agreement  we issued to gecc unregistered stock purchase warrants  which entitle gecc to purchase up to an aggregate of  unregistered shares of xoma common stock at an exercise price equal to per share 
these warrants are immediately exercisable and expire on december  proceeds from the sale of shares under the purchase agreement  the purchase agreement  the atm agreement  the atm agreement  the atm agreement  the servier loan  the gecc term loan  registered direct offerings and other equity offerings are being used to continue development of our gevokizumab product candidate and for other working capital and general corporate purposes 
we also used certain of these proceeds to repay the goldman sachs term loan in september we have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
during  we expect to continue using our cash and cash equivalents to fund ongoing operations 
additional licensing  antibody discovery and development collaboration agreements  government funding and financing arrangements may positively impact our cash balances 
based on our cash reserves and anticipated spending levels  revenue from collaborations including the gevokizumab license and collaboration agreement with servier  funding from the loan agreement with gecc  our recent public offering  biodefense contracts and licensing transactions and other sources of funding that we believe to be available  we estimate that we have sufficient cash resources to meet our anticipated net cash needs into any significant revenue shortfalls  increases in planned spending on development programs or more rapid progress of development programs than anticipated  as well as the unavailability of anticipated sources of funding  could shorten this period 
if adequate funds are not available  we will be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our product development programs and further reduce personnel related costs 
progress or setbacks by potentially competing products may also affect our ability to raise new funding on acceptable terms 
commitments and contingencies schedule of contractual obligations payments by period due under contractual obligations at december  are as follows in thousands contractual obligations total less than year to years to years more than years operating leases a debt obligations b principal interest total a operating leases are net of sublease income of million 
b see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note long term debt and other arrangements to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt obligation 
in addition to the above  we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of licensing and development programs 
payments under these agreements become due and payable only upon the achievement of certain developmental  regulatory and or commercial milestones 
because it is uncertain if and when these milestones will be achieved  such contingencies  aggregating up to million assuming one product per contract meets all milestones have not been recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
we are also obligated to pay royalties  ranging generally from to of the selling price of the licensed component and up to of any sublicense fees to various universities and other research institutions based on future sales or licensing of products that incorporate certain products and technologies developed by those institutions 
we are unable to determine precisely when and if our payment obligations under the agreements will become due as these obligations are based on future events  the achievement of which is subject to a significant number of risks and uncertainties 
although operations are influenced by general economic conditions  we do not believe that inflation had a material impact on financial results for the periods presented 
we believe that we are not dependent on materials or other resources that would be significantly impacted by inflation or changing economic conditions in the foreseeable future 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in march  accounting standards codification topic  revenue recognition was amended to define a milestone and clarify that the milestone method of revenue recognition is a valid application of the proportional performance model when applied to research or development arrangements 
accordingly  a company can make an accounting policy election to recognize a payment that is contingent upon the achievement of a substantive milestone in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved 
this guidance was adopted effective january  on a prospective basis and did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in may  accounting standards codification topic  fair value measurement was amended to develop common requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and international financial reporting standards 
the company plans to adopt this guidance as of january  on a prospective basis and does not expect the adoption thereof to have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in june  accounting standards codification topic  comprehensive income was amended to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income 
accordingly  a company can present all nonowner changes in stockholders equity either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the company plans to adopt this guidance as of january  on a retrospective basis and does not expect the adoption thereof to have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
subsequent events restructuring in january  we implemented a restructuring designed to sharpen our focus on value creating opportunities led by gevokizumab and our unique antibody discovery and development capabilities 
the restructuring plan includes a reduction of our personnel by positions  or  of which approximately were eliminated immediately and the remainder will be eliminated by april  as a result  we expect to reduce ongoing internal spending by approximately million in compared to the level 
we also anticipate taking one time charges for restructuring and related severance costs totaling approximately million during  of which million are expected to result in cash charges and million are expected to be taken in the first quarter of these staff reductions result primarily from our decisions to utilize a contract manufacturing organization for phase and commercial antibody production and to eliminate internal research functions that are non differentiating or that can be obtained cost effectively by contract service providers 
acquisition of us rights to perindopril franchise on january   we announced that we had acquired us rights to the perindopril franchise from servier 
the agreement includes aceon perindopril erbumine  a currently marketed angiotensin converting enzyme ace inhibitor  and a portfolio of three fixed dose combination product candidates where perindopril is combined with another active ingredient s  such as a calcium channel blocker 
we assumed commercialization activities for aceon in january following the transfer from servier s previous licensee 
in late february  we initiated enrollment in a phase trial for perindopril arginine and amlodipine besylate  the first fixed dose combination product candidate 
the trial  named path perindopril amlodipine for the treatment of hypertension  is expected to enroll approximately patients with hypertension to determine the safety and efficacy of the fixed dose combination versus either perindopril or amlodipine alone 
based on regulatory interaction to date  if positive  this trial is expected to be the only additional efficacy trial needed to complement the existing clinical data in support of the submission of an application to the fda seeking approval for this product candidate 
we estimate the total cost of the path trial will be between million and million 
partial funding for the path trial will be provided by servier  the balance of study expenses  consisting primarily of costs generated by medpace  inc  our contract research organization  are expected to be paid over time from the profits generated by our aceon sales 
underwritten offering and amendment to shareholder rights plan on march   we completed an underwritten public offering of  shares of our common stock  and accompanying warrants to purchase one half of a share of common stock for each share purchased  at a public offering price of per share 
total gross proceeds from the offering were approximately million  before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses totaling approximately million 
the warrants  which represent the right to acquire an aggregate of up to  shares of common stock  are immediately exercisable and have a five year term and an exercise price of per share 

table of contents we have amended our shareholder rights agreement to provide that it will not apply to any person or entity who becomes the beneficial owner of or more but less than of our outstanding common stock with the prior approval of our board of directors  and our board has approved purchasers in the recent public offering becoming beneficial owners of or more but less than of our outstanding common stock as a result of their participation in the offering 
as a result  such ownership by any such purchaser will not trigger the provisions of the rights agreement that would give each holder of the rights the right to receive upon exercise that number of common share equivalents having a market value of two times the exercise price 
the board s approval in this regard only applies to purchasers in such offering

actual results could differ materially from those anticipated due to certain risks inherent in the biotechnology industry and for companies engaged in the development of new products in a regulated market 
among other things  clinical trials may not reach their anticipated size if trials are not initiated or due to enrollment issues such as unavailability of patients  competing product candidates or unanticipated safety issues  the timing of initiation of or availability of results of clinical trials may be delayed or may never occur as a result of actions or inaction by regulators or our present or future collaboration partners  complications in the design  implementation or third party approval of clinical trials  complications in the collection or interpretation of statistical data or unanticipated safety issues  the period for which our cash resources are sufficient could be shortened if expenditures are made earlier or in larger amounts than anticipated or are unanticipated  if anticipated revenue or cost sharing arrangements do not materialize  or if funds are not otherwise available on acceptable terms  and our revenues may be lower than anticipated  and our costs including clinical trial costs may be higher than expected  due to actions or inactions by regulatory authorities or our present or future collaboration partners  unanticipated safety issues or unavailability of additional financing  licensing or collaboration opportunities

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our loan facilities 
by policy  we make our investments in high quality debt securities  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and limit duration by restricting the term of the instrument 
we generally hold investments to maturity  with a weighted average portfolio period of less than twelve months 
however  if the need arose to liquidate such securities before maturity  we may experience losses on liquidation 
we hold interest bearing instruments that are classified as cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
fluctuations in interest rates can affect the principal values and yields of fixed income investments 
if interest rates in the general economy were to rise rapidly in a short period of time  our fixed income investments could lose value 

table of contents the following table presents the amounts and related weighted average interest rates of our cash and investments at december  and in thousands  except interest rate maturity carrying amount in thousands fair value in thousands weighted average interest rate december  cash and cash equivalents daily to days december  cash and cash equivalents daily to days as of december   we have an outstanding principal balance on our note with novartis of million  which is due in the interest rate on this note is charged at a rate of usd six month libor plus  which was at december  no further borrowing is available under this note 
as of december   we have an outstanding principal balance on our loan with servier of million  which converts to approximately million at december  the interest rate on this loan is charged at a floating rate based on a euro inter bank offered rate euribor and subject to a cap 
the interest rate for the initial interest period was 
the interest rate has been reset to for six month period from july through january and for the six month period from january through july no further borrowing is available under this loan 
as of december   we have an outstanding principal balance on our loan with gecc of million  which is to be repaid over a period of consecutive equal monthly installments 
the loan accrues interest at a fixed rate of per annum 
no further borrowing is available under this note 
the variable interest rate related to our long term debt instruments is based on libor for our novartis note and euribor for our servier loan 
we estimate that a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates could increase or decrease our interest expense by approximately million on an annualized basis 
our loan with gecc is not subject to interest rate risk as it accrues interest at a fixed rate 
foreign currency risk we hold debt  may incur expenses  and may be owed milestones denominated in foreign currencies 
the amount of debt owed  expenses incurred  or milestones owed to us will be impacted by fluctuations in these foreign currencies 
when the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the us dollar value of the foreign currency denominated debt  expense  and milestones increases  and when the us dollar strengthens against these currencies  the us dollar value of the foreign currency denominated debt  expense  and milestones decreases 
consequently  changes in exchange rates will affect the amount we are required to repay on our million loan from servier and may affect our results of operations 
our loan from servier was fully funded in january  with the proceeds converting to approximately million using the january  euro to usd exchange rate 
at december   the million outstanding principal balance under this loan agreement would have equaled approximately million using the december  euro to usd exchange rate 
in may  in order to manage our foreign currency exposure relating to our principal and interest payments on our loan from servier  we entered into two foreign exchange option contracts 
our use of derivative financial instruments represents risk management  we do not enter into derivative financial contracts for trading purposes
