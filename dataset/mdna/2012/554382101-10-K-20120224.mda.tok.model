the center will be a fully enclosed two level   square foot outlet center 
the site is located within a mile of o hare international airport 
the project broke ground in november  and is expected to be completed in summer the total estimated project cost is approximately million 
inflation in the last five years  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company because of a relatively low inflation rate 
most of the leases at the centers have rent adjustments periodically throughout the lease term 
these rent increases are either in fixed increments or based on using an annual multiple of increases in the consumer price index cpi 
in addition  approximately to of the leases expire each year  which enables the company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base rents if the rents of the existing leases are below the then existing market rate 
the company has generally entered into leases that require tenants to pay a stated amount for operating expenses  generally excluding property taxes  regardless of the expenses actually incurred at any center  which places the burden of cost control on the company 
additionally  certain leases require the tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses 
seasonality the shopping center industry is seasonal in nature  particularly in the fourth quarter during the holiday season when retailer occupancy and retail sales are typically at their highest levels 
in addition  shopping malls achieve a substantial portion of their specialty temporary retailer rents during the holiday season and the majority of percentage rent is recognized in the fourth quarter 
as a result of the above  earnings are generally higher in the fourth quarter 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 

table of contents some of these estimates and assumptions include judgments on revenue recognition  estimates for common area maintenance and real estate tax accruals  provisions for uncollectible accounts  impairment of long lived assets  the allocation of purchase price between tangible and intangible assets  and estimates for environmental matters 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in more detail in note summary of significant accounting policies in the company s notes to the consolidated financial statements 
however  the following policies are deemed to be critical 
revenue recognition minimum rental revenues are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the related lease 
the difference between the amount of rent due in a year and the amount recorded as rental income is referred to as the straight line rent adjustment 
currently  of the mall store and freestanding store leases contain provisions for cpi rent increases periodically throughout the term of the lease 
the company believes that using an annual multiple of cpi increases  rather than fixed contractual rent increases  results in revenue recognition that more closely matches the cash revenue from each lease and will provide more consistent rent growth throughout the term of the leases 
percentage rents are recognized when the tenants specified sales targets have been met 
estimated recoveries from certain tenants for their pro rata share of real estate taxes  insurance and other shopping center operating expenses are recognized as revenues in the period the applicable expenses are incurred 
other tenants pay a fixed rate and these tenant recoveries revenues are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the related leases 
property the company capitalizes costs incurred in redevelopment and development of properties 
the costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs 
the capitalized costs include pre construction costs essential to the development of the property  development costs  construction costs  interest costs  real estate taxes  salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development 
capitalized costs are allocated to the specific components of a project that are benefited 
the company considers a construction project as completed and held available for occupancy and ceases capitalization of costs when the areas under development have been substantially completed 
maintenance and repair expenses are charged to operations as incurred 
costs for major replacements and betterments  which includes hvac equipment  roofs  parking lots  etc  are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
gains and losses are recognized upon disposal or retirement of the related assets and are reflected in earnings 
property is recorded at cost and is depreciated using a straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows buildings and improvements years tenant improvements years equipment and furnishings years accounting for acquisitions the company first determines the value of land and buildings utilizing an as if vacant methodology 
the company then assigns a fair value to any debt assumed at acquisition 
the company then allocates the purchase price based on fair value of the land  building  tenant improvements and identifiable intangible assets received and liabilities assumed 
tenant improvements represent the tangible assets associated with the existing leases valued on a fair value basis at the acquisition date prorated over the remaining lease terms 
the tenant improvements are classified as an asset under 
table of contents property and are depreciated over the remaining lease terms 
identifiable intangible assets and liabilities relate to the value of in place operating leases which come in three forms i leasing commissions and legal costs  which represent the value associated with cost avoidance of acquiring in place leases  such as lease commissions paid under terms generally experienced in the company s markets  ii value of in place leases  which represents the estimated loss of revenue and of costs incurred for the period required to lease the assumed vacant property to the occupancy level when purchased  and iii above or below market value of in place leases  which represents the difference between the contractual rents and market rents at the time of the acquisition  discounted for tenant credit risks 
leasing commissions and legal costs are recorded in deferred charges and other assets and are amortized over the remaining lease terms 
the value of in place leases are recorded in deferred charges and other assets and amortized over the remaining lease terms plus an estimate of renewal of the acquired leases 
above or below market leases are classified in deferred charges and other assets or in other accrued liabilities  depending on whether the contractual terms are above or below market  and the asset or liability is amortized to minimum rents over the remaining terms of the leases 
the allocated values of above and below market leases are amortized into minimum rents on a straight line basis over the individual remaining lease terms 
the remaining lease terms of below market leases may include certain below market fixed rate renewal periods 
in considering whether or not a lessee will execute a below market fixed rate lease renewal option  the company evaluates economic factors and certain qualitative factors at the time of acquisition such as tenant mix in the center  the company s relationship with the tenant and the availability of competing tenant space 
asset impairment the company assesses whether an indicator of impairment in the value of its properties exists by considering expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of demand  competition and other economic factors 
such factors include projected rental revenue  operating costs and capital expenditures as well as estimated holding periods and capitalization rates 
if an impairment indicator exists  the determination of recoverability is made based upon the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows  excluding interest expense 
the amount of impairment loss  if any  is determined by comparing the fair value  as determined by a discounted cash flows analysis  with the carrying value of the related assets 
the company generally holds and operates its properties long term  which decreases the likelihood of its carrying values not being recoverable 
properties classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
the company reviews its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures for a series of operating losses and other factors that may indicate that a decrease in the value of its investments has occurred which is other than temporary 
the investment in each unconsolidated joint venture is evaluated periodically  and as deemed necessary  for recoverability and valuation declines that are other than temporary 
fair value of financial instruments the fair value hierarchy distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity and the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions 
level inputs utilize quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access 
level inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in level that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly 
level inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability other than quoted prices  such as interest rates  foreign exchange rates  and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals 
level inputs are 
table of contents unobservable inputs for the asset or liability  which is typically based on an entity s own assumptions  as there is little  if any  related market activity 
in instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy  the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
the company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment  and considers factors specific to the asset or liability 
the company calculates the fair value of financial instruments and includes this additional information in the notes to consolidated financial statements when the fair value is different than the carrying value of those financial instruments 
when the fair value reasonably approximates the carrying value  no additional disclosure is made 
deferred charges costs relating to obtaining tenant leases are deferred and amortized over the initial term of the agreement using the straight line method 
as these deferred leasing costs represent productive assets incurred in connection with the company s provision of leasing arrangements at the centers  the related cash flows are classified as investing activities within the company s consolidated statements of cash flows 
costs relating to financing of shopping center properties are deferred and amortized over the life of the related loan using the straight line method  which approximates the effective interest method 
in place lease values are amortized over the remaining lease term plus an estimate of the renewal term 
leasing commissions and legal costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the individual remaining lease years 
the ranges of the terms of the agreements are as follows deferred lease costs years deferred financing costs years in place lease values remaining lease term plus an estimate for renewal leasing commissions and legal costs years results of operations many of the variations in the results of operations  discussed below  occurred due to the foregoing transactions involving the acquisition properties  the joint venture centers  the mervyn s properties and the redevelopment center s  as defined below 
for the comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december   the same centers include all consolidated centers  excluding the mervyn s properties  the acquisition properties and the redevelopment center as defined below 
for the comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december   the same centers include all consolidated centers  excluding the mervyn s properties  the joint venture centers and the redevelopment centers as defined below 
for the comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december   the redevelopment center is santa monica place 
for the comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december   the redevelopment centers include northgate mall and santa monica place 
one of the principal reasons for the changes in the results of operations  discussed below  from the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is because of the change in how the company classified the joint venture centers 
the joint venture centers were classified as consolidated centers until the sale of a partial ownership interest in queens center and flatiron crossing on july  and september   respectively 
therefore  the results of operations of queens center for the period of january  to july  and flatiron crossing 
table of contents for the period of january  to september  are included in the company s financial statements as consolidated centers 
results of operations subsequent to the sale of the ownership interest in each joint venture center are included in equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures see acquisitions and dispositions in management s overview and summary 
the increase in revenue and expenses of the redevelopment center during the year ended december  in comparison to the year ended december  and during the year ended december  in comparison to the year ended december  is primarily due to the opening of santa monica place in august unconsolidated joint ventures are reflected using the equity method of accounting 
the company s pro rata share of the results from these centers is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations as equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures 
the company considers tenant annual sales per square foot for tenants in place for months or longer and under  square feet  occupancy rates excluding anchors for the centers and releasing spreads ie a comparison of average base rent per square foot on leases executed during the trailing twelve months to average base rent per square foot on leases expiring during the year to be key performance indicators of the company s internal growth 
tenant sales per square foot increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  occupancy rate decreased from at december  to at december  releasing spreads increased for the year ended december  from the year ended december  these calculations exclude valley view center  granite run mall  shoppingtown mall and centers under development or redevelopment 
the company s recent trend of retail sales growth continued this year with tenant sales per square foot increasing compared to the year ended december  the releasing spreads also increased for the year ended december  and the company expects that releasing spreads will continue to increase during as it renews or relets leases that are scheduled to expire during the year 
the company s occupancy rate as of december  decreased compared to december  primarily because of the liquidation of one tenant 
although certain aspects of the us economy  the retail industry as well as the company s operating results improved during the year ended december   continued worldwide economic and political uncertainty remains 
in addition  the us economy is still experiencing weakness  high levels of unemployment have persisted and rental rates and valuations for retail space have not fully recovered to pre recession levels 
any further continuation of these adverse conditions could harm the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
comparison of years ended december  and revenues minimum and percentage rents collectively referred to as rental revenue increased by million  or  from to the increase in rental revenue is attributed to an increase of million from the acquisition properties  million from the redevelopment center  million from the mervyn s properties and million from the same centers

funds from operations ffo and adjusted funds from operations affo the company uses ffo in addition to net income to report its operating and financial results and considers ffo and ffo diluted as supplemental measures for the real estate industry and a supplement to generally accepted accounting principles gaap measures 
the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit defines ffo as net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from extraordinary items and sales of 
table of contents depreciated operating properties  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization  impairment write downs of real estate and write downs of investments in an affiliate where the write downs have been driven by a decrease in the value of real estate held by the affiliate and after adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis 
the company also adjusts ffo for the noncontrolling interest due to redemption value on the rochester properties see item selected financial data 
affo excludes the negative ffo impact of shoppingtown mall and valley view center for the year ended december  in december  the company conveyed shoppingtown mall to the lender by a deed in lieu of foreclosure and valley view center is in receivership 
ffo and ffo on a diluted basis are useful to investors in comparing operating and financial results between periods 
this is especially true since ffo excludes real estate depreciation and amortization  as the company believes real estate values fluctuate based on market conditions rather than depreciating in value ratably on a straight line basis over time 
in addition  consistent with the key objective of ffo as a measure of operating performance  the adjustment of ffo for the noncontrolling interest in redemption value provides a more meaningful measure of the company s operating performance between periods without reference to the non cash charge related to the adjustment in noncontrolling interest due to redemption value 
the company believes that such a presentation also provides investors with a more meaningful measure of its operating results in comparison to the operating results of other reits 
the company believes that affo and affo on a diluted basis provide useful supplemental information regarding the company s performance as they show a more meaningful and consistent comparison of the company s operating performance and allow investors to more easily compare the company s results without taking into account the unrelated non cash charges on properties controlled by either a receiver or loan servicer  which are non routine items 
ffo and affo on a diluted basis are measures investors find most useful in measuring the dilutive impact of outstanding convertible securities 
ffo and affo do not represent cash flow from operations as defined by gaap  should not be considered as an alternative to net income as defined by gaap  and are not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs 
the company also cautions that ffo and affo  as presented  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other real estate investment trusts 
nareit recently clarified that under its definition of ffo  impairment write downs of real estate should be added back to net income 
beginning with the year ended december   the company has revised its definition of ffo to add back impairment write downs of real estate to its net income 
accordingly  the company removed the adjustment for impairment write downs of million and million  as previously reported during the years ended december  and  respectively 
there was no impairment write downs of real estate during the years ended december  and the reconciliation of ffo and affo and ffo and affo diluted to net income available to common stockholders is provided below 
management compensates for the limitations of ffo and affo by providing investors with financial statements prepared according to gaap  along with this detailed discussion of ffo and affo and a reconciliation of ffo and affo and ffo and affo diluted to net income available to common stockholders 
management believes that to further understand the company s performance  ffo and affo should be compared with the company s reported net income and considered in addition to cash flows in accordance with gaap  as presented in the company s consolidated financial statements
