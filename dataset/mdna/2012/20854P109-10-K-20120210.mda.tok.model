item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this form k for a breakdown by segment 
for the year ended december  average gas sales price before effects of financial settlements per thousand cubic feet average effects of financial settlements per thousand cubic feet average gas sales price including effects of financial settlements per thousand cubic feet average lifting costs excluding ad valorem and severance taxes per thousand cubic feet we enter into physical gas sales transactions with various counterparties for terms varying in length 
reserves and production estimates are believed to be sufficient to satisfy these obligations 
in the past  other than interstate pipeline outages related to maintenance issues or a weather related force majeure event  we have not failed to deliver quantities required under contract 
we also enter into various gas swap transactions that qualify as financial cash flow hedges 
these gas swap transactions exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions and represented approximately billion cubic feet of our produced gas sales volumes for the year ended december  at an average price of per thousand cubic feet 
these financial hedges represented approximately billion cubic feet of our produced gas sales volumes for the year ended december  at an average price of per thousand cubic feet 
as of december   we expect these transactions will cover approximately billion cubic feet of our estimated production at an average price of per thousand cubic feet  billion cubic feet of our estimated production at an average price of per thousand cubic feet  billion cubic feet of our estimated production at an average price of per thousand cubic feet and billion cubic feet of our estimated production at an average price of per thousand cubic feet 
we have purchased firm transportation capacity on various interstate pipelines to ensure gas production flows to market 
as of december   we have secured firm transportation capacity to cover more than our  and hedged production 
the hedging strategy and information regarding derivative instruments used are outlined in part ii item a qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk and in note derivative instruments in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
midstream gas services consol energy has traditionally designed  built and operated natural gas gathering systems to move gas from the wellhead to interstate pipelines or other local sales points 
in addition  consol energy acquired extensive gathering assets in the dominion acquisition in consol energy now owns or operates approximately  miles of gas gathering pipelines as well as  horsepower of compression  of which  approximately is wholly owned with the balance being leased 
along with this compression capacity  consol energy owns and operates a number of gas processing facilities 
this infrastructure is capable of delivering billion cubic feet per year of pipeline quality gas 
on september   in connection with the noble joint venture for marcellus wells and leaseholdings  cone gathering  llc was formed 
consol energy and noble each own of cone gathering 
cone gathering was formed to develop  operate and own both noble s and consol energy s marcellus gathering system needs 
upon formation of cone gathering  consol energy contributed its then existing marcellus shale gathering assets to cone gathering 
we believe that the network of right of ways  vast surface holdings and experience in building and operating gathering systems in the appalachian basin will give cone gathering a tremendous advantage in building the midstream assets required to develop the joint venture s marcellus position 
consol energy has had the advantage of having gas production from cbm  which can be lower btu than pipeline specification  as well as higher btu marcellus production which can complement each other by reducing and in some cases eliminating the need for the costly processing of cbm 
in addition  the lower btu cbm production offers an opportunity to blend ethane back into the gas stream when pricing or capacity for ethane markets dictate 
this will allow consol energy more flexibility in bringing marcellus on line at qualities that meet interstate pipeline specifications 
other operations consol energy provides other services both to our own operations and to others 
these include land services  industrial supply services  terminal services including break bulk  general cargo and warehouse services  river and dock services and water services 
non core mineral assets and surface properties consol energy owns significant coal and gas assets that are not in our short or medium term development plans 
we continually explore the monetization of these non core assets by means of sale  lease  contribution to joint ventures  or a combination of the foregoing in order to bring the value of these assets forward for the benefit of our shareholders 
we also control a significant amount of surface acreage 
this surface acreage is valuable to us in the development of the gathering system for our marcellus shale and utica shale production 
we also derive value from this surface control by granting rights of way or development rights to third parties when we are able to derive appropriate value for our shareholders 
industrial supply services fairmont supply company  a consol energy subsidiary  is a general line distributor of mining  drilling  and industrial supplies in the united states 
fairmont supply has customer service centers nationwide

approximately of fairmont supply s sales in were made to consol energy s coal and gas divisions 
terminal services in  approximately million tons of coal were shipped through consol energy s subsidiary  cnx marine terminal inc s  exporting terminal in the port of baltimore 
approximately of the tonnage shipped was produced by consol energy coal mines 
the terminal can either store coal or load coal directly into vessels from rail cars 
it is also one of the few terminals in the united states served by two railroads  norfolk southern corporation and csx transportation inc river and dock services consol energy s river operations  located in monessen  pennsylvania  transport coal from our mines  coal from other mines and non coal commodities from river loadout facilities located primarily along the monongahela and ohio rivers in northern west virginia and southwestern pennsylvania 
products are delivered to customers along the monongahela  ohio  kanawha and allegheny rivers 
at december   we operated towboats  harbor boats and approximately barges 
in  our river vessels transported a total of million tons of coal and other commodities  including million tons of coal produced by consol energy mines 
consol energy provides dock services for our mines as well as for third parties at our alicia dock  located on the monongahela river in fayette county  pennsylvania 
consol energy transfers coal from rail cars to barges for customers that receive coal on the river system 
water services cnx water assets llc  a consol energy subsidiary  is acquiring and developing existing sources of water used to support our coal and gas operations 
cnx water assets llc  operates an advanced waste water treatment plant in support of coal operations as well as fresh water reservoirs 
cnx water assets objective is to develop and maximize the value of existing water assets  which will be used to provide water for drilling and hydraulic fracturing in support of gas operations and meeting the needs of mining operations 
cnx water also has contracts to provide water to third parties for industrial use from various water sources owned by consol energy 
employee and labor relations at december   consol energy had  employees  approximately of whom were represented by the united mine workers of america umwa 
in  the bituminous coal operators association bcoa and the united mine workers of america umwa reached a new collective bargaining agreement which will run from july  to december  the national bituminous coal wage agreement of nbcwa covers approximately  employees of consol energy subsidiaries 
the nbcwa is the successor agreement to the nbcwa that was set to expire on december  key elements of the new agreement include the following items a 
a wage increase of per hour effective july   and an additional per hour increase each january st throughout the contract term 
b 
contributions to the pension plan  a multi employer plan  will continue at the current rate of per hour throughout the contract term 
new inexperienced miners hired after december  will not participate in the pension plan  but will receive a per hour contribution increasing to per hour in to the umwa cash deferred savings plan cdsp  which is a k plan 
umwa represented employees with over years of credited service under the pension plan will receive a per hour contribution increasing to per hour in to the cdsp beginning january  also beginning january   umwa represented employees will have the right to elect to opt out of future participation in the pension plan and upon such election  will receive a per hour contribution increasing to per hour in to the cdsp 
c 
a per hour contribution starting january  to a new defined contribution plan to provide retiree bonus payments to eligible retirees in  and d 
an increased contribution from per hour to per hour effective january  to the benefit plan  which is a defined contribution plan providing health benefits to certain retirees

various other changes related to absenteeism  contributions to various umwa benefit funds  eligibility for various vacation days and sick days 
laws and regulations the mining and gas industries are subject to regulation by federal  state and local authorities on matters such as the discharge of materials into the environment  permitting and other licensing requirements  reclamation and restoration of properties after mining or gas operations are completed  management of materials generated by mining and gas operations  pipeline compression and transmission of natural gas and liquids  surface subsidence from underground mining  water discharge effluent limits  water appropriation  air quality standards  protection of wetlands  endangered plant and wildlife protection  limitations on land use  storage of petroleum products and substances that are regarded as hazardous under applicable laws  management of electrical equipment containing polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs  legislatively mandated benefits for current and retired coal miners  and employee health and safety 
in addition  the electric power generation industry is subject to extensive regulation regarding the environmental impact of its power generation activities  which could affect demand for consol energy s coal and gas products 
the possibility exists that new legislation or regulations may be adopted which would have a significant impact on consol energy s mining or gas operations or our customers ability to use coal or gas and may require consol energy or our customers to change their operations significantly or incur substantial costs 
numerous governmental permits and approvals are required for mining and gas operations 
regulations provide that a mining permit or modification can be delayed  refused or revoked if an officer  director or a stockholder with a or greater interest in the entity is affiliated with or is in a position to control another entity that has outstanding permit violations 
thus  all mining operations of consol energy entities must be maintained in compliance to avoid delay in issuance of necessary mining permits 
consol energy is  or may be  required to prepare and present to federal  state or local authorities data and or analysis pertaining to the effect or impact that any proposed exploration for or production of coal or gas may have upon the environment  the public and employee health and safety 
permits we need may include requirements that may be subject to future restrictive standards or interpreted in a manner which restricts our ability to conduct our mining and gas operations or to do so profitably 
future legislation and administrative regulations may increasingly emphasize the protection of the environment and employee health and safety 
as a consequence  the activities of consol energy may be more closely regulated 
such legislation and regulations  as well as future interpretations of existing laws  may require substantial increases in equipment and operating costs to consol energy and delays  interruptions or a termination of operations  the extent of which cannot be predicted 
compliance with these laws has substantially increased the cost of mining and gas production for all domestic coal and gas producers 
we post surety performance bonds or letters of credit pursuant to federal and state mining laws and regulations for the estimated costs of reclamation and mine closing  often including the cost of treating mine water discharge 
we also post performance bonds or letters of credit pursuant to state oil and gas laws and regulations to guarantee reclamation of gas well sites and plugging of gas wells 
we endeavor to conduct our mining and gas operations in compliance with all applicable federal  state and local laws and regulations 
however  because of extensive and comprehensive regulatory requirements against a backdrop of variable geologic and seasonal conditions  permit exceedances and violations during mining and gas production can and do occur 
consol energy made capital expenditures for environmental control facilities of approximately million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in were primarily related to starting construction of an advanced water processing system at the buchanan mine 
construction of this facility was completed in in accordance with a consent decree with the us environmental protection agency and the west virginia environmental protection agency  consol energy began construction of an advance water processing system in northern west virginia in construction is expected to be complete in expenditures related to the northern west virginia plant of million were incurred in and total costs related to the construction of this plant and related facilities is expected to be approximately million 
consol energy expects to have capital expenditures of million in for environmental control facilities 
mine health and safety laws legislative and regulatory changes have required us to purchase additional safety equipment  construct stronger seals to isolate mined out areas  and engage in additional training 
we have also experienced more aggressive inspection protocols resulting in the issuance of more citations and with new regulations the amount of civil penalties have increased 
the actions taken thus far by federal and state governments include requiring the caching of additional supplies of self contained self rescuer scsr devices underground  the purchase and installation of electronic communication and personal tracking devices underground  the placement of refuge chambers  which are structures designed to provide refuge for groups of miners during a mine emergency when evacuation from the mine is not possible  which will provide breathable air for hours  the replacement of existing seals in worked out areas of mines with stronger seals  the purchase of new fire resistant conveyor belting underground  additional training and testing that creates the need to hire additional employees  and more stringent rock dusting requirements 
on august   msha published a proposed rule  which if adopted  would require proximity protection for miners 
the proposed rule would require certain underground mining equipment to be equipped with devices that will shut the equipment down if a person is too close to the equipment to avoid injuries where individuals could be caught between equipment and blocks of unmined coal 
msha is also considering new rules to reduce the permissible concentration of respirable dust in underground coal mines 
this rule  if adopted  would reduce the current standard of two milligrams per cubic meter of air to some lower amount 
occupational safety and health act our gas operations are subject to regulation under the federal occupational safety and health act osha and comparable state laws in some states  all of which regulate health and safety of employees at our gas operations 
also  osha s hazardous communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced by our gas operations and that this information be provided to employees  state and local governments and the public 
black lung legislation under federal black lung benefits legislation  each coal mine operator is required to make payments of black lung benefits or contributions to current and former coal miners totally disabled from black lung disease  certain survivors of a miner who dies from black lung disease or pneumoconiosis  and a trust fund for the payment of benefits and medical expenses to claimants whose last mine employment was before january   where no responsible coal mine operator has been identified for claims where a miner s last coal employment was after december   or where the responsible coal mine operator has defaulted on the payment of such benefits 
the trust fund is funded by an excise tax on us production of up to per ton for deep mined coal and up to per ton for surface mined coal  neither amount to exceed of the gross sales price 
the patient protection and affordable care act ppaca  which was implemented in  made two changes to the federal black lung benefits act 
first  it provided changes to the legal criteria used to assess and award claims by creating a legal presumption that miners are entitled to benefits if they have worked at least years in underground coal mines  or in similar conditions  and suffer from a totally disabling lung disease 
to rebut this presumption  a coal company would have to prove that a miner did not have black lung or that the disease was not caused by the miner s work 
second  it changed the law so black lung benefits will continue to be paid to dependent survivors when the miner passes away  regardless of the cause of the miner s death 
in addition to the federal legislation  we are also liable under various state statutes for black lung claims 
retiree health benefits legislation the coal industry retiree health benefit act of the act established the combined benefit fund the combined fund 
the combined fund provides medical and death benefits for all beneficiaries including orphan retirees of the former united mine workers of america umwa benefit trusts who were actually receiving benefits as of july  the act also created a second benefit fund for umwa retirees  the benefit plan 
the benefit plan principally provides medical and death benefits to orphan umwa represented members eligible for retirement on february   and who actually retired between july  and september  the act provides for the assignment of beneficiaries to former signatory employers or related companies and the allocation of responsibility for unassigned beneficiaries referred to as orphans to the assigned operators 
the task of calculating the annual per beneficiary premium that assigned operators are obligated to pay to the combined fund is the responsibility of the commissioner of social security 
the umwa benefit plan is a defined contribution plan that was created as the result of negotiations for the national bituminous coal wage agreement nbcwa of this plan provides health care benefits to orphan umwa retirees who are not eligible to participate in the combined fund  the benefit fund  or whose last employer signed the nbcwa or a later nbcwa  and who subsequently goes out of business 
the act requires some of our signatory subsidiaries to make premium payments to the combined fund and to the benefit plan for the cost of our retirees and orphan retirees in those plans 
in addition  the nbcwa of requires our signatory subsidiaries to make specified payments to the benefit plan through the tax relief and health care act of the act provides additional federal funding for these orphan costs by authorizing general fund revenues and expanding transfers of interest from the abandoned mine land aml trust fund 
the additional federal funding  depending upon its magnitude and the amount of orphan benefits payable  should cover the orphan premium payments due under the combined fund as well as the orphan premium payments due under the benefit plan 
federal contributions were in and are expected to continue to be after in addition  federal contributions cover the costs for those orphan retirees as of december  under the benefit plan 
under the act  these general fund contributions to the combined fund  the benefit plan and the benefit plan and certain aml payments to the states and indian tribes are collectively limited by an aggregate annual cap of million 
these federal contributions do not apply to our subsidiaries assigned retired miners  and therefore our subsidiaries will continue to make premium payments for our assigned retired miners who receive benefits from the combined fund  the benefit plan and for certain beneficiaries of the benefit plan 
in addition  our subsidiaries remain responsible for making orphan premium payments to the combined fund and benefit plan to the extent that the federal contributions are not sufficient to cover the benefits 
pension protection act the pension protection act of the pension act has simplified and transformed rules governing the funding of defined benefit plans  accelerated funding obligations of employers  made permanent certain provisions of the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of egtrra  made permanent the diversification rights and investment education provisions for plan participants and encourages automatic enrollment in defined contribution k plans 
in general  most provisions of the pension act of are in effect for plan years beginning on or after december  plans generally are required to set a funding target of of the present value of accrued benefits and sponsors are required to amortize unfunded liabilities over a seven year period 
the pension act includes a funding target of after plans with a funded ratio of less than  or less than using special assumptions  will be deemed to be at risk and will be subject to additional funding requirements 
the plan year funding ratio of consol energy s salary retirement plan was 
the funding ratio is subject to year over year volatility and internal revenue service s calculation guidelines 
environmental laws consol energy is subject to various federal environmental laws  including the surface mining control and reclamation act of  the clean air act  the clean water act  the endangered species act  the resource conservation and recovery act  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  the toxic substances control act  and the emergency planning and community right to know act  as administered and enforced by the united states environmental protection agency epa and or authorized federal or state agencies  as well as state laws of similar scope  and other state environmental and conservation laws in each state in which consol energy operates 
these environmental laws require reporting  permitting and or approval of many aspects of coal mining and gas operations 
both federal and state inspectors regularly visit mines and other facilities to ensure compliance 
consol energy has ongoing compliance and permitting programs designed to ensure compliance with such environmental laws 
given the retroactive nature of certain environmental laws  consol energy has incurred  and may in the future incur liabilities in connection with properties and facilities currently or previously owned or operated 
these liabilities may be increased to include sites to which consol energy or our subsidiaries sent waste materials 
surface mining control and reclamation act the surface mining control and reclamation act smcra establishes minimum national operational  reclamation and closure standards for all surface mines as well as most aspects of deep mines 
smcra requires that comprehensive environmental protection and reclamation standards be met during the course of and following completion of mining activities 
permits for all mining operations must be obtained from the office of surface mining osm or  where state regulatory agencies have adopted federally approved state programs under smcra  the appropriate state regulatory authority 
states that operate federally approved state programs may impose standards which are more stringent than the requirements of smcra and osm s regulations and in many instances have done so 
all states in which consol energy s active mining operations are located have achieved primary jurisdiction for enforcement of smcra through approved state programs 
smcra permit provisions include requirements for coal exploration  baseline environmental data collection and analysis  mine plan development  topsoil removal  storage and replacement  selective handling of overburden materials  mine pit backfilling and grading  protection of the hydrologic balance  subsidence control for underground mines  refuse disposal plans  surface drainage control  mine drainage and mine discharge control and treatment  and site reclamation 
all states also impose an obligation on surface mining operations to restore or replace domestic  agricultural or industrial water supplies and on underground mine operations to restore or replace drinking  domestic or residential water supplies adversely affected by such operations 
in addition  smcra imposes a reclamation fee on all current mining operations  the proceeds of which are deposited in the abandoned mine reclamation fund aml fund  which is used to restore unreclaimed and abandoned mine lands mined before the current per ton fee is per ton for surface mined coal and per ton for underground mined coal 
from october  through september   the fees will be per ton for surface mined coal and per ton for underground mined coal 
osm is currently considering modifications to the existing stream buffer zone regulation  which amendments are referred to as the stream protection rule 
an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking anpr was published in november based on the anpr  the proposed rule would apply to surface mining as well as underground mining activities that may impact streams 
although it is too early to predict what the impacts of the proposed amendments will be  all of the alternatives identified in the anpr could result in loss of access to significant amounts of coal and or significant increases in reclamation costs 
in pennsylvania  where consol energy operates two longwall mines  approximately million  million and million of expenses were incurred during the years ended december   and  respectively  to mitigate and repair impacts on streams from subsidence 
with respect to subsidence impacts to streams  the regulatory requirement to minimize impacts to the hydrologic balance could cause consol energy to change mine plans  to incur significant costs  and potentially even shut down mines in order to meet compliance requirements 
we currently estimate expenses related to subsidence of streams in pennsylvania will be approximately million for the year ended december  clean air act and related regulations the federal clean air act and similar state laws and regulations which regulate emissions into the air  affect coal mining  coal handling and processing  and gas production and processing operations primarily through permitting and or emissions control requirements 
the clean air act also indirectly affects coal mining operations by extensively regulating the air emissions of the coal fired electric power generating plants operated by our customers 
coal contains impurities  such as sulfur  mercury and other constituents  many of which are released into the air when coal is burned 
carbon dioxide  a greenhouse gas  is also emitted when coal is burned 
environmental regulations governing emissions from coal fired electric generating plants could affect demand for coal as a fuel source and affect the volume of our sales 
in  the epa promulgated or finalized several rulemakings impacting coal generating facilities 
these include the cross state air pollution rule to regulate sulfur dioxide so  nitrogen dioxide so and fine particulate matter  and the utility maximum achievable control technology utility mact rule which sets new mercury and air toxic standards and includes more stringent new source performance standards nsps for particulate matter pm  so and so 
in addition  the epa is proposing to establish nsps for green house gas ghg emissions from new electric generating units and proposed regulations to establish ghg emission limits for new and modified electric generating units 
the epa anticipates that a notice of proposed rulemaking nopr will be published in the federal register in early such regulations could significantly increase the cost of generation of electricity at coal fired facilities and could make competing forms of electricity generation more competitive 
the clean air act and comparable state laws restrict the emission of air pollutants from compressor stations and other equipment and facilities used in our gas operations 
we are required to obtain pre approval for construction or modification of certain facilities  to meet stringent air permit requirements  or to use specific equipment  technologies or best management practices to control emissions 
in august  the epa published proposed revisions to the nsps and proposed revisions to the national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants neshaps for the oil and natural gas sector 
the epa intends to issue the final revisions in early in september  the epa finalized the mandatory reporting of greenhouse gas rule 
the current version of this rule requires reporting of emissions from coal mines and gas wells and associated facilities for emissions 
clean water act the federal clean water act cwa and corresponding state laws affect coal and gas operations by regulating discharges into surface waters 
permits requiring regular monitoring and compliance with effluent limitations and reporting requirements govern the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters 
the clean water act and corresponding state laws include requirements for improvement of designated impaired waters not meeting state water quality standards through the use of effluent limitations  anti degradation regulations which protect state designated high quality exceptional use streams by restricting or prohibiting discharges  requirements to treat discharges from coal mining properties for non traditional pollutants  such as chlorides  selenium and dissolved solids  for minimizing impacts and compensating for unavoidable impacts resulting from discharges of fill materials to regulated streams and wetlands  and the requirements to dispose of produced wastes and other oil and gas wastes at approved disposal facilities 
in addition  the spill prevention  control and countermeasure spcc requirements of the cwa apply to all consol energy operations that use or produce fluids  including brine and oil  and require that plans be in place to address any spills and that secondary containment be installed around all tanks 
these requirements may cause consol energy to incur significant additional costs that could adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
in order to obtain a permit for surface coal mining activities  including valley fills associated with steep slope mining  an operator must obtain a permit for the discharge of fill material from the army corps of engineers the coe pursuant to section of the clean water act and must obtain a discharge permit from the state regulatory authority under the state counterpart to section of the clean water act authorizing the issuance of national pollutant discharge elimination permits or npdes permits 
beginning in early  the epa took a number of initiatives that have resulted in delays and obstruction of the issuance of such permits for surface mining operation in the states of kentucky  ohio  pennsylvania  tennessee  virginia and west virginia designated as appalachian surface coal mining 
increased oversight of delegated state programmatic authority  coupled with individual permit review and additional requirements imposed by the epa  has resulted in delays in the review and issuance of permits for surface coal mining operations  including applications for surface facilities for underground mines  such as applications for coal refuse disposal areas 
thus far  consol energy subsidiaries have been able to continue operating their existing mines 
however  such delays and obstructions in the permitting process may cause consol energy to incur additional costs that could adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
pursuant to a congressional requirement in the epa s budget appropriation  the epa must conduct a comprehensive study of the potential adverse impact that hydraulic fracturing may have on water quality and public health 
hydraulic fracturing is a way of producing gas from tight rock formations such as the barnett and marcellus shales 
the epa initiated the study in early january and plans to make the initial study results available by late  with a final report to congress soon thereafter 
the epa has also announced plans to conduct a review of water produced in conjunction with the production of coal bed methane cbm to determine whether its disposal should be further regulated 
endangered species act the federal endangered species act esa and similar state laws protect species threatened with extinction 
protection of endangered and threatened species may cause us to modify mining plans  gas well pad siting or pipeline right of ways  or develop and implement species specific protection and enhancement plans to avoid or minimize impacts to endangered species or their habitats 
a number of species indigenous to the areas where we operate are protected under the esa 
based on the species that have been identified and the current application of applicable laws and regulations  we do not believe that there are any species protected under the esa or state laws that would materially and adversely affect our ability to mine coal or produce gas from our properties 
comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act superfund the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act superfund and similar state laws create liabilities for the investigation and remediation of releases of hazardous substances into the environment and for damages to natural resources 
we could incur liability under cercla relative to our coal or gas operations 
our current and former coal mining operations incur  and will continue to incur  expenditures associated with the investigation and remediation of facilities and environmental conditions  including underground storage tanks  solid and hazardous waste disposal and other matters under superfund and similar state environmental laws 
we also must comply with reporting requirements under the emergency planning and community right to know act and the toxic substances control act 
from time to time  we have been the subject of administrative proceedings  litigation and investigations relating to sites that have released hazardous substances 
we have been in the past and currently are named as a potentially responsible party at superfund sites 
we may become involved in future proceedings  litigation or investigations and incur liabilities that could be materially adverse to us 
resource conservation and recovery act the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra and corresponding state laws and regulations affect coal mining and gas operations by imposing requirements for the treatment  storage and disposal of hazardous wastes 
facilities at which hazardous wastes have been treated  stored or disposed are subject to corrective action orders issued by the epa which could adversely affect our results  financial condition and cash flows 
the epa is currently reconsidering the regulation of coal combustion waste  with a decision expected in late depending on the outcome of that decision  demand for coal fired electricity generation could be adversely impacted 
federal regulation of the sale and transportation of gas various aspects of our gas operations are regulated by agencies of the federal government 
the federal energy regulatory commission regulates the transportation and sale of natural gas in interstate commerce pursuant to the natural gas act of and the natural gas policy act of in  congress enacted the natural gas wellhead decontrol act  which removed all natural gas act and natural gas policy act price and non price controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas effective january  while first sales by producers of natural gas  and all sales of condensate and natural gas liquids can be made currently at uncontrolled market prices  congress could reenact price controls in the future 
regulations and orders set forth by the federal energy regulatory commission also impact our gas business to a certain degree 
although the federal energy regulatory commission does not directly regulate our gas production activities  the federal energy regulatory commission has stated that it intends for certain of its orders to foster increased competition within all phases of the natural gas industry 
additionally  the federal energy regulatory commission continues to review its transportation regulations  including whether to allocate all short term capacity on the basis of competitive auctions and whether changes to its long term transportation policies may also be appropriate to avoid a market bias toward short term contracts 
additional federal energy regulatory commission orders have been adopted based on this review with the goal of increasing competition for natural gas markets and transportation 
the federal energy regulatory commission has also issued numerous orders confirming the sale and abandonment of natural gas gathering facilities previously owned by interstate pipelines and acknowledging that if the federal energy regulatory commission does not have jurisdiction over services provided by these facilities  then such facilities and services may be subject to regulation by state authorities in accordance with state law 
in addition  the federal energy regulatory commission s approval of transfers of previously regulated gathering systems to independent or pipeline affiliated gathering companies that are not subject to federal energy regulatory commission regulation may affect competition for gathering or natural gas marketing services in areas served by those systems and thus may affect both the costs and the nature of gathering services that will be available to interested producers or shippers in the future 
we own certain natural gas pipeline facilities that we believe meet the traditional tests which the federal energy regulatory commission has used to establish a pipeline s status as a gatherer not subject to the federal energy regulatory commission jurisdiction additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the gas industry may be pending before congress  the federal energy regulatory commission  the minerals management service  state commissions and the courts 
we cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective 
in the past  the natural gas industry has been heavily regulated 
there is no assurance that the regulatory approach currently pursued by various agencies will continue indefinitely 
notwithstanding the foregoing  we do not anticipate that compliance with existing federal  state and local laws  rules and regulations will have a significantly adverse effect upon the capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position of consol energy or its subsidiaries 
no material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the federal government 
state regulation of gas operations our gas operations are also subject to regulation at the state and in some cases  county  municipal and local governmental levels 
such regulation includes requiring permits for the siting and construction of well pads and roads  drilling of wells  bonding requirements  protection of ground water and surface water resources and protection of drinking water supplies  the method of drilling and casing wells  the surface use and restoration of well sites  gas flaring  the plugging and abandoning of wells  the disposal of fluids used in connection with operations  and gas operations producing coalbed methane in relation to active mining 
a number of states have either enacted new laws or may be considering the adequacy of existing laws affecting gathering rates and or services 
other state regulation of gathering facilities generally includes various safety  environmental and in some circumstances  nondiscriminatory take requirements  but does not generally entail rate regulation 
thus  natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny of state agencies in the future 
our gathering operations could be adversely affected should they be subject in the future to increased state regulation of rates or services  although we do not believe that they would be affected by such regulation any differently than other natural gas producers or gatherers 
however  these regulatory burdens may affect profitability  and we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such regulations 
ownership of mineral rights consol energy acquires ownership or leasehold rights to coal and gas properties prior to conducting operations on those properties 
as is customary in the coal and gas industries  we have generally conducted only a summary review of the title to coal and gas rights that are not in our development plans  but which we believe we control 
this summary review is conducted at the time of acquisition or as part of a review of our land records to determine control of mineral rights 
given consol energy s long history as a coal producer  we believe we have a well developed ownership position relating to our coal control  however  our ownership of oil and gas rights  particularly those rights that we acquired in connection with our historic coal operations  is less developed 
as we continue to review our land records and confirm title in anticipation of development  we expect that adjustments to our ownership position either increases or decreases will be required 
prior to the commencement of development operations on coal or gas properties  we conduct a thorough title examination and perform curative work with respect to significant defects 
we are typically responsible for the cost of curing any title defects 
we generally will not commence operations on a property until we have cured any material title defects on such property 
we have completed title work on substantially all of our coal and gas producing properties and believe that we have satisfactory title to our producing properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the industry 
a recent decision by the intermediate appellate court in pennsylvania in a case captioned butler v 
powers pa 
superior ct  no 
mda did not change the law of pennsylvania with respect to the ownership of marcellus shale gas rights  but in remanding the case to the trial court for further proceedings  it called into question the applicability of a long standing presumption known as the dunham rule to gas in the marcellus shale 
the dunham rule is a presumption that a reservation or conveyance of minerals does not reserve or convey oil and gas absent an express reference to oil and gas 
we believe that the pennsylvania courts will ultimately confirm that the dunham rule applies to marcellus shale gas  however  if the pennsylvania courts were to hold otherwise  we could be exposed to lawsuits challenging our rights to marcellus shale gas in some of our pennsylvania properties where our rights derive from persons who did not also own the mineral rights and we may have to incur substantial additional costs to perfect our gas title in those pennsylvania properties 
the ownership of cbm is an issue under the laws of some states  including states in which we operate 
the following summary sets forth an analysis of provisions of pennsylvania  virginia and west virginia law relating to the ownership of cbm 
these summaries do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the provisions of applicable law and rights and the laws relating to traditional natural gas resources may differ materially from the rights related to cbm 
these summaries are based on current law as of the date of this annual report on form k 
pennsylvania in pennsylvania  cbm that remains inside the coal seam is generally the property of the owner of that coal seam where the gas is located 
cbm can be sold in place or leased by the coal owner to another party such as a producer who then would have the right to extract the gas from the coal seam under the terms of the agreement with the coal owner 
once the gas migrates from the coal into other strata  the coal owner no longer has clear title to that migrated gas 
as a result  in certain circumstances in pennsylvania eg  in a gob or mine void  we may be required to obtain other property interests beyond ownership or leasehold interest in the coal rights or cbm in order to extract gas that is no longer located in the coal seam 
we believe that under pennsylvania law  a coal lessee under a lease to exhaustion would be in the same position as the coal owner with respect to ownership of the cbm 
virginia the virginia supreme court has stated that the grant of coal rights only does not include rights to cbm  absent evidence to the contrary 
the situation may be different if there is any expression in the severance deed indicating that more than mere coal is conveyed 
virginia courts have also found that the owner of the cbm does not have the right to fracture the coal in order to retrieve the cbm and that the coal operator has the right to ventilate the cbm in the course of mining 
in virginia  we believe that we control the relevant property rights in order to capture gas from our producing properties 
when necessary  we utilize an administrative procedure established by virginia law that permits the development of cbm by an operator in those instances where the owner of the cbm has not leased it to the operator or in situations where there are conflicting claims of ownership of the cbm within a drilling unit 
the general practice is to force pool both the coal owner and the gas owner by filing an application with and obtaining an order from the virginia gas and oil board that permits the development of the cbm in the drilling unit notwithstanding lack of control of the cbm or conflicting claims of ownership 
any royalties otherwise payable to conflicting claimants are paid into escrow and the burden then is upon the conflicting claimants to establish ownership by court action 
the virginia gas and oil board does not make ownership decisions 
several lawsuits are pending in virginia state courts and several purported class action lawsuits are pending in the federal district court for the western district of virginia in abingdon  virginia  including two lawsuits to which a consol energy subsidiary is named as a defendant  which seek  among other things  a court order establishing ownership of the cbm relating to the royalties currently held in escrow 
west virginia the ownership of cbm is largely an open question in west virginia 
the west virginia supreme court has held that under a conventional oil and gas lease executed prior to the inception of widespread public knowledge regarding cbm operations  the oil and gas lessee did not acquire the right to produce cbm 
the west virginia courts have not further clarified who owns cbm in west virginia 
west virginia has enacted the coalbed methane wells and units act the west virginia act  regulating the commercial recovery and marketing of cbm 
although the west virginia act does not specify who owns  or has the right to exploit  cbm in west virginia and instead refers ownership disputes to judicial resolution  it contains provisions similar to virginia s force pooling law described above 
under the pooling provisions of the west virginia act  an applicant who proposes to drill can prosecute an administrative proceeding with the west virginia coalbed methane review board to obtain authority to produce cbm from pooled acreage 
owners and claimants of cbm interests who have not consented to the drilling are afforded certain elective forms of participation in the drilling eg  royalty or owner  but their consent is not required to obtain a pooling order authorizing the production of cbm by the operator within the boundaries of the drilling unit 
the west virginia act also provides that  where title to subsurface minerals has been severed in such a way that title to coal and title to natural gas are vested in different persons  the operator of a cbm well permitted  drilled and completed under color of title to the cbm from either the coal seam owner or the natural gas owner has an affirmative defense to an action for willful trespass relating to the drilling and commercial production of cbm from that well 
other states we have rights to extract cbm where we have coal rights in other states 
the ownership of cbm in the illinois basin and certain other western basins may be uncertain or could belong to other holders of real estate interests and we may need to acquire additional rights from other holders of real estate interests to extract and produce cbm in these other states available information consol energy maintains a website on the world wide web at www

risk factors investment in our securities is subject to various risks  including risks and uncertainties inherent in our business 
the following sets forth factors related to our business  operations  financial position or future financial performance or cash flows which could cause an investment in our securities to decline and result in a loss 
deterioration in the global economic conditions in any of the industries in which our customers operate  or sustained uncertainty in financial markets  may have adverse impacts on our business and financial condition that we currently cannot predict 
economic conditions in a number of industries in which our customers operate  such as electric power generation and steel making  substantially deteriorated in recent years and reduced the demand for natural gas and coal 
although global industrial activity recovered in from levels  the continuation of the recovery  especially for industries in the united states and europe  is uncertain 
during recent years  financial markets in the united states  europe and asia also experienced unprecedented turmoil and upheaval 
this was characterized by extreme volatility and declines in security prices  severely diminished liquidity and credit availability  inability to access capital markets  the bankruptcy  failure  collapse or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the united states federal government and other governments 
although we cannot predict the impacts  renewed weakness in the economic conditions of any of the industries we serve or in the financial markets could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition 
for example demand for natural gas and electricity in the united states is impacted by industrial production  which if weakened would negatively impact the revenues  margins and profitability of our natural gas and thermal coal business  demand for metallurgical coal depends on steel demand in the united states and globally  which if weakened would negatively impact the revenues  margins and profitability of our metallurgical coal business including our ability to sell our high volatile steam coal as higher priced metallurgical coal  the tightening of credit or lack of credit availability to our customers could adversely affect our ability to collect our trade receivables and the amount of receivables eligible for sale pursuant to our accounts receivable securitization facility may decline  our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like  or need  to raise capital for our business including for exploration and or development of our coal or gas reserves  and our commodity hedging arrangements could become ineffective if our counterparties are unable to perform their obligations or seek bankruptcy protection 
a significant or extended decline in the prices consol energy receives for our coal and natural gas could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows 
our financial results are significantly affected by the prices we receive for our coal and natural gas 
extended or substantial price declines for coal would adversely affect our operating results for future periods and our ability to generate cash flows necessary to improve productivity and expand operations 
prices of coal may fluctuate due to factors beyond our control such as overall domestic and global economic conditions  the consumption pattern of industrial consumers  electricity generators and residential users  increased utilization by the steel industry of electric arc furnaces or pulverized coal processes to make steel which do not use furnace coke  an intermediate product produced from metallurgical coal  technological advances affecting energy consumption  domestic and foreign government regulations  price and availability of alternative fuels  price of foreign imports  and weather conditions 
any adverse change in these factors could result in weaker demand and possibly lower prices for our coal production  which would reduce our revenues 
gas prices are closely linked to supply of natural gas and consumption patterns in the united states of the electric power generation industry and certain industrial and residential patterns where gas is the principal fuel 
natural gas prices are very volatile  and even relatively modest drops in prices can significantly affect our financial results and impede growth 
changes in natural gas prices have a significant impact on the value of our reserves and on our cash flow 
in the past we have used hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to market price volatility when we deemed it appropriate 
if we choose not to engage in  or reduce our use of hedging arrangements in the future  we may be more adversely affected by changes in natural gas prices than our competitors who engage in hedging arrangements to a greater extent than we do 
prices for natural gas may fluctuate widely in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control  such as the domestic and foreign supply of natural gas  the price of foreign imports  overall domestic and global economic conditions  the consumption pattern of industrial consumers  electricity generators and residential users  weather conditions  technological advances affecting energy consumption  domestic and foreign governmental regulations  proximity and capacity of gas pipelines and other transportation facilities  and the price and availability of alternative fuels 
many of these factors may be beyond our control 
in particular  while demand for natural gas has recovered to pre recession levels  the us natural gas industry continues to face concerns of oversupply due to the success of new shale plays and continued drilling in these plays  despite lower gas prices  to meet drilling commitments 
lower natural gas prices may not only decrease our revenues on a per unit basis  but may also limit our access to capital 
a significant decrease in price levels for an extended period would negatively affect us in several ways 
these include reduced cash flow  which would decrease funds available for capital expenditures employed to replace reserves or increase production 
for example  natural gas prices recently fell to ten year lows and we recently announced a significant reduction in the number of wells expected to be drilled in our noble joint venture 
also  our access to other sources of capital  such as equity or long term debt markets  could be severely limited or unavailable 
additionally  lower natural gas prices may reduce the amount of natural gas that we can produce economically 
this may result in our having to make substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves 
if this occurs  or if our estimates of development costs increase  production data factors change or our exploration results deteriorate  accounting rules may require us to write down  as a non cash charge to earnings  the carrying value of our natural gas properties 
we are required to perform impairment tests on our assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction of the estimated useful life or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or whenever management s plans change with respect to those assets 
we may incur impairment charges in the future  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in the period taken 
we expect in the future that we and our joint venture partners will increase drilling activity in areas of shale formations which may also contain natural gas liquids and or oil 
the prices for natural gas liquids and oil are volatile for reasons similar to those described above regarding natural gas 
if we discover and produce significant amounts of natural gas liquids or oil  our results of operation may be adversely affected by downward fluctuations in natural gas liquids and oil prices 
if coal customers do not extend existing contracts or do not enter into new long term coal contracts  profitability of consol energy s operations could be affected 
during the year ended december   approximately of the coal consol energy produced was sold under long term contracts contracts with terms of one year or more 
if a substantial portion of consol energy s long term contracts are modified or terminated or if force majeure is exercised  consol energy would be adversely affected if we are unable to replace the contracts or if new contracts are not at the same level of profitability 
if existing customers do not honor current contract commitments  our revenue would be adversely affected 
the profitability of our long term coal supply contracts depends on a variety of factors  which vary from contract to contract and fluctuate during the contract term  including our production costs and other factors 
price changes  if any  provided in long term supply contracts may not reflect our cost increases  and therefore  increases in our costs may reduce our profit margins 
in addition  in periods of declining market prices  provisions in our long term coal contracts for adjustment or renegotiation of prices and other provisions may increase our exposure to short term coal price volatility 
as a result  consol energy may not be able to obtain long term agreements at favorable prices compared to either market conditions  as they may change from time to time  or our cost structure and long term contracts may not contribute to our profitability 
the loss of  or significant reduction in  purchases by our largest customers could adversely affect our revenues 
for the year ended december   we derived over of our total revenues from sales to one customer individually and more than of our total revenue from sales to our four largest coal and gas customers 
at december   we had approximately seventeen coal supply agreements with these customers that expire at various times from to we are currently discussing the extension of existing agreements or entering into new long term agreements with some of these customers  but these negotiations may not be successful and these customers may not continue to purchase coal from us under long term coal supply agreements 
if any one of these four customers were to significantly reduce their purchases of coal from us  or if we were unable to sell coal to them on terms as favorable to us as the terms under our current agreements  our financial condition and results of operations could suffer 
our ability to collect payments from our customers could be impaired if their creditworthiness declines or if they fail to honor their contracts with us 
our ability to receive payment for coal and gas sold and delivered depends on the continued creditworthiness of our customers 
some power plant owners may have credit ratings that are below investment grade 
we also have been increasing exports to international customers and may have exposure to their creditworthiness 
if the creditworthiness of our customers declines significantly  our million accounts receivable securitization program and our business could be adversely affected 
in addition  if customers refuse to accept shipments of our coal for which they have an existing contractual obligation  our revenues will decrease and we may have to reduce production at our mines until our customer s contractual obligations are honored 
the availability and reliability of transportation facilities and fluctuations in transportation costs could affect the demand for our coal or impair our ability to supply coal to our customers 
similarly  our gas business depends on gathering  processing and transportation facilities owned by others and the disruption of  capacity constraints in  or proximity to pipeline systems could limit sales of our natural gas 
coal producers depend upon rail  barge  trucking  overland conveyor and other systems to provide access to markets 
disruption of transportation services because of weather related problems  strikes  lock outs  break downs of locks and dams or other events could temporarily impair our ability to supply coal to customers and adversely affect our profitability 
transportation costs represent a significant portion of the delivered cost of coal and  as a result  the cost of delivery is a critical factor in a customer s purchasing decision 
increases in transportation costs could make our coal less competitive 
we gather  process and transport our gas to market by utilizing pipelines and facilities owned by others 
if pipelines and facilities do not exist near our producing wells  if pipeline or facility capacity is limited or if pipeline or facility capacity is unexpectedly disrupted  our gas sales could be limited  reducing our profitability 
if we cannot access processing pipeline transportation facilities  we may have to reduce our production of gas or vent our produced gas to the atmosphere because we do not have facilities to store excess inventory 
if our sales of gas are reduced because of transportation or processing constraints  our revenues will be reduced  and our unit costs will also increase 
if pipeline quality tariffs change  we might be required to install additional processing equipment which could increase our costs 
the pipeline could also curtail our flows until the gas delivered to their pipeline is in compliance 
competition within the coal and natural gas industries may adversely affect our ability to sell our products 
increased competition or a loss of our competitive position could adversely affect our sales of  or our prices for  our coal and natural gas products  which could impair our profitability 
consol energy competes with coal producers in various regions of the united states and with some foreign coal producers for domestic sales primarily to electric power generators 
consol energy also competes with both domestic and foreign coal producers for sales in international markets 
demand for our coal by our principal customers is affected by the delivered price of competing coals  other fuel supplies and alternative generating sources  including nuclear  natural gas  oil and renewable energy sources  such as hydroelectric and wind power 
consol energy sells coal to foreign electricity generators and to the more specialized metallurgical coal market  both of which are significantly affected by international demand and competition 
increases in coal prices could encourage existing producers to expand capacity or could encourage new producers to enter the market 
if overcapacity results  prices could fall or we may not be able to sell our coal  which would reduce revenue 
the gas industry is intensely competitive with companies from various regions of the united states 
we compete with these companies and we may compete with foreign companies for domestic sales 
many of the companies we compete with are larger and have greater financial  technological  human and other resources 
if we are unable to compete  our company  our operating results and financial position may be adversely affected 
in addition  larger companies may be able to pay more to acquire new gas properties for future exploration  limiting our ability to replace natural gas we produce or to grow our production 
our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover new natural gas resources also depends on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate these transactions in a highly competitive environment 
we could be negatively affected if we fail to maintain satisfactory labor relations 
as of december   we had  employees 
approximately of these employees are represented by the united mine workers of america umwa and represented operations generated approximately of our us coal production during the year ended december  relations with our employees and  where applicable  organized labor relations are important to our success 
if we do not maintain satisfactory labor relations with our organized and non represented employees  we may incur strikes  other work stoppages or have reduced productivity 
the characteristics of coal may make it costly for electric power generators and other coal users to comply with various environmental standards regarding the emissions of impurities released when coal is burned which could cause utilities to replace coal fired power plants with alternative fuels 
in addition  various incentives have been proposed to encourage the generation of electricity from renewable energy sources 
a reduction in the use of coal for electric power generation could decrease the volume of our coal sales and adversely affect our results of operation 
coal contains impurities  including sulfur  mercury  chlorine and other elements or compounds  many of which are released into the air along with fine particulate matter and carbon dioxide when coal is burned 
complying with regulations on these emissions can be costly for electric power generators 
for example  in order to meet the federal clean air act limits for sulfur dioxide emissions from electric power plants  coal users will need to install scrubbers  use sulfur dioxide emission allowances some of which they may purchase  or switch to other fuels 
each option has limitations 
lower sulfur coal may be more costly to purchase on an energy basis than higher sulfur coal depending on mining and transportation costs 
the cost of installing scrubbers is significant and emission allowances may become more expensive as their availability declines 
switching to other fuels may require expensive modification of existing plants 
because higher sulfur coal currently accounts for a significant portion of our sales  the extent to which electric power generators switch to alternative fuel could materially affect us 
adoption of the cross state air pollution rule caspr in july to be effective january   but currently subject to a stay and the mercury and air toxic standards rule mats in december requiring reductions in emissions of mercury  sulfur dioxides  nitrogen oxides  and particulate matter may require the installation of additional costly control technology or the implementation of other measures  including trading of emission allowances and switching to alternative fuels 
these additional reductions in permissible emission levels of impurities by coal fired plants will likely make it more costly to operate coal fired electric power plants and may make coal a less attractive fuel alternative for electric power generation in the future 
apart from actual and potential regulation of emissions from coal fired plants  state and federal mandates for increased use of electricity from renewable energy sources could have an impact on the market for our coal 
several states have enacted legislative mandates requiring electricity suppliers to use renewable energy sources to generate a certain percentage of power 
there have been numerous proposals to establish a similar uniform  national standard although none of these proposals have been enacted to date 
possible advances in technologies and incentives  such as tax credits  to enhance the economics of renewable energy sources could make these sources more competitive with coal 
any reductions in the amount of coal consumed by domestic electric power generators as a result of current or new standards for the emission of impurities or incentives to switch to alternative fuels or renewable energy sources could reduce the demand for our coal  thereby reducing our revenues and adversely affecting our business and results of operations 
regulation of greenhouse gas emissions as well as uncertainty concerning such regulation could adversely impact the market for coal and natural gas and the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions may increase our operating costs and reduce the value of our coal and gas assets 
while climate change legislation in the us is unlikely in the next several years  the issue of global climate change continues to attract considerable public and scientific attention with widespread concern about the impacts of human activity  especially the emissions of greenhouse gases ghgs  such as carbon dioxide and methane 
combustion of fossil fuels  such as the coal and gas we produce  results in the creation of carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere by coal and gas end users  such as coal fired electric power generation plants 
numerous proposals have been made and are likely to continue to be made at the international  national  regional and state levels of government that are intended to limit emissions of ghgs 
several states have already adopted measures requiring reduction of ghgs within state boundaries 
internationally  the kyoto protocol  which set binding emission targets for developed countries including the united states but has not been ratified by the united states expires in regulation of ghgs could occur in the united states pursuant to the environmental protection agency epa regulation under the clean air act 
on december  the epa announced that it will propose standards for ghg emissions for gas  oil and coal fired power plants in july and issue final standards in may these proposed standards are now scheduled to be published in early apart from governmental regulation  on february   three of wall street s largest investment banks announced that they had adopted climate change guidelines for lenders 
the guidelines require the evaluation of carbon risks in the financing of electric power generation plants which may make it more difficult for utilities to obtain financing for coal fired plants 
if comprehensive regulation focusing on ghgs emission reductions is adopted for the united states by the epa or in other countries where we sell coal  or if utilities were to have difficulty obtaining financing in connection with coal fired plants  it may make it more costly to operate fossil fuel fired especially coal fired electric power generation plants and make fossil fuels less attractive for electric utility power plants in the future 
depending on the nature of the regulation or legislation  natural gas fueled power generation could become more economically attractive than coal fueled power generation  substantially increasing the demand for natural gas 
apart from actual regulation  uncertainty over the regulation of ghg emissions may inhibit utilities from investing in the building of new coal fired plants to replace older plants or investing in the upgrading of existing coal fired plants 
any reduction in the amount of coal or possibly natural gas consumed by domestic electric power generators as a result of actual or potential regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could decrease demand for our fossil fuels  thereby reducing our revenues and materially and adversely affecting our business and results of operations 
we or our customers may also have to invest in carbon dioxide capture and storage technologies in order to burn coal or natural gas and comply with future ghg emission standards 
in addition  coalbed methane must be expelled from our underground coal mines for mining safety reasons 
coalbed methane has a greater ghg effect than carbon dioxide 
our gas operations capture coalbed methane from our underground coal mines  although some coalbed methane is vented into the atmosphere when the coal is mined 
if regulation of ghg emissions does not exempt the release of coalbed methane  we may have to further reduce our methane emissions  pay higher taxes  incur costs to purchase credits that permit us to continue operations as they now exist at our underground coal mines or perhaps curtail coal production 
the amount of coalbed methane we capture is reported  on a voluntarily basis  to the us department of energy 
we have recorded the amounts we have captured since the early s 
foreign currency fluctuations could adversely affect the competitiveness of our coal abroad 
we compete in international markets against coal produced in other countries 
coal is sold internationally in us dollars 
as a result  mining costs in competing producing countries may be reduced in us dollar terms based on currency exchange rates  providing an advantage to foreign coal producers 
currency fluctuations among countries purchasing and selling coal could adversely affect the competitiveness of our coal in international markets 
our coal mining and natural gas operations are subject to operating risks  which could increase our operating expenses and decrease our production levels which could adversely affect our results of operations 
our coal and gas operations are also subject to hazards and any losses or liabilities we suffer from hazards which occur in our operations may not be fully covered by our insurance policies 
our coal mining operations are predominantly underground mines 
these mines are subject to a number of operating risks that could disrupt operations  decrease production and increase the cost of mining at particular mines for varying lengths of time thereby adversely affecting our operating results 
in addition  if coal production declines  we may not be able to produce sufficient amounts of coal to deliver under our long term coal contracts 
consol energy s inability to satisfy contractual obligations could result in our customers initiating claims against us 
the operating risks that may have a significant impact on our coal operations include variations in thickness of the layer  or seam  of coal  amounts of rock and other natural materials intruding into the coal seam and other geological conditions that could affect the stability of the roof and the side walls of the mine  equipment failures or repairs  fires  explosions or other accidents  weather conditions  and security breaches or terroristic acts 
our exploration for and production of natural gas also involves numerous operating risks 
the cost of drilling  completing and operating our shale gas wells  shallow oil and gas wells and coalbed methane cbm wells is often uncertain  and a number of factors can delay or prevent drilling operations  decrease production and or increase the cost of our gas operations at particular sites for varying lengths of time thereby adversely affecting our operating results 
the operating risks that may have a significant impact on our gas operations include unexpected drilling conditions  title problems  pressure or irregularities in geologic formations  equipment failures or repairs  fires  explosions or other accidents  adverse weather conditions  reductions in natural gas prices  security breaches or terroristic acts  pipeline ruptures  lack of adequate capacity for treatment or disposal of waste water generated in drilling  completion and production operations  environmental contamination from surface spillage of fluids used in well drilling  completion or operation including fracturing fluids used in hydraulic fracturing of wells  or other contamination of groundwater or the environment resulting from our use of such fluids  and unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs  other field services and equipment 
although we maintain insurance for a number of hazards  we may not be insured or fully insured against the losses or liabilities that could arise from a significant accident in our coal or gas operations 
a decrease in the availability or increase in the costs of commodities or capital equipment used in mining operations could decrease our coal production  impact our cost of coal production and decrease our anticipated profitability 
coal mining consumes large quantities of commodities including steel  copper  rubber products and liquid fuels and requires the use of capital equipment 
some commodities  such as steel  are needed to comply with roof control plans required by regulation 
the prices we pay for commodities and capital equipment are strongly impacted by the global market 
a rapid or significant increase in the costs of commodities or capital equipment we use in our operations could impact our mining operations costs because we may have a limited ability to negotiate lower prices  and  in some cases  may not have a ready substitute 
we rely upon third party contractors to provide various field services to our coal and gas operations 
a decrease in the availability of or an increase in the prices charged by third party contractors or failure of third party contractors to provide quality services to us in a timely manner could decrease our production  increase our costs of production  and decrease our anticipated profitability 
we rely upon third party contractors to provide key services to our gas operations 
we contract with third parties for well services  related equipment  and qualified experienced field personnel to drill wells and conduct field operations 
the demand for these field services in the natural gas and oil industry can fluctuate significantly 
higher oil and natural gas prices generally stimulate increased demand causing periodic shortages 
these shortages may lead to escalating prices for drilling equipment  crews and associated supplies  equipment and services 
shortages may lead to poor service and inefficient drilling operations and increase the possibility of accidents due to the hiring of inexperienced personnel and overuse of equipment by contractors 
in addition  the costs and delivery times of equipment and supplies are substantially greater in periods of peak demand 
accordingly  we cannot assure that we will be able to obtain necessary drilling equipment and supplies in a timely manner or on satisfactory terms  and we may experience shortages of  or increases in the costs of  drilling equipment  crews and associated supplies  equipment and field services in the future 
we also use third party contractors to provide construction and specialized services to our mining operations 
a decrease in the availability of field services or equipment and supplies  an increase in the prices charged for field services  equipment and supplies  or the failure of third party contractors to provide quality field services to us  could decrease our coal and gas production  increase our costs of coal and gas production  and decrease our anticipated profitability 
we attempt to mitigate the risks involved with increased industrial activity by entering into take or pay contracts with well service providers which commit them to provide field services to us at specified levels and commit us to pay for field services at specified levels even if we do not use those services 
however  these contracts expose us to economic risk 
for example  if the price of natural gas declines and it is not economical to drill and produce additional natural gas  we may have to pay for field services that we did not use 
this would decrease our cash flow and raise our costs of production 
for mining and drilling operations  consol energy must obtain  maintain  and renew governmental permits and approvals which if we cannot obtain in a timely manner would reduce our production  cash flow and results of operations 
most coal producers in the eastern us are being impacted by government regulations and enforcement to a much greater extent than a few years ago  particularly in light of the renewed focus by environmental agencies and the government generally on the mining industry  including more stringent enforcement and interpretation of the laws that regulate mining 
the pace with which the government issues permits needed for new operations and for on going operations to continue mining has negatively impacted expected production  especially in central appalachia 
environmental groups in southern west virginia and kentucky have challenged state and us army corps of engineers permits for mountaintop and types of surface mining operations on various grounds 
the most recent challenges have focused on the adequacy of the corps of engineers analysis of impacts to streams and the adequacy of mitigation plans to compensate for stream impacts resulting from valley fill permits required for mountaintop mining 
these challenges have also enhanced the epa s oversight and involvement in the review of permits by state regulatory authorities 
in  the us district court for the southern district of west virginia found other operators permits for mining in these areas to be deficient 
in february  the us court of appeals for the fourth circuit reversed that decision  finding that the permits were adequate 
however  since that reversal  the epa began to more critically review valley fill permits and permits for all types of coal mining operations  and has been recommending that a number of permits be denied because of alleged concerns by the epa of potential impacts to water quality in streams below mining operations  with cumulative impacts of mining on watersheds 
the epa s objections and an enhanced review process that was being implemented under a federal multi agency memorandum of understanding effectively held up the issuance of permits for all types of mining operations that require clean water act section discharge permits and section dredge and fill permits  including surface facilities for underground mines 
although a portion of the epa s enhanced review process was invalidated in october  in part because the epa failed to follow public notice and rulemaking requirements  normal permitting has not resumed 
also  the epa may elect to seek to adopt regulations to codify its enhanced review process 
consol energy s surface and underground operations have been impacted to a limited extent to date  but future permits may be delayed if the epa continues to seek to exercise enhanced oversight and involvement in state permit programs 
in addition  the length of time needed to bring a new mine into production has increased by several years because of the increased time required to obtain necessary permits 
these delays or denials of mining permits could reduce our production  cash flow and results of operations 
existing and future government laws  regulations and other legal requirements relating to protection of the environment  and others that govern our business may increase our costs of doing business for both coal and natural gas  and may restrict both our coal and gas operations 
we are subject to laws  regulations and other legal requirements enacted or adopted by federal  state and local  as well as foreign authorities relating to protection of the environment 
these include those legal requirements that govern discharges of substances into the air and water  the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes  the cleanup of contaminated sites  groundwater quality and availability  threatened and endangered plant and wildlife protection  reclamation and restoration of mining or drilling properties after mining or drilling is completed  the installation of various safety equipment in our mines  remediation of impacts of surface subsidence from underground mining  and work practices related to employee health and safety 
complying with these requirements  including the terms of our permits  has had  and will continue to have  a significant effect on our costs of operations and competitive position 
for example  we have agreed to commence operation by may   of a new advanced waste water treatment plant to treat the discharge of mine water from our blacksville  loveridge and robinson run mines at a total estimated cost of approximately million 
in addition  we could incur substantial costs as a result of violations under environmental laws 
any additional laws  regulations and other legal requirements enacted or adopted by federal  state and local  as well as foreign authorities or new interpretations of existing legal requirements by regulatory bodies relating to the protection of the environment matters could further affect our costs of operations and competitive position 
for example  the federal clean water act and corresponding state laws affect coal mining and gas operations by imposing restrictions on discharges into regulated surface waters 
permits requiring regular monitoring and compliance with effluent limitations and reporting requirements govern the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters 
the clean water act federal regulations and corresponding state laws and regulations require permits for discharges from mining and gas operations that include discharge limits that are adequate to protect existing stream uses and aquatic life and  for impaired streams  that are adequate to eliminate the impairment  which may cause consol energy to incur additional costs that could adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and cash flows or may prevent us from being able to mine portions of our reserves 
the clean water act is being used by opponents of mountain top removal mining as a means to challenge permits 
in addition  consol energy incurs and will continue to incur costs associated with the investigation and remediation of environmental contamination under the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act superfund and similar state statutes and has been named as a potentially responsible party at superfund sites in the past 
state and local authorities regulate various aspects of gas drilling and production activities  including the drilling of wells through permit and bonding requirements  the spacing of wells  the unitization or pooling of gas properties  environmental matters  safety standards  market sharing and well site restoration 
if we fail to comply with statutes and regulations  we may be subject to penalties  which would decrease our profitability 
additionally  regulations applicable to the gas industry are under constant review for amendment or expansion at the federal and state level 
any future changes may affect  among other things  the pricing or marketing of gas production 
for example  hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons  particularly natural gas  from tight formations such as marcellus shale 
the process involves the injection of water  sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production 
the process is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions 
hydraulic fracturing is currently exempt from regulation under the federal safe drinking water act  except for hydraulic fracturing using diesel fuel 
the disposal of produced water  drilling fluids and other wastes in underground injection disposal wells is regulated by the epa under the federal safe drinking water act or by the states under counterpart state laws and regulations 
the imposition of new environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on our ability to conduct hydraulic fracturing operations or to dispose of waste resulting from such operations 
the epa has commenced a study of the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities  with initial results of the study anticipated to be available by late and with a final report to be issued in other federal agencies are also examining hydraulic fracturing  including the us department of energy doe  the us government accountability office and the department of the interior 
in addition  legislation has been introduced in congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process 
also  some states have adopted  and other states are considering adopting  regulations that could restrict or impose additional requirements relating to hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances 
if hydraulic fracturing is regulated at the federal level  our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permit requirements or operational restrictions and also to associated permitting delays and potential increases in costs 
further  some state and local governments in the marcellus shale region in pennsylvania and new york have considered or imposed a temporary moratorium on drilling operations using hydraulic fracturing until further study of the potential for environmental and human health impacts by the epa or the relevant agencies are completed 
no assurance can be given as to whether or not similar measures might be considered or implemented in other jurisdictions in which our gas properties are located 
if new laws or regulations that significantly restrict or otherwise impact hydraulic fracturing are passed by congress or adopted in states in which we operate  such legal requirements could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform hydraulic fracturing activities and thereby could affect the determination of whether a well is commercially viable 
new laws or regulations could also cause delays or interruptions or terminations of operations  the extent of which cannot be predicted  and could reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we ultimately are able to produce in commercially paying quantities from our gas properties  all of which could have a material adverse affect on our results of operation and financial condition 
our shale gas drilling and production operations require both adequate sources of water to use in the fracturing process as well as the ability to dispose of water and other wastes after hydraulic fracturing 
our cbm gas drilling and production operations also require the removal and disposal of water from the coal seams from which we produce gas 
if we cannot find adequate sources of water for our use or are unable to dispose of the water we use or remove it from the strata at a reasonable cost and within applicable environmental rules  our ability to produce gas economically and in commercial quantities could be impaired 
as part of our drilling and production in the marcellus shale  we use hydraulic fracturing processes 
thus  we need access to adequate sources of water to use in our marcellus shale operations 
further  we must remove and dispose of the portion of the water that we use to fracture our shale gas wells that flows back to the well bore as well as drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration  development or production of natural gas 
in addition  in our cbm drilling and production  coal seams frequently contain water that must be removed and disposed of in order for the gas to detach from the coal and flow to the well bore 
our inability to locate sufficient amounts of water with respect to our marcellus shale operations  or the inability to dispose of or recycle water and other wastes used in our marcellus shale and our cbm operations  could adversely impact our operations 
for example  in ohio  injection of gas well production fluids was temporarily suspended for underground injection disposal wells near youngstown while regulatory authorities investigate whether injection of wastewater into the wells is causing low category earthquakes in the area 
our mines are subject to stringent federal and state safety regulations that increase our cost of doing business at active operations and may place restrictions on our methods of operation 
in addition  government inspectors under certain circumstances  have the ability to order our operations to be shut down based on safety considerations 
a mine could be shut down for an extended period of time if a disaster were to occur at it 
stringent health and safety standards were imposed by federal legislation when the federal coal mine health and safety act of was adopted 
the federal coal mine safety and health act of expanded the enforcement of safety and health standards of the coal mine health and safety act of and imposed safety and health standards on all non coal as well as coal mining operations 
regulations are comprehensive and affect numerous aspects of mining operations  including training of mine personnel  mining procedures  the equipment used in mine emergency procedures  mine plans and other matters 
the additional requirements of the mine improvement and new emergency response act of the miner act and implementing federal regulations include  among other things  expanded emergency response plans  providing additional quantities of breathable air for emergencies  installation of refuge chambers in underground coal mines  installation of two way communications and tracking systems for underground coal mines  new standards for sealing mined out areas of underground coal mines  more available mine rescue teams and enhanced training for emergencies 
most states in which consol energy operates have programs for mine safety and health regulation and enforcement 
we believe that the combination of federal and state safety and health regulations in the coal mining industry is  perhaps  the most comprehensive system for protection of employee safety and health affecting any industry 
most aspects of mine operations  particularly underground mine operations  are subject to extensive regulation 
the various requirements mandated by law or regulation can place restrictions on our methods of operations  creating a significant effect on operating costs and productivity 
in addition  government inspectors under certain circumstances  have the ability to order our operation to be shut down based on safety considerations 
if a disaster were to occur at one of our mines  it could be shutdown for an extended period of time and our reputation with our customers could be materially damaged 
our operations may impact the environment or cause exposure to hazardous substances  and our properties may have environmental contamination  which could result in liabilities to us 
our operations currently use hazardous materials and generate limited quantities of hazardous wastes from time to time 
drainage flowing from or caused by mining activities can be acidic with elevated levels of dissolved metals  a condition referred to as acid mine drainage 
we could become subject to claims for toxic torts  natural resource damages and other damages as well as for the investigation and clean up of soil  surface water  groundwater  and other media 
such claims may arise  for example  out of conditions at sites that we currently own or operate  as well as at sites that we previously owned or operated  or may acquire 
our liability for such claims may be joint and several  so that we may be held responsible for more than our share of the contamination or other damages  or for the entire share 
we maintain extensive coal refuse areas and slurry impoundments at a number of our mining complexes 
such areas and impoundments are subject to extensive regulation 
our coal refuse areas and slurry impoundments are designed  constructed  and inspected by our company and by regulatory authorities according to stringent environmental and safety standards 
structural failure of a slurry impoundment or coal refuse area could result in extensive damage to the environment and natural resources  such as bodies of water that the coal slurry reaches  as well as liability for related personal injuries and property damages  and injuries to wildlife 
some of our impoundments overlie mined out areas  which can pose a heightened risk of failure and of damages arising out of failure 
if one of our impoundments were to fail  we could be subject to claims for the resulting environmental contamination and associated liability  as well as for fines and penalties 
in west virginia there are areas where drainage from coal mining operations contains concentrations of selenium that without treatment would result in violations of state water quality standards that are set to protect fish and other aquatic life 
consol energy has two operations with selenium discharges 
consol energy and other coal companies are working to expeditiously develop cost effective means to remove selenium from mine water 
if such technology is not developed promptly  the only available effective treatment technologies are expensive to construct and operate which will increase coal production costs 
these and other similar unforeseen impacts that our operations may have on the environment  as well as exposures to hazardous substances or wastes associated with our operations  could result in costs and liabilities that could adversely affect us 
consol energy has reclamation  mine closing and gas well plugging obligations 
if the assumptions underlying our accruals are inaccurate  we could be required to expend greater amounts than anticipated 
the surface mining control and reclamation act establishes operational  reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining as well as most aspects of deep mining 
also  state laws require us to plug gas wells and reclaim well sites after the useful life of our gas wells has ended 
consol energy accrues for the costs of current mine disturbance  gas well plugging and of final mine closure  including the cost of treating mine water discharge where necessary 
estimates of our total reclamation  mine closing liabilities and gas well plugging  which are based upon permit requirements and our experience  were approximately million at december  the amounts recorded are dependent upon a number of variables  including the estimated future closure costs  estimated proven reserves  assumptions involving profit margins  inflation rates  and the assumed credit adjusted risk free interest rates 
furthermore  these obligations are unfunded 
if these accruals are insufficient or our liability in a particular year is greater than currently anticipated  our future operating results could be adversely affected 
most states where we operate require us to post bonds for the full cost of coal mine reclamation full cost bonding 
west virginia is not a full cost bonding state 
west virginia has an alternative bond system abs for coal mine reclamation which consists of i individual site bonds posted by the permittee that are less than the full estimated reclamation cost plus ii a bond pool special reclamation fund funded by a per ton fee on coal mined in the state which is used to supplement the site specific bonds if needed in the event of bond forfeiture 
the special reclamation fund is currently underfunded 
adequacy of the special reclamation fund is an issue in a citizen suit pending in us district court in west virginia 
given these facts  it is likely that funding for the special reclamation fund will be increased to make it solvent through an increase in the per ton fee or from other funding sources  or the state may be forced by the court or the us office of surface mine reclamation and enforcement to convert to full cost bonding 
an increase in the per ton fee may reduce profit margins and or make some operations unprofitable 
conversion to full cost bonding may exceed bonding capacity of individual mining companies and or surety companies that would result in the need to post cash bonds or letters of credit which would reduce operating capital 
consol energy faces uncertainties in estimating our economically recoverable coal and gas reserves  and inaccuracies in our estimates could result in lower than expected revenues  higher than expected costs and decreased profitability 
there are uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of economically recoverable coal reserves  including many factors beyond our control 
as a result  estimates of economically recoverable coal reserves are by their nature uncertain 
information about our reserves consists of estimates based on engineering  economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by our staff 
some of the factors and assumptions which impact economically recoverable coal reserve estimates include geological conditions  historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effects of regulations and taxes by governmental agencies  assumptions governing future prices  and future operating costs  including the cost of materials 
in addition  we hold substantial coal reserves in areas containing marcellus shale and other shales 
these areas are currently the subject of substantial exploration for oil and gas  particularly by horizontal drilling 
if a well is in the path of our mining for coal  we may not be able to mine through the well unless we purchase it 
although in the past we have purchased vertical wells  the cost of purchasing a producing horizontal well could be substantially greater 
horizontal wells with multiple laterals extending from the well pad may access larger oil and gas reserves than a vertical well which could result in higher costs 
in future years  the cost associated with purchasing oil and gas wells which are in the path of our coal mining may make mining through those wells uneconomical thereby effectively causing a loss of significant portions of our coal reserves 
similarly  natural gas reserves require subjective estimates of underground accumulations of natural gas and assumptions concerning natural gas prices  production levels  and operating and development costs 
as a result  estimated quantities of proved gas reserves and projections of future production rates and the timing of development expenditures may be incorrect 
over time  material changes to reserve estimates may be made  taking into account the results of actual drilling  testing and production 
also  we make certain assumptions regarding natural gas prices  production levels  and operating and development costs that may prove incorrect 
any significant variance from these assumptions to actual figures could greatly affect our estimates of our gas reserves  the economically recoverable quantities of natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties  the classifications of gas reserves based on risk of recovery  and estimates of the future net cash flows 
numerous changes over time to the assumptions on which our reserve estimates are based  as described above  often result in the actual quantities of gas we ultimately recover being different from reserve estimates 
the present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is not necessarily the same as the current market value of our estimated natural gas reserves 
we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved gas reserves on historical average prices and costs 
however  actual future net cash flows from our gas and oil properties also will be affected by factors such as geological conditions  changes in governmental regulations and taxation  the amount and timing of actual production  assumptions governing future prices  future operating costs  and capital costs of drilling new wells 
the timing of both our production and our incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of natural gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves  and thus their actual present value 
in addition  the discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the natural gas and oil industry in general 
in addition  if natural gas prices decline by per thousand cubic feet  then the pre tax present value using a discount rate of our proved gas reserves as of december  would decrease from billion to billion 
the standardized generally accepted accounting principle measure associated with this decline of per thousand cubic feet  would be approximately billion 
each of the factors which impacts reserve estimation may in fact vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating the reserves 
for these reasons  estimates of coal and gas reserves may vary substantially 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to our coal and gas reserves will likely vary from estimates  and these variances may be material 
as a result  our estimates may not accurately reflect our actual coal and gas reserves 
we may incur additional costs and delays to produce coal and gas because we have to acquire additional property rights to perfect our title to coal or gas rights 
while chain of title for our coal estate generally has been established  there may be defects in it that we do not realize until we have committed to developing those properties or coal reserves 
as such  the title to the coal estate that we intend to mine may contain defects 
in order to conduct our mining operations on properties where these defects exist  we may incur unanticipated costs perfecting title 
substantial amounts of acreage in which we believe we control gas rights are in areas where we have not yet done a thorough chain of title examination of the gas estate 
a number of our gas properties were acquired primarily for the coal rights with the focus on the coal estate title  and  in many cases were acquired years ago 
in addition  we have acquired gas rights in substantial acreage from third parties who had not performed thorough chain of title work on their gas properties 
our practice  and we believe industry practice  is not to perform a thorough title examination on gas properties until shortly before the commencement of drilling activities at which time we seek to acquire any additional rights needed to perfect our ownership of the gas estate for development and production purposes 
we may incur substantial costs to acquire these additional property rights and the acquisition of the necessary rights may not be feasible in some cases 
our inability to obtain these rights may adversely impact our ability to develop those properties 
some states permit us to produce the gas without perfected ownership under an administrative process known as pooling  which require us to give notice to all potential claimants and pay royalties into escrow until the undetermined rights are resolved 
as a result  we may have to pay royalties to produce gas on acreage that we control and these costs may be material 
further  the pooling process is time consuming and may delay our drilling program in the affected areas 
in confirming title to the gas estate in pennsylvania  we rely upon long standing pennsylvania supreme court decisions 
a recent decision by the intermediate appellate court in pennsylvania in a case captioned butler v 
powers pa 
superior ct  no 
mda did not change the law of pennsylvania  but in remanding the case to the trial court for further proceedings  it called into question the applicability of a long standing presumption known as the dunham rule to gas in the marcellus shale 
the dunham rule is a presumption that a reservation or conveyance of minerals does not transfer the ownership of oil and gas absent an express reference to oil and gas 
while we believe that the pennsylvania courts will ultimately confirm that the dunham rule applies to marcellus shale gas  if the pennsylvania courts were to hold otherwise  we could be exposed to lawsuits challenging our rights to marcellus shale gas in some of our pennsylvania properties where our rights derive from persons who did not also own the mineral rights and we may have to incur substantial additional costs to perfect our gas title in those pennsylvania properties 
our subsidiaries  primarily fairmont supply company  is a co defendant in various asbestos litigation cases which could result in making payments in the future that are material 
one of our subsidiaries  fairmont supply company fairmont  which distributes industrial supplies  currently is named as a defendant in approximately  asbestos claims in state courts in pennsylvania  ohio  west virginia  maryland  new jersey  texas and illinois 
because a very small percentage of products manufactured by third parties and supplied by fairmont in the past may have contained asbestos and many of the pending claims are part of mass complaints filed by hundreds of plaintiffs against a hundred or more defendants  it has been difficult for fairmont to determine how many of the cases actually involve valid claims or plaintiffs who were actually exposed to asbestos containing products supplied by fairmont 
in addition  while fairmont may be entitled to indemnity or contribution in certain jurisdictions from manufacturers of identified products  the availability of such indemnity or contribution is unclear at this time and  in recent years  some of the manufacturers named as defendants in these actions have sought protection from these claims under bankruptcy laws 
fairmont has no insurance coverage with respect to these asbestos cases 
for the year ended december   payments by fairmont with respect to asbestos cases have not been material 
other of our subsidiaries may also have asbestos claims against them 
our current estimates related to these asbestos claims  individually and in the aggregate  are immaterial to the financial position  results of operations and cash flows of consol energy 
however  it is reasonably possible that payments in the future with respect to pending or future asbestos cases may be material to the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of consol energy 
consol energy and its subsidiaries are subject to various legal proceedings  which may have an adverse effect on our business 
we are party to a number of legal proceedings in the normal course of business activities 
defending these actions  especially purported class actions  can be costly  and can distract management 
for example  we are a defendant in five pending purported class action lawsuits dealing with such diverse matters as the propriety of our acquisition of the noncontrolling interest of cnx gas  our right to natural gas production in some areas  and asserting that we are responsible for hurricane katrina and the damage it caused 
there is the potential that the costs of defending litigation in an individual matter or the aggregation of many matters could have an adverse effect on our cash flows  results of operations or financial position 
see note commitments and contingent liabilities in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for further discussion of pending legal proceedings 
consol energy has obligations for long term employee benefits for which we accrue based upon assumptions which  if inaccurate  could result in consol energy being required to expense greater amounts than anticipated 
consol energy provides various long term employee benefits to inactive and retired employees 
we accrue amounts for these obligations 
at december   the current and non current portions of these obligations included postretirement medical and life insurance billion  coal workers black lung benefits million  salaried retirement benefits million  and workers compensation million 
however  if our assumptions are inaccurate  we could be required to expend greater amounts than anticipated 
salary retirement benefits are funded in accordance with employer retirement income security act of erisa regulations 
the other obligations are un funded 
in addition  the federal government and several states in which we operate consider changes in workers compensation and black lung laws from time to time 
such changes  if enacted  could increase our benefit expense 
due to our participation in an underfunded multi employer pension plan  we have exposure under that plan that extends beyond what our obligation would be with respect to our employees and in the future we may have to make additional cash contributions to fund the pension plan or incur withdrawal liability 
certain of our subsidiaries have been contributing to a multi employer defined benefit pension plan pension trust for united mine workers of america umwa retirees under the terms of various national bituminous coal wage agreements nbcwa which those subsidiaries have entered into over the years with the umwa 
the current nbcwa with the umwa became effective july  and expires on december  all assets contributed to the pension trust are pooled and available to provide benefits for all participants and beneficiaries 
as a result  contributions made by our signatory subsidiaries benefit employees of consol energy and of other employers 
for the plan year ended june   approximately of retirees and surviving spouses receiving benefits from the pension trust last worked at signatory subsidiaries of consol energy 
the pension trust is overseen by a board of trustees  consisting of two union appointed trustees and two employer appointed trustees 
the trustees responsibilities include selection of the plan s investment policy  asset allocation  individual investment of plan assets and the administration of the plan 
the benefits provided by the pension trust to the participating employees are determined based on age and years of service at retirement 
the current nbcwa calls for contribution amounts to be paid to the pension trust by our signatory subsidiaries during the term of the nbcwa based principally on hours worked by our umwa represented employees at a contribution rate of per hour 
as of june   the most recent date for which information is available  the pension trust was underfunded 
this determination was made in accordance with employer retirement income security act of erisa calculations  with a total actuarial asset value of billion and a total actuarial accrued liability of billion 
under the pension protection act of pension protection act  a funded percentage of should be maintained for this multi employer pension plan  and if the plan is determined to have a funded percentage of less than it will be deemed to be endangered or seriously endangered if the number of years to reach a projected funding deficiency equals or less and if less than  it will be deemed to be in critical status 
the funded percentage certified by the actuary for the pension trust was determined to be approximately under the pension act 
on october   the signatory subsidiaries of consol energy received notice from the trustees of the pension trust stating that the pension plan is considered to be in seriously endangered status for the plan year beginning july  due to the funded percentage and projected funding deficiency 
as a result  the pension protection act requires the pension trust to adopt a funding improvement plan no later than may   to improve the funded status of the plan  which may include increased contributions to the pension trust from employers in the future 
because the nbcwa established our signatory subsidiaries contribution obligations through december   our signatory subsidiaries contributions to the pension trust should not increase during the term of the nbcwa as a consequence of any funding improvement plan adopted by the pension trust to address the plan s seriously endangered status 
upon expiration of the nbcwa  our signatory subsidiaries could be required to increase contributions to the pension trust in amounts that could be material to our financial position and results of operations or cash flows 
in the event our subsidiaries were to withdraw from the pension trust  consol energy and its subsidiaries would be liable for a proportionate share of such pension plan s unfunded vested benefits  as determined by the plan s actuary 
based on the information available from the pension trust s administrators  we believe that our portion of the contingent liability represented by the plan s unfunded vested benefits  in the case of the withdrawal of our signatory subsidiaries from the plan or in the case of the termination of the plan  would be material to our financial position and results of operations 
as of june  this withdrawal liability was estimated at approximately billion 
in the event that any other contributing employer withdraws from the pension trust and such employer or any member in its controlled group cannot satisfy their obligations under the plan at the time of withdrawal  then we  along with the other remaining contributing employers  would be liable for an increase in our proportionate share of the pension trust s unfunded vested benefits at the time of the withdrawal from the plan or its termination 
if lump sum payments made to retiring salaried employees pursuant to consol energy s defined benefit pension plan exceed the total of the service cost and the interest cost in a plan year  consol energy would need to make an adjustment to operating results equaling the unrecognized actuarial gain or loss resulting from each individual who received a lump sum payment in that year  which may result in an adjustment that could reduce operating results 
consol energy s defined benefit pension plan for salaried employees allows such employees to receive a lump sum distribution for benefits earned up through december  in lieu of annual payments when they retire from consol energy 
employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans for terminations benefits requires that if the lump sum distributions made for a plan year exceed the total of the service cost and interest cost for the plan year  consol energy would need to recognize for that year s results of operations an adjustment equaling the unrecognized actuarial gain or loss resulting from each individual who received a lump sum in that year 
this type of adjustment may result in a reduction in operating results 
acquisitions that we have completed  acquisitions that we may undertake in the future  as well as expanding existing company mines  involve a number of risks  any of which could cause us not to realize the anticipated benefits and to the extent we plan to engage in joint ventures and divestitures  we do not control the timing of these and they may not provide anticipated benefits 
we have completed several acquisitions and investments in the past including the approximately billion dominion acquisition  which closed on april  we also continually seek to grow our business by adding and developing coal and gas reserves through acquisitions and by expanding the production at existing mines and existing gas operations 
if we are unable to successfully integrate the companies  businesses or properties we acquire  we may fail to realize the expected benefits of the acquisition and our profitability may decline and we could experience a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
acquisitions  mine expansion and gas operation expansion involve various inherent risks  including uncertainties in assessing the value  strengths  and potential profitability of  and identifying the extent of all weaknesses  risks  contingent and other liabilities including environmental liabilities of expansion and acquisition opportunities  the potential loss of key customers  management and employees of an acquired business  the ability to achieve identified operating and financial synergies anticipated to result from an expansion or an acquisition opportunity  the potential revision of assumptions regarding gas reserves as we acquire more knowledge by operating an acquired gas business  problems that could arise from the integration of the acquired business  unanticipated changes in business  industry or general economic conditions that affect the assumptions underlying our rationale for pursuing the expansion or the acquisition opportunity  and we may have to assume cleanup or reclamation obligations or other unanticipated liabilities in connection with these acquisitions 
from time to time part of our business and financing plans include entering into joint venture arrangements and the divestiture of certain assets 
however  we do not control the timing of divestitures or joint venture arrangements and delays in entering into divestitures or joint venture arrangements may reduce the benefits from them 
in addition  the terms of divestitures and joint venture arrangements may make a substantial portion of the benefits we anticipate receiving from them to be subject to future matters that we do not control 
we have entered into two significant gas joint ventures 
these joint ventures restrict our operational and corporate flexibility  actions taken by our joint venture partners may materially impact our financial position and results of operation  and we may not realize the benefits we expect to realize from these joint ventures 
in the second half of consol energy  through its principal gas operations subsidiary  cnx gas company llc cnx gas company  entered into joint venture arrangements with noble energy  inc noble energy and hess ohio developments  llc hess regarding our shale gas assets 
we sold a undivided interest in approximately thousand net acres of marcellus shale oil and gas assets to noble energy and a undivided interest in nearly thousand net utica shale acres in ohio 
the following aspects of these joint ventures could materially impact consol energy the development of these properties is subject to the terms of our joint development agreements with these parties and we no longer have the flexibility to control the development of these properties 
for example  the joint development agreements for each of these joint ventures sets forth required capital expenditure programs that each party must participate in unless the parties mutually agree to change such programs or  in certain limited circumstances in the case of the noble energy joint development agreement  a party elects to exercise a non consent right with respect to an entire year 
if we do not timely meet our financial commitments under the respective joint venture agreements  our rights to participate in such joint ventures will be adversely affected and the other parties to the joint ventures may have a right to acquire a share of our interest in such joint ventures proportionate to  and in satisfaction of  our unmet financial obligations 
in addition  each joint venture party has the right to elect to participate in all acreage and other acquisitions in certain defined areas of mutual interest 
each joint development agreement assigns to each party designated areas over which that party will manage and control operations 
we could incur liability as a result of action taken by one of our joint venture partners 
of the approximately billion we anticipate receiving from noble energy  approximately billion depends upon noble energy paying a portion of our share of drilling and development costs for new wells  which we call carried costs 
we entered into a similar transaction with hess ohio developments  llc hess in which approximately million of the total anticipated consideration of million is dependent upon hess paying carried costs 
thus  the benefits we anticipate receiving in the joint ventures depend in part upon the rate at which new wells are drilled and developed in each joint venture  which could fluctuate significantly from period to period 
moreover  the performance of these third party obligations is outside our control 
the inability or failure of a joint venturer to pay its portion of development costs  including our carried costs during the carry period  could increase our costs of operations or result in reduced drilling and production of oil and gas or loss of rights to develop the oil and gas properties held by that joint venture  noble energy s obligation to pay carried costs is suspended if average henry hub natural gas prices fall and remain below per million british thermal units or mmbtu in any three consecutive month period and will remain suspended until average natural gas prices are above mmbtu for three consecutive months 
as a result of this provision  noble energy s obligation to pay carried costs was suspended beginning on december  we cannot predict when this suspension will be lifted and noble energy s obligation to pay the carried costs will resume 
this suspension has the effect of requiring us to incur our entire percent share of the drilling and completion costs for new wells during the suspension period and delaying receipt of a portion of the value we expect to receive in the transaction 
the noble energy joint development agreement prohibits prior to march   unless noble energy consents in its sole discretion  any transfer of our interests in the noble energy joint venture assets or our selling or otherwise transferring control of cnx gas company 
the hess joint development agreement prohibits prior to october   unless hess consents in its sole discretion  any transfer of our interests in the hess joint venture assets 
these restrictions may preclude transactions which could be beneficial to our shareholders 
disputes between us and our joint venture partners may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses  delay or terminate projects and distract our officers and directors from focusing their time and effort on our business 
we may also enter into other joint venture arrangements in the future which could pose risks similar to risks described above 
consol energy s rights plan may have anti takeover effects that may discourage a change of control even if doing so might be beneficial to our stockholders 
on december   consol energy adopted a rights plan which  in certain circumstances  including a person or group acquiring  or the commencement of a tender or exchange offer that would result in a person or group acquiring  beneficial ownership of more than of the outstanding shares of consol energy common stock  would entitle each right holder to receive  upon exercise of the right  shares of consol energy common stock having a value equal to twice the right exercise price 
for example  at an exercise price of per right  each right not otherwise voided would entitle its holders to purchase worth of shares of consol energy common stock for assuming that shares of consol energy common stock had a per share value of at such time  the holder of each right would be entitled to purchase ten shares of consol energy common stock for  or a price of per share  one half of its then market price 
this and other provisions of consol energy s rights plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire consol energy  which could hinder stockholders ability to receive a premium for consol energy stock over the prevailing market prices 
the provisions of our debt agreements and the risks associated with our debt could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as of december   our total indebtedness was approximately billion of which approximately billion was under our senior unsecured notes due april  billion was under our senior unsecured notes due april  million was under our senior notes due  million was under our baltimore port facility revenue bonds due september  million of capitalized leases due through  and million of miscellaneous debt 
the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences  including  but not limited to increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  development of our coal and gas reserves or other general corporate requirements  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and in the coal and gas industries  and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to less leveraged competitors 
our senior secured credit facility and the indentures governing our  and senior unsecured notes limit the incurrence of additional indebtedness unless specified tests or exceptions are met 
in addition  our senior secured credit agreement and the indentures governing our  and senior unsecured notes subject us to financial and or other restrictive covenants 
under our senior secured credit agreement  we must comply with certain financial covenants on a quarterly basis including a minimum interest coverage ratio  a maximum leverage ratio  and a maximum senior secured leverage ratio  as defined 
our senior secured credit agreement and the indentures governing our  and senior unsecured notes impose a number of restrictions upon us  such as restrictions on granting liens on our assets  making investments  paying dividends  selling assets and engaging in acquisitions 
failure by us to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that  if not cured or waived  could have an adverse effect on us 
if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations  we may be forced to sell assets  seek additional capital or seek to restructure or refinance our indebtedness 
these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations 
in the absence of such operating results and resources  we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to sell material assets or operations to attempt to meet our debt service and other obligations 
our senior secured credit agreement and the indentures governing our  and senior unsecured notes restrict our ability to sell assets and use the proceeds from the sales 
we may not be able to consummate those sales or to obtain the proceeds which we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due 
unless we replace our gas reserves  our gas reserves and production will decline  which would adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
producing natural gas reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors 
because total estimated proved reserves include our proved undeveloped reserves at december   production is expected to decline even if those proved undeveloped reserves are developed and the wells produce as expected 
the rate of decline will change if production from our existing wells declines in a different manner than we have estimated and can change under other circumstances 
thus  our future natural gas reserves and production and  therefore  our cash flow and income are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing and exploiting our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves 
we may not be able to develop  find or acquire additional reserves to replace our current and future production at acceptable costs 
our hedging activities may prevent us from benefiting from price increases and may expose us to other risks 
to manage our exposure to fluctuations in the price of natural gas  we enter into hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of our expected production 
as of december   we had hedges on approximately billion cubic feet of our natural gas production  billion cubic feet of our natural gas production  billion cubic feet of our natural gas production  and billion cubic feet of our natural gas production 
to the extent that we engage in hedging activities  we may be prevented from realizing the benefits of price increases above the levels of the hedges 
in addition  such transactions may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances in which our production is less than expected  the counterparties to our contracts fail to perform the contracts  or the creditworthiness of our counterparties or their guarantors is substantially impaired 
if our gas hedges would no longer qualify for hedge accounting  we will be required to mark them to market and recognize the adjustments through current year earnings 
this may result in more volatility in our income in future periods

ebitda is defined as earnings before deducting net interest expense interest expense less interest income  income taxes and depreciation  depletion and amortization 
although ebit and ebitda are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  management believes that they are useful to an investor in evaluating consol energy because they are widely used in the coal industry as measures to evaluate a company s operating performance before debt expense and cash flow 
financial covenants in our credit facility include ratios based on ebitda 
ebit and ebitda do not purport to represent cash generated by operating activities and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
in addition  because ebit and ebitda are not calculated identically by all companies  the presentation here may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
management s discretionary use of funds depicted by ebit and ebitda may be limited by working capital  debt service and capital expenditure requirements  and by restrictions related to legal requirements  commitments and uncertainties 
a reconcilement of ebit and ebitda to financial net income is as follows for the years ended december  net income add interest expense less interest income less interest income included in black lung excise tax refund add income tax expense add loss on debt extinguishment add abandonment of long lived assets earnings before interest and taxes ebit add depreciation  depletion and amortization earnings before interest  taxes and depreciation  depletion and amortization ebitda j for purposes of computing the ratio of earnings to fixed charges  earnings represent income before income taxes plus fixed charges

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general fourth quarter demand for us thermal and metallurgical coal continued to keep pace with the first three quarters of demand for thermal coal from domestic electric generators decreased slightly from the previous year due to decreases in electricity demand and relatively low natural gas prices that have taken some market share from coal generation 
international demand for us coals  however  has exceeded any reduction in demand from domestic electric generators 
total us coal exports are likely to exceed million tons for which is at least million tons higher than levels 
international demand for us thermal coal slowed in the fourth quarter  but total thermal coal exports were almost double levels 
prices for spot coal delivered into europe declined in the fourth quarter due to weak demand related to the economic slowdown and by weather conditions 
prices for export thermal coal remain competitive relative to us thermal coal customers 
longer term fundamentals for thermal coal exports to europe remain favorable as subsidized mining in europe is phased out  nuclear growth plans are curtailed and south african coals are pulled into asian markets 
domestically  coal inventories at electric generators began to grow towards the end of the fourth quarter due to warmer than normal december weather and relatively low natural gas prices 
us electric demand during the fourth quarter of was estimated to be slightly lower than levels due to a relatively mild start to the winter season 
coal inventories at electric utilities in consol energy s traditional markets grew slightly during the fourth quarter but remain below recent years 
metallurgical coal demand for continued the strong pace set earlier this year as world blast furnace output grew an estimated over steel produced from the blast furnace method uses metallurgical coal and drives metallurgical coal demand 
china continues to provide the bulk of the world s blast furnace iron production with almost of world production  an increase of compared to although european steelmakers have shown signs of a slowdown  global production remains strong 
in particular  production in the united states was up almost compared to  supported by a modest rebound in the north american auto sector 
global supply of metallurgical coal began to normalize in the fourth quarter after conditions improved at australian mines impacted by the spring flooding 
international settlement prices have declined since the temporary supply and demand imbalance was resolved  but currently reflect the tight global supply and demand balance for metallurgical coal 
consol energy is well positioned to take advantage of this market with its low cost buchanan low volatile operation  low cost high volatile operations in northern appalachia and mid vol operations set to open in early natural gas markets enjoyed record demand in primarily driven by gas fired electric generation and an increase in industrial consumption 
some of this increase in demand came from electric generators taking advantage of relatively low prices and utilized more natural gas generation 
supply however  has continued to grow at very strong rates due to the abundance of new shale resources 
this supply and demand imbalance is tempered by decreased imports of liquefied natural gas lng and western canadian pipeline gas  as well as increased exports to eastern canada and mexico 
this supply response may not be sufficient to bring the markets into balance and additional downward price pressures could be experienced in longer term rebalancing will be aided by declining conventional production and the shift in drilling towards oil and liquids rich gas plays 
the widespread perception that shale gas production will yield lower and less volatile natural gas prices could spur additional demand as electric generators choose to build additional high efficiency baseload gas power plants 
additional demand will come from the petrochemical industry and developing sources of demand such as more wide scale use of natural gas vehicles 
consol energy continues to believe that natural gas will bring balance to consol energy s portfolio of long lived energy resources 
a failure to return to normal weather patterns could have a negative short term impact on consol energy s natural gas and domestic thermal coal demand 
additionally  uncertainty in the short term economic outlook could lead to a slowing of global economic expansion 
economic uncertainty is currently driven by the european sovereign debt crisis  lingering high us unemployment rates and instability in the middle east oil producing region 
the fundamental long term drivers of consol energy s business remain unchanged as the global demand for low cost  reliable sources of energy and metallurgical coal remain strong in both the developed and developing world 
consol energy engaged in several business and financing transactions in the year ended december  these transactions include the following on october   consol energy s board of directors increased the regular annual dividend by  or per share  to per share 
on october   cnx gas company llc cnx gas company completed a sale to a subsidiary of hess corporation hess of of its nearly thousand net utica shale acres in ohio 
cash proceeds related to this transaction were million  which is net of million of transaction fees 
additionally  consol energy and hess entered into a joint development agreement pursuant to which hess agreed to pay approximately million in the form of a drilling carry of certain consol energy working interest obligations as the acreage is developed 
the net gain on the transaction was million and was recognized in the consolidated statements of income as other income 
on september   cnx gas company completed a sale to noble energy  inc noble of of the company s undivided interest in certain marcellus shale oil and gas properties in west virginia and pennsylvania covering approximately thousand net acres and of the company s undivided interest in certain of its existing marcellus shale wells and related leases 
cash proceeds of million were received related to this transaction  which are net of million transaction fees 
additionally  a note receivable has been recognized related to the two additional cash payments to be received on the first and a second anniversary of the transaction closing date 
the discounted notes receivable of million and million have been recorded in accounts and notes receivables notes receivable and other assets notes receivable  respectively 
subsequent to the transaction  an additional receivable of million and a payable of approximately thousand were recorded for closing adjustments and have been included in accounts and notes receivable other and accounts payable  respectively 
the net loss on the transaction was million and was recognized in the consolidated statements of income as other income 
as part of the transaction  cnx gas company also received a commitment from noble to pay one third of the company s working interest share of certain drilling and completion costs  up to approximately billion with certain restrictions 
these restrictions include the suspension of carry if average natural gas henry hub prices are below per million british thermal units mmbtu for three consecutive months 
the carry will remain suspended until average natural gas prices are above mmbtu for three consecutive months 
restrictions also include a million annual maximum on noble s carried cost obligation 
on september  cnx gas company and noble formed cone gathering llc cone  a joint venture established to develop and operate each company s gas gathering system needs in the marcellus shale play 
cnx gas company s ownership interest in cone is accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
cnx gas contributed its existing marcellus shale gathering infrastructure which had a net book value of million and noble contributed cash of approximately million 
cone made a cash distribution to cnx gas in the amount of million 
the cash proceeds have been recorded as cash inflows of million and million in distributions from equity affiliates and proceeds from the sale of assets  respectively  on the consolidated statements of cash flow 
the gain on the transaction was million and was recognized in the consolidated statements of income as other income 
on september  consol energy entered into an agreement with antero resources appalachian corp 
antero  pursuant to which consol energy assigned to antero overriding royalty interests orri of approximately in approximately thousand net acres of marcellus shale located in nine counties in southwestern pennsylvania and north central west virginia  in exchange for million 
the net gain of million is included in other income in the consolidated statements of income 
consol energy incurred costs of approximately million in the year ended december  related to the solicitation of consents from the holders of consol energy s outstanding senior notes due  senior notes due and senior notes due the consents allowed an amendment to the indentures for each of those notes  clarifying that the transactions such as those contemplated by the august asset acquisition agreements with noble and hess were permissible under those indentures 
in june  the bituminous coal operators association bcoa and the united mine workers of america umwa reached a new collective bargaining agreement which will run from july  to december  that agreement  the national bituminous coal wage agreement of nbcwa  covers approximately  employees of consol energy subsidiaries 
the nbcwa is the successor agreement to the nbcwa that was set to expire on december  key elements of the new agreement include the following items a 
a wage increase of per hour effective july   and an additional per hour increase each january st throughout the contract term 
b 
contributions to the pension plan  a multi employer plan  will continue at the current rate of per hour throughout the contract term 
new inexperienced miners hired after december  will not participate in the pension plan  but will receive a per hour contribution increasing to per hour in to the umwa cash deferred savings plan cdsp  which is a k plan 
umwa represented employees with over years of credited service under the pension plan will receive a per hour contribution increasing to per hour in to the cdsp beginning january  also beginning january   umwa represented employees will have the right to elect to opt out of future participation in the pension plan and upon such election  will receive a per hour contribution increasing to per hour in to the cdsp 
c 
a per hour contribution starting january  to a new defined contribution plan to provide retiree bonus payments to eligible retirees in  and d 
an increased contribution from per hour to per hour effective january  to the benefit plan  which is a defined contribution plan providing health benefits to certain retirees 
e 
various other changes related to absenteeism  contributions to various umwa benefit funds  eligibility for various vacation days and sick days 
in june  consol energy management decided to permanently idle its mine underground facility 
this facility had been on idle status since march various options for the facility were explored  such as selling and operating with continuous miners  but management decided it was in the best interest of the company to abandon the underground workings of this facility and reallocate resources into more profitable coal operations and marcellus shale drilling operations 
the company redeployed all of the movable equipment from the mine that could be used at other locations 
the abandonment of this underground facility resulted in a million charge to pre tax earnings 
see note property  plant and equipment in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for additional disclosure 
the company expects the closure of mine to result in pre tax cash savings of million per year 
in april  cnx gas entered into an amendment to its senior secured credit agreement which increases the availability under the agreement from million to billion  decreases the interest rate and extends the term from may  to april  the amended credit agreement continues to be secured by substantially all of the assets of cnx gas and its subsidiaries 
in april  consol energy amended and extended its existing billion senior secured credit agreement  which decreases the interest rate and extends the term from may  to april  the amended agreement continues to be secured by substantially all of the assets of consol energy and certain of its subsidiaries 
on march   consol energy issued million of senior notes due march the notes are guaranteed by substantially all of the company s existing and future wholly owned domestic restricted subsidiaries 
the company issued the notes with the intention of using the net proceeds to repay its outstanding senior secured notes due march   on or before their maturity 
on april   consol energy redeemed all of its outstanding million  senior secured notes due march  in accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the notes 
by using the proceeds of the million  senior notes due march to effect this redemption  the company effectively extended the maturity of the million of long term indebtedness by nine years at a lower interest rate 
the redemption price included principal of million  a make whole premium of million and accrued interest of million  for a total redemption cost of approximately million 
the loss on extinguishment of debt was approximately million  which primarily represents the interest that would have been paid on these notes if they had been held to maturity 
consol energy is managing several significant matters that may affect our business and impact our financial results in the future including the following challenges in the overall environment in which we operate create increased risks that we must continuously monitor and manage 
these risks include i increased prices for commodities such as diesel fuel  synthetic rubber and steel that we use in our operations and ii increased scrutiny of existing safety regulations and the development of new safety regulations 
federal and state environmental regulators are reviewing our operations more closely and more strictly interpreting and enforcing existing environmental laws and regulations  resulting in increased costs and delays 
for example  we entered into a consent decree with the us environmental protection agency and the west virginia department of environmental protection pursuant to which we agreed to construct an advanced technology mine water treatment plant and related facilities to reduce high levels of total dissolved solids in water discharges from certain of our mines in northern west virginia  at a total estimated cost of approximately million 
federal and state regulators have proposed regulations which  if adopted  would adversely impact our business 
these proposed regulations could require significant changes in the manner in which we operate and or would increase the cost of our operations 
for example  the department of interior  office of surface mining reclamation and enforcement osm is currently preparing an environmental impact statement relating to osm s consideration of five alternatives for amending its coal mining stream protection rules 
all of the alternatives  except the no action alternative  could make it more costly to mine our coal and or could eliminate the ability to mine some of our coal 
further  other regulations would make it more expensive for our customers to operate their businesses  possibly inducing them to move to alternative fuel sources 
for example  the epa has issued a proposed rule that would regulate coal combustion residuals from coal fired electric generating facilities under the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra as either a hazardous waste under subtitle c of rcra or as a non hazardous waste under subtitle d of rcra 
if final rules are adopted consistent with either of the proposed alternatives  the cost of handling and disposal of coal combustion residuals could increase making it more expensive to generate electricity from coal 
another example is the cross state air pollution rule csapr that was finalized by the epa on july   although the effective date of the rule has been stayed by a court 
csapr replaces the clean air interstate rule and regulates the amount of so 

and nox that power plants in eastern states can emit in order to meet clean air requirements in downwind states 
another example is the mercury and air toxic standards issued by the epa on december  the new regulations  which will be published in february  set mercury and air toxic standards for new and existing coal and oil fired electric utility steam generating units and include more stringent new source performance standards nsps for particulate matter pm  so and nox 
some older coal fired power plants may be retired or have operation time reduced rather than install additional expensive emission controls which could reduce the amount of coal consumed 
on april   the pennsylvania department of environmental protection announced its intent to not renew permits for publicly owned treatment works potw that treat municipal wastewater to accept wastewater from marcellus shale operators 
they called on operators to cease delivering wastewater to the potws by may  consol energy has implemented a re cycle and re use process of its marcellus derived water for hydraulic fracturing operations  and will only safely dispose of marcellus wastewater in regulated  underground injection control wells 
consol energy continues to explore potential sales of non core assets 
results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  net income attributable to consol energy shareholders consol energy reported net income attributable to consol energy shareholders of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  net income attributable to consol energy shareholders was million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  the coal division includes thermal coal  high volatile metallurgical coal  low volatile metallurgical coal and other coal 
the total coal division contributed million of earnings before income tax for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the total coal division sold million tons of coal produced from consol energy mines  excluding our portion of tons sold from equity affiliates  for the year ended december  compared to million tons for the year ended december  the average sales price and average costs per ton for all active coal operations were as follows for the years ended december  variance percent change average sales price per ton sold average costs per ton sold margin the higher average sales price per ton sold reflects successful re negotiation of several domestic thermal contracts whose pricing took effect january   another strong quarter of high volatile metallurgical coal sales and demand for our premium low volatile metallurgical coal 
also  million tons were priced on the export market at an average sales price of per ton for the year ended december  compared to million tons at an average price of per ton for the year ended december  average costs per ton sold increased per ton in the period to period comparison due primarily to the following operating supplies and maintenance costs per ton sold were higher due to increased equipment overhauls  additional roof control and additional equipment maintenance 
depreciation  depletion and amortization increased due to additional assets placed into service after the period 
labor and labor related charges increased as a result of additional employees  increased overtime hours worked and the impact of the per hour worked umwa contract wage increases  per hour worked related to the prior umwa contract and per hour worked related to the july umwa contract 
other post employment benefits and pension expenses increased primarily due to changes in discount rates  employees retiring sooner than originally anticipated and higher average claim costs 
royalties and production related taxes increased due to higher sales price of coal sold 
the total gas division includes coalbed methane cbm  shallow oil and gas  marcellus and other gas 
the total gas division contributed million of earnings before income tax for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  total gas production was billion net cubic feet for the year ended december  compared to billion net cubic feet for the year ended december  total gas production increased primarily due to the on going drilling program partially offset by billion net cubic feet of production related to the noble joint venture 
the average sales price and average costs for all active gas operations were as follows for the years ended december  variance percent change average sales price per thousand cubic feet sold average costs per thousand cubic feet sold margin total gas division outside sales revenues were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to increase in volumes sold partially offset by the reduction in average price per thousand cubic feet sold 
the volume increase was primarily due to additional wells drilled under the on going drilling program  and additional volumes from the wells purchased in the dominion acquisition  which occurred on april  offset  in part  by the impact of the noble joint venture which reduced volumes by approximately billion net cubic feet 
the decrease in average sales price is the result of various gas swap transactions that occurred throughout both periods and lower average market prices 
the gas swap transactions qualify as financial cash flow hedges that exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions 
these financial hedges represented approximately billion cubic feet of our produced gas sales volumes for the year ended december  at an average price of per thousand cubic feet 
these financial hedges represented billion cubic feet of our produced gas sales volumes for the year ended december  at an average price of per thousand cubic feet 
total gas unit costs decreased slightly for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily due to lower depreciation  depletion and amortization and lower gathering costs partially offset by increased lifting costs 
the wells purchased in the dominion acquisition increased total operating costs by per thousand cubic feet due to higher costs and lower volumes produced related to the age of these wells compared to the legacy consol energy wells 
excluding the impact of these purchased wells  unit costs improved per thousand cubic feet primarily due to the additional volumes produced  improved depreciation  depletion and amortization and lower gathering charges 
volumes increased in the period to period comparison due to the on going drilling program and the additional volumes from the wells purchased in the dominion acquisition partially offset by the impact of the noble joint venture 
lower depreciation  depletion and amortization rates were the result of additional gas reserves recognized at december  gathering and compression charges were improved primarily due to a fuel surcharge reduction by a utility provider 
lifting costs increased in the period to period comparison due to additional well services to maintain production levels 
the other segment includes industrial supplies activity  terminal  river and dock service activity  income taxes and other business activities not assigned to the coal or gas segment 
included in both coal and gas unit costs are selling  general and administrative expenses and total company long term liabilities  such as other post employment benefits opeb  the salary retirement plan  workers compensation and long term disability 
total company selling  general and administrative expenses are allocated to various segments primarily based on revenue and capital expenditure projections between coal and gas as a percent of total 
total company selling  general and administrative expenses were made up of the following items for the years ended december  variance percent change employee wages and related expenses demurrage advertising and promotion contributions commissions consulting and professional services miscellaneous total company selling  general and administrative expenses total company selling  general and administrative expenses increased due to the following employee wages and related expenses increased million which was primarily attributable to the support staff retained in the dominion acquisition and additional hiring of support staff in the period to period comparison 
demurrage charges were higher in the period due to increased export traffic at the baltimore terminal 
advertising and promotion expense increased million in the period to period comparison due to additional campaigns initiated in the period 
contributions expense increased million due to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods  none of which were individually material 
commission expense increased million due to the increase in average sales price and additional tons sold for which a third party was owed a commission in the period to period comparison 
consulting and professional services increased million due to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods  none of which were individually material 
miscellaneous selling  general and administrative expenses increased million due to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods  none of which were individually material 
total company long term liabilities  such as other post employment benefits opeb  the salary retirement plan  workers compensation and long term disability are actuarially calculated for the company as a whole 
the expenses are then allocated to operational units based on active employee counts or active salary dollars 
total consol energy expense related to our actuarial calculated liabilities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million was due primarily to opeb and salary pension expense 
the additional opeb and salary pension expense related to changes in discount rates  employees retiring sooner than originally anticipated and higher average claim costs

the equity in earnings of affiliates is insignificant to the total segment activity 
operating costs are comprised of labor  supplies  maintenance  subsidence  taxes other than income and preparation plant charges related to the extraction and sale of coal 
these costs are reviewed regularly by management and are considered to be the direct responsibility of mine management 
operating costs related to the thermal coal segment were  million for the year ended december  compared to  million for the year ended december  operating costs related to the thermal coal segment decreased primarily due to lower volumes sold partially offset by higher average costs per ton sold 
changes in the average operating costs per ton for thermal coal sold were also related to the following items average operating supplies and maintenance costs per thermal ton sold increased due to additional maintenance and equipment overhaul costs  additional roof control costs  and increased fuel and lubricants 
additional maintenance and equipment overhaul costs are related to additional equipment being serviced in the current period 
additional roof control costs resulted from changes in roof support strategy  such as using longer roof bolts and additional types of roof support  in order to improve the safety of our mines and to provide a more reliable source of production for our customers 
increased fuel and lubricant costs are related to higher fuel prices in the current period 
labor and related benefits were impaired on a cost per thermal ton sold basis due to higher costs and lower volumes sold 
higher benefit costs were due primarily to contributions made to the pension trust the trust  which is a multiemployer pension plan 
contributions to the trust were negotiated under the national bituminous coal wage agreement and are based on a rate per hour worked by members of the united mine workers of america umwa 
the contribution rate increased per hour worked in the period compared to the period 
non represented benefit rates for active employees also increased as a result of continued increases in healthcare costs 
labor and related benefits also increased due to additional employees and the impact of the wage increases of per hour worked  per hour worked effective january  under the previous collective bargaining agreement and per hour worked effective july  related to the july collective bargaining agreement 
these increases were offset  in part  as a result of the tax relief and health care act of authorizing general fund revenues and expanding transfers of interest from the abandoned mine land trust fund to cover orphan retirees which remain in the combined fund  the benefit plan and the plan 
the additional federal funding eliminated the funding of orphan retirees by participating active employers of the plans  resulting in lower expense in the period to period comparison 
the additional federal funding does not impact the amount of contributions required to be paid for our assigned retirees 
also  we may be required to make additional payments in the future to these plans in the event the federal contributions are not sufficient to cover the benefits 
production taxes average cost per thermal ton sold increased primarily due to the per ton higher average sales price 
average operating costs per thermal ton sold increased due to lower tons sold resulting in fixed costs being allocated over less tons resulting in higher unit costs 
provision costs are made up of the expenses related to the company s long term liabilities  such as other post employment benefits opeb  the salary retirement plan  workers compensation  long term disability and accretion on mine closing and related liabilities 
with the exception of accretion expense on mine closing and related liabilities  these liabilities are actuarially calculated for the company as a whole 
the expenses are then allocated to operational units based on active employee counts or active salary dollars 
accretion is calculated on a mine by mine basis 
provision costs attributable to the thermal coal segment were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increased thermal coal provision expense was attributable to the total company increase in long term liability expense discussed in the total company results of operations section 
thermal coal accretion expense related to mine closing and related liabilities remained consistent in the period to period comparison 
selling  administrative and other costs attributable to the thermal coal segment include selling  general and administrative expenses and direct administrative costs 
selling  general and administrative costs  excluding commission expense  are allocated to various segments based on a combination of estimated time worked by various support groups and operating costs incurred at the mine 
commission expense  which is a component of selling  is charged directly to the mine incurring the cost 
direct administrative costs are associated directly with the coal division of the business and are allocated to various mines based on a combination of estimated time worked and production 
selling  administrative and other costs related to the thermal coal segment were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the cost increases attributable to the thermal coal segment were attributable to higher selling  general and administrative expenses as discussed in the total company results of operations section and higher direct administrative costs 
higher direct administrative costs were primarily due to higher employee related expenses due to additional support staff requirements  increased safety reward expense and increased coal sampling charges in the period to period comparison 
these higher costs and lower sales volumes resulted in a per ton increase in average cost per ton sold 
depreciation  depletion and amortization for the thermal coal segment was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to additional equipment and infrastructure placed into service after the period that was depreciated on a straight line basis 
the increase was also due to higher units of production rates for thermal coal mines due to additional air shafts being placed into service after the period which had higher unit rates than historical shafts put into service 
these higher expenses and lower sales tons  resulted in a increase in average costs per ton sold

costs included in the exploration and other cost line are detailed as follows for the years ended december  variance percent change dry hole and lease expiration costs exploration total exploration and other costs other corporate expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase in the period to period comparison was made up of the following items for the years ended december  variance percent change unutilized firm transportation contract buyout bank fees stock based compensation short term incentive compensation variable interest earnings legal fees other total other corporate expenses unutilized firm transportation represents pipeline transportation capacity that the gas segment has obtained to enable gas production to flow uninterrupted as the gas operations continue to increase sales volumes 
contract buyout represents the cancellation of a drilling arrangement with a third party well driller 
bank fees were higher in the period to period comparison due to amending and extending the revolving credit facility related to the gas segment 
in april  the facility was amended to allow billion of borrowings and was extended to april  stock based compensation was higher in the period to period comparison primarily due to the increased allocation from consol energy as a result of the dominion acquisition as well as an increase in total consol energy stock based compensation expense 
stock based compensation costs are allocated to the gas segment based on revenue and capital expenditure projections between coal and gas 
the short term incentive compensation program is designed to increase compensation to eligible employees when cnx gas reaches predetermined targets for safety  production and unit costs 
short term incentive compensation increased in the period to period comparison as the result of exceeding the targets in the period  increased number of employees  and an increased allocation of expense from consol energy as the result of exceeding corporate targets 
variable interest earnings are related to various adjustments a third party entity has reflected in its financial statements 
consol energy holds no ownership interest and during the period de consolidated the impact of this third party due to the cancellation of the drilling arrangement 
based on analysis  during the time consol energy guaranteed the bank loans the entity held  it was determined that conol energy was the primary beneficiary 
therefore  the entity was fully consolidated and the earnings impact was fully reversed in the non controlling interest line discussed below 
legal fees for the period were related to the special committee formed during the cnx gas take in transaction and also represent legal fees related to the shareholder litigation related to this transaction 
other corporate related expense remained consistent in the period to period comparison 
interest expense related to the other gas segment was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  interest was incurred by the other gas segment on the cnx gas revolving credit facility  a capital lease and debt held by a variable interest entity 
the million increase was primarily due to higher levels of borrowings on the revolving credit facility in the period to period comparison 
noncontrolling interest represents of the earnings impact of a third party which has been determined to be a variable interest entity  in which consol energy held no ownership interest  but was the primary beneficiary 
the consol energy gas division was determined to be the primary beneficiary due to guarantees of the third party s bank debt related to their purchase of drilling rigs 
the third party entity provides drilling services primarily to the consol energy gas division 
consol energy consolidates the entity and then reflects of the impact as noncontrolling interest 
the consolidation did not significantly impact any amounts reflected in the gas division income statement 
the variance in the noncontrolling amounts reflects the third party s variance in earnings in the period to period comparison 
in the year ended december   the drilling services contract was bought out 
subsequent to this transaction  the noncontrolling interest was de consolidated 
other segment analysis for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the other segment includes activity from the sales of industrial supplies  the transportation operations and various other corporate activities that are not allocated to the coal or gas segment 
the other segment had a loss before income tax of million for the year ended december  compared to a loss before income tax of million for the year ended december  the other segment also includes total company income tax expense of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  for the years ended december  variance percent change sales outside other income total revenue cost of goods sold and other charges depreciation  depletion amortization taxes other than income tax interest expense total costs loss before income tax income tax net loss industrial supplies total revenue from industrial supplies was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was related to higher sales volumes 
total costs related to industrial supply sales were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million was primarily related to higher sales volumes and changes in last in  first out inventory valuations 
transportation operations total revenue from transportation operations was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million was primarily attributable to additional through put tons at the baltimore terminal in the period to period comparison 
total costs related to the transportation operations were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million was related to the additional through put tons handled by the operations and additional repairs and maintenance costs to maintain the baltimore terminal facilities 
miscellaneous other additional other income of million was recognized for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the million decrease was primarily due to million related to the successful resolution of an outstanding tax issue with the canadian revenue authority for the years through in which consol energy was entitled to interest on a tax refund  million lower equity in earnings of affiliates in the current period compared to the prior year period and million related to various transactions that have occurred throughout both periods  none of which were individually material 
other corporate costs in the other segment include interest expense  transaction and financing fees and various other miscellaneous corporate charges 
total other costs were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  other corporate costs increased due to the following items for the years ended december  variance interest expense loss on extinguishment of debt evaluation fees for non core asset dispositions bank fees transaction and financing fees other interest expense increased million primarily due to interest expense on the long term bonds that were issued in conjunction with the dominion acquisition in april on april   consol energy redeemed all of its outstanding million  senior secured notes due march  in accordance with the terms of the indenture governing these notes 
the redemption price included principal of million  a make whole premium of million and accrued interest of million for a total redemption cost of million 
the loss on extinguishment of debt was million  which primarily represented the interest that would have been paid on these notes if held to maturity 
evaluation fees for non core asset dispositions increased million in the period to period comparison due to various corporate initiatives that began in the period 
bank fees increased million in the period to period comparison due to the refinancing and extension of the previous billion credit facility to billion on april  transaction and financing fees of million were incurred in the year ended december  related to the solicitation of consents of the long term bonds needed in order to clarify the indentures that relate to joint arrangements with respect to consol energy s oil and gas properties 
transaction and financing fees of million were incurred in the year ended december  primarily related to the dominion acquisition  as well as the equity and debt issuance that raised approximately billion 
various other corporate expenses were million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  the decrease of million was due to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods  none of which were individually material 
income taxes the effective income tax rate was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in the effective tax rate for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily attributable to various discrete transactions that occurred in both periods 
the discrete transactions included an internal revenue service audit settlement for years and and the corresponding impacts to the previously accrued tax positions which resulted in higher percentage depletion deductions 
discrete transactions also included the reversal of a valuation allowance for certain state net operating loss carryforwards and future temporary deductions as well as the reversal of certain uncertain tax positions

for the years ended december  variance percent change total company earnings before income tax income tax expense effective income tax rate results of operations year ended december  compared with the year ended december  net income attributable to consol energy shareholders consol energy reported net income attributable to consol energy shareholders of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  net income attributable to consol energy shareholders was million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  see below for a detailed explanation by segment of the variance incurred in the period to period comparison 
the total coal segment includes thermal coal  high volatile metallurgical coal  low volatile metallurgical coal and other coal 
the total coal segment contributed million of earnings before income tax for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the total coal segment sold million tons of coal produced from consol energy mines  excluding our portion of tons sold from equity affiliates  in the year ended december  compared to million tons in the year ended december  the average sales price and total costs per ton for all active coal operations were as follows year ended december  variance percent change average sales price per ton sold average costs per ton sold margin the higher average sales price per ton sold reflects an additional million tons of low volatile metallurgical coal and million tons of high volatile metallurgical coal sold in compared to the low volatile metallurgical coal segment also had a higher average sales price in compared to reflecting the strengthening of the global steel market and steel related products 
the high volatile metallurgical coal global market allowed approximately million tons of coal to be sold as a metallurgical product at an average sales price of per ton 
this coal historically would have been sold on the thermal market where our average price for was per ton 
average costs per ton of coal sold have increased in the period to period comparison due primarily to additional labor  higher supply and maintenance costs  and increased other costs which are directly related to the higher sales prices received for tons sold 
additional labor costs per ton are related to the net addition of approximately employees 
the additional labor was attributed to the shoemaker mine resuming production in after being idled throughout to complete the replacement of the track haulage system to a more efficient belt haulage system 
additional labor was also added in order to run our mines more safely  to prepare for the expected retirement of a significant portion of our work force over the next five years  and to keep the development of the longwall panels ahead of longwall advancement 
additional supply costs were attributable to compliance with new safety regulations such as fire retardant belts  additional equipment maintenance and various changes in roof control measures 
costs directly related to the price received for coal sales have also increased 
these costs include royalty expenses and various production taxes 
the total gas segment includes coalbed methane cbm  conventional  marcellus and other gas 
the total gas segment contributed million of earnings before income tax for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  total gas production was billion cubic feet for the year ended december  compared to billion cubic feet for the year ended december  the average sales price and total costs for all active gas operations were as follows year ended december  variance percent change average sales price per thousand cubic feet sold average costs per thousand cubic feet sold margin total gas segment outside sales revenues were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the increase in volumes sold  offset  in part  by the reduction in average price per thousand cubic feet sold 
the decrease in average sales price is the result of various gas swap transactions that occurred throughout both periods 
these gas swap transactions qualify as financial cash flow hedges that exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions 
these financial hedges represented approximately billion cubic feet of our produced gas sales volumes for the year ended december  at an average price of per thousand cubic feet 
these financial hedges represented approximately billion cubic feet of our produced gas sales volumes for the year ended december  at an average price of per thousand cubic feet 
average gas sales prices excluding the impact of hedging were up slightly in the period to period comparison 
total gas unit costs increased for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily due to the impact of the higher cost structure of the producing wells purchased in the dominion acquisition 
these wells increased total operating costs by per thousand cubic feet due to the higher maintenance costs  higher gathering and transportation costs and lower volumes produced compared to the legacy consol energy wells 
excluding the impact of these purchased wells  unit costs improved per thousand cubic feet primarily due to the additional volumes produced 
volumes increased in the period to period comparison due to the on going drilling program and the additional volumes from the wells purchased in the dominion acquisition 
the other segment includes industrial supplies activity  terminal and river service activity  income taxes and other business activities not assigned to the coal or gas segment 
total coal segment analysis for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the coal segment contributed million of earnings before income tax in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  variances by the individual coal segments are discussed below 
for the year ended difference to year ended december  december  steam coal high vol met coal low vol met coal other coal total coal steam coal high vol met coal low vol met coal other coal total coal sales produced coal purchased coal total outside sales freight revenue other income total revenue and other income costs and expenses total operating costs total provisions total selling  administrative other costs depreciation  depletion and amortization total costs and expenses freight expense total costs earnings loss before income taxes thermal coal segment the thermal coal segment contributed million to total company earnings before income tax in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  the thermal coal revenue and cost components on a per unit basis are as follows for the year ended december  variance percent change produced thermal tons sold in millions average sales price per thermal ton sold average operating costs per thermal ton sold average provision costs per thermal ton sold average selling  administrative and other costs per thermal ton sold average depreciation  depletion and amortization costs per thermal ton sold total average costs per thermal ton sold margin per thermal ton sold thermal coal revenue was  million for the year ended december  compared to  million for the year ended december  the million decrease was attributable to an average sales price reduction of per ton partially offset by a million increase in tons sold 
thermal coal average sales price is lower in the period compared to the period as a result of higher average sales price mines  such as bailey and enlow fork  selling coal in the high volatile metallurgical coal market instead of the thermal coal market 
this impacted the thermal coal segment as a result of leaving more tons sold from lower sales price mines 
this has negatively impacted the average sales price on the thermal coal segment  although total company revenue has improved 
produced thermal inventory was million tons at december  compared to million tons at december  thermal sales tons were higher in the period to period comparison primarily due to the shoemaker mine restarting production in early after being idled throughout to complete the replacement of the track haulage system 
thermal sales tons were also higher as the result of the blacksville mine being idled for several months in in order to manage inventory levels in response to the economic crisis experienced 
blacksville mine has operated throughout these increases were offset  in part  due to selling million tons on the high volatile metallurgical coal market at approximately per ton higher average sales price 
other income attributable to the thermal coal segment represents earnings from our equity affiliate that operates a thermal coal mine 
the equity in earnings of affiliates is insignificant to the total segment activity 
operating costs are made up of labor  supplies  maintenance  subsidence  taxes other than income  royalties and preparation plant charges related to the extraction and sale of coal 
these costs are reviewed regularly by management and are considered to be the direct responsibility of mine management 
operating costs related to the thermal coal segment were  million for the year ended december  compared to  million for the year ended december  higher operating costs in the period to period comparison are due to the per ton increase in average unit costs of tons sold and million of additional tons sold 
higher average operating costs per unit for thermal coal tons sold are primarily related to the following items thermal coal unit costs were higher in as a result of lower cost mines  such as bailey and enlow fork  selling coal in the high volatile metallurgical coal market 
this impacted the thermal coal segment due to increased tons sold from higher cost mines 
labor costs increased due to the effects of wage increases at the union mines from the current labor contracts 
the contracts call for specified hourly wage increases in each year of the contract 
labor costs also increased due to the effects of wage increases at the non represented mines 
average employee counts also increased approximately at our active mining operations 
the additional employees were primarily due to the shoemaker mine resuming production in after being idled during to complete the replacement of the track haulage system to a more efficient belt haulage system 
additional employees were also added in order to run our mines more safely  to prepare for the expected retirement of a significant portion of our work force over the next five years  and to keep the development of the longwall panels ahead of longwall advancement 
health and retirement costs related to the active hourly work force increased due to higher contributions to the multiemployer pension trust that are required under the national bituminous coal wage agreement 
the contribution rate increased from per hour worked by members of the united mine workers union of america umwa in the year ended december  to per hour worked in the year ended december  contributions to the multiemployer plan are expensed as incurred 
health and retirement costs have also increased in the period to period comparison due to higher medical costs for the active hourly work force 
power costs increased due to higher rates charged by utility companies and increased usage in the period to period comparison 
operating costs also increased as a result of the million ton decrease in inventory levels 
the increases in average unit costs of thermal coal sold were offset  in part  by the following reduced contract mining fees due to fewer contractors being retained to mine our reserves in the year ended december  compared to the period 
average operating costs per thermal ton sold decreased due to higher tons sold 
fixed costs are allocated over higher tons resulting in decreased unit costs 
total consol energy expenses related to our actuarial liabilities were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million was due primarily to changes in the discount rates used at the measurement date  which is december  and changes in assumptions which affect the amount of actuarial gains and losses amortized into earnings 
see note pension and other postretirement benefits plans and note coal workers pneumoconiosis cwp and workers compensation in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for additional detail regarding total company expense 
total provisions are made up of the expenses related to the company s long term liabilities  such as other post employment benefits opeb  the salary retirement plan  workers compensation  long term disability and accretion expense on mine closing and related liabilities 
with the exception of accretion expense on mine closing and related liabilities  these expenses are actuarially calculated for the company as a whole 
the expenses are then allocated to operational units based on active employee counts or active salary dollars 
accretion is calculated on a mine by mine basis 
provisions attributable to the thermal coal segment were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  provision costs per thermal coal ton sold increased per ton in the period to period comparison due primarily to higher actuarial expenses  such as opeb  as discussed above 
the overall increase in company costs has increased the total dollars allocated to the thermal coal segment 
this increase was offset  in part  by additional tons sold by the thermal coal segment 
total company selling  general and administrative expenses were made up of the following items for the year ended december  variance percent change employee wages and related expenses commissions miscellaneous total company selling  general and administrative expenses employee wages and related expenses have increased due to additional employees in the selling  general and administrative area primarily related to support staff retained in the dominion acquisition which occurred on april  and additional hiring to support operations 
increased employee wages and related expenses are also related to additional actuarial expenses discussed above 
commission expenses increased million due to additional tons for which a third party was owed a commission compared to the prior year period 
miscellaneous expenses have increased approximately million 
the increase was related to an additional million for advertising and promotion fees  an additional million for demurrage charges and an additional million for various other items  none of which were individually material 
total administrative and other costs related to the thermal coal segment were million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  selling  general and administrative costs  excluding selling expense  are allocated to all segments based on a combination of estimated time worked by various support groups and operating costs incurred by the individual segments 
commission expense  which is a component of selling  is charged directly to the mine incurring the cost 
direct administrative costs are associated directly with the coal division of the business and are allocated to various mines based on a combination of estimated time worked and production 
although the total company selling  general and administrative costs have increased  as discussed above  the amount allocated to the thermal coal segment has decreased approximately million 
the decrease in the amount allocated to the thermal coal segment is primarily related to the high volatile metallurgical coal segment 
in  these tons and the associated allocation were all included in the thermal coal segment 
depreciation  depletion and amortization costs for the thermal coal segment were million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the increase of million  or per ton  was due to additional equipment and infrastructure placed into service after  offset  in part  by additional volumes sold 
high vol metallurgical coal segment the high volatile metallurgical coal segment contributed million to total company earnings before income tax for the year ended december  there was no activity in this segment in the prior year 
this is a new market that was developed in and is primarily related to selling our pittsburgh coal into overseas metallurgical coal markets 
this coal had historically supplied the domestic thermal coal market 
the high volatile metallurgical coal revenue and cost components on a per unit basis are as follows for the year ended december  variance percent change produced high vol met tons sold in millions average sales price per high vol met ton sold average operating costs per high vol met ton sold average provision costs per high vol met ton sold average selling  administrative and other costs per high vol met ton sold average depreciation  depletion and amortization costs per high vol met ton sold total average costs per high vol met ton sold margin per high vol met ton sold the high volatile metallurgical coal segment revenue was million  or an average sales price per ton of  for the year ended december  strength in the metallurgical coal market allowed for the export of northern appalachian coal  historically sold domestically on the thermal coal market  to crossover to the metallurgical coal markets in brazil and asia 
total costs per ton sold of this coal were generating a margin of per ton sold 
this margin exceeds the per ton average margin received on thermal coal sold in which is where this coal would have been historically sold 
other income attributable to the high volatile metallurgical coal segment represents earnings from our equity affiliates that operate mines that sell coal on the high volatile metallurgical coal market 
the equity in earnings of affiliates is insignificant to the total segment activity 
low vol metallurgical coal segment the low volatile metallurgical coal segment contributed million to total company earnings before income tax for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to the buchanan mine being idled for approximately five months of the mine was idled in in response to the economic crisis which significantly lowered the demand for low volatile metallurgical coal  primarily due to the decrease in steel demand 
the buchanan mine has operated throughout all of the low volatile metallurgical coal revenue and cost components on a per unit basis are as follows for the year ended december  variance percent change produced low vol met tons sold in millions average sales price per low vol met ton sold average operating costs per low vol met ton sold average provision costs per low vol met ton sold average selling  administrative and other costs per low vol met ton sold average depreciation  depletion and amortization costs per low vol met ton sold total average costs per low vol met ton sold margin per low vol met ton sold average sales price for low volatile metallurgical coal has increased per ton  from the prior year  to for the year ended december  the increase of was mainly due to the strengthening of the global market for steel and steel related products when compared to total costs per ton sold of low volatile metallurgical coal were per ton for the year ended december  compared to per ton for the year ended december  the per ton improvement was related to operating the buchanan mine for all of versus seven months of the additional tonnage sold in has reduced the average per unit costs 
other coal segment the other coal segment had a loss before income tax of million for the year ended december  compared to a loss before income tax of million for the year ended december  the other coal segment includes purchased coal activities  idled mine activities as well as various other activities assigned to the coal segment but not allocated to each individual mine 
other coal segment produced coal sales revenue was million for the year ended december  this revenue includes the sale of incidental tonnage recovered during the reclamation process at idled facilities 
the primary focus of activity at these locations is reclaiming disturbed land in accordance with permit requirements after final mining has occurred 
the tons sold from these activities are incidental to total company production and sales 
purchased coal sales were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  purchased coal sales consist of revenues from processing third party coal in our preparation plants for blending purposes to meet customer coal specifications  coal purchased from third parties and sold directly to our customers and revenues from processing third party coal in our preparation plants for a fee 
freight revenue is the amount billed to customers for transportation costs incurred 
this revenue is based on weight of coal shipped  negotiated freight rates and method of transportation ie rail  barge  truck  etc 
used by the customers to which consol energy contractually provides transportation services 
freight revenue is offset in freight expense 
freight revenue was million in the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease of million was primarily due to lower tons being shipped on consol energy freight contracts in the period to period comparison 
miscellaneous other income was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the million decrease was due to the following items in the year ended december   million of income was recognized related to contracts with certain customers that were unable to take delivery of previously contracted coal tonnage 
these customers agreed to buy out their contracts in order to be released from the requirements of taking delivery of previously committed tons 
no such transactions were entered into in the year ended december  gain on sales of assets attributable to the other coal segment were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the change was related to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods  none of which were individually material 
coal royalty income from third parties was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was related to lower tons mined by third parties from our coal reserves in the period to period comparison 
in the year ended december   mark to market adjustments for free standing coal sales options resulted in approximately a million reversal of previously recognized unrealized losses 
the reversal of the losses was primarily due to the decrease in market price of coal in compared to no such transactions existed in the year ended december  other income increased million due to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods  none of which were individually material 
other coal segment total costs were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million was due to the following items closed and idle mine costs were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million in closed and idle mine costs was primarily related to additional reclamation liabilities recognized at the fola mining operation in west virginia 
as a result of market conditions  permitting issues  new regulatory requirements and resulting changes in mine plans  the reclamation liability associated with the fola operation increased approximately million 
additional closed and idle mine costs in were also related to a million charge as a result of a change in the mine plan at mine as a result of the mine plan change  a portion of the previously developed area of the mine has been abandoned 
these increases were offset  in part  by approximately million for changes in the operational status of various other mines  between idled and operating  throughout both periods which resulted in lower idled mine costs in shoemaker mine was idled throughout while the track haulage system was converted to a belt haulage system 
this mine was in production throughout litigation expense of million was recognized for the year ended december  related to a settlement that was reached in june the litigation was related to water discharge from our buchanan mine being stored in mine voids of adjacent properties which were leased by consol energy subsidiaries 
cost of goods sold and other charges have increased approximately million related to excess purchase price over appraised values for various land purchases that have been made throughout the year 
accounting guidance requires assets purchased to be recognized at the appraised value  synergies and related specific value to consol energy cannot be reflected as an asset 
various land deals in strategic areas for items such as refuse ponds  overland belts and various other key projects often require premiums over fair value  thus resulting in additional expense to consol energy at the time of the transaction 
litigation settlement expense of million was recognized for the year ended december  related to the sale of the jones fork mining complex 
cost of goods sold and other charges have increased approximately million due to various asset abandonments throughout the period  none of which were individually material 
these abandonments primarily related to engineering work  permitting work and mapping work for miscellaneous projects that are no longer being pursued by the company 
purchased coal consists of costs from processing purchased coal in our preparation plants for blending purposes to meet customer coal specifications  coal purchased and sold directly to the customer and costs for processing third party coal in our preparation plants 
these costs were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease of million was primarily due to reduced purchased coal volumes in the period to period comparison 
litigation expense of million was recognized for the year ended december  related to amounts accrued for the settlement of the levisa action and the pobst combs action 
this litigation related to depositing water in mine voids which a subsidiary of consol energy leased 
freight expense is based on weight of coal shipped  negotiated freight rates and method of transportation ie rail  barge  truck  etc 
used by the customers to which consol energy contractually provides transportation services 
freight expense is offset in freight revenue 
freight expense was million in the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease of million was primarily due to fewer tons shipped on consol energy freight contracts in the period to period comparison 
other costs have increased million primarily due to various contingent liabilities related to potential legal settlements as well as various other transactions that have occurred throughout both periods  none of which are individually material 
total gas segment analysis for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the gas segment contributed million to earnings before income tax for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  variances by the individual gas segments are discussed below

the decrease in cbm average sales price was the result of various gas swap transactions at a lower average price as compared to the prior year 
these gas swap transactions qualify as financial cash flow hedges that exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions 
these financial hedges represented approximately billion cubic feet of our produced cbm gas sales volumes for the year ended december  at an average price of per thousand cubic feet 
these financial hedges represented approximately billion cubic feet of our produced cbm gas sales volumes for the year ended december  at an average price of per thousand cubic feet 
average gas sales prices excluding the impact of hedging were per thousand cubic feet in compared to per thousand cubic feet in cbm sales volumes increased billion cubic feet primarily due to additional wells coming online from our on going drilling program 
we had  net cbm wells at december  compared to  net cbm wells at december  also  cbm volumes were lower by approximately billion cubic feet of deferrals related to the idling of the buchanan mine for approximately five months during total costs for the cbm gas segment were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase in total costs in the period to period comparison reflects the increase in average unit costs and the increase in sales volumes 
cbm lifting costs were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  average cbm lifting costs per unit were per thousand cubic feet for compared to per thousand cubic feet for the improvement in average cbm lifting costs per unit was due to lower salt water disposal costs attributable to recycling the water produced from our wells to be used in hydraulic fracturing of new wells 
previously  fees were incurred to dispose of the salt water produced from our wells 
unit costs were also improved due to higher volumes of cbm gas sold in the period to period comparison resulting in fixed costs being spread over additional volumes  lowering the average per unit costs 
these improvements were offset  in part  by higher severance taxes 
higher severance taxes were the result of average market price increases  excluding the impact of our hedging program 
severance taxes were also higher as a result of the buchanan county  virginia severance tax settlement which changed the deductions allowed in the calculation of severance tax due when the price of gas falls between certain ranges 
cbm gathering costs were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  average cbm gathering cost were per thousand cubic feet sold for the year ended december  compared to per thousand cubic feet sold for the year ended december  higher average unit costs were related to higher power costs attributable to utility rate increases in the period to period comparison as well as increased usage 
higher average unit costs were also attributable to additional in transit costs related to additional capacity of firm transportation being purchased after to assure delivery of additional volumes being produced 
these cost increases were offset  in part  by the increase in volumes sold 
general and direct administrative costs attributable to the total gas segment have increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was attributable to additional staffing and additional corporate service charges from consol energy 
with the dominion acquisition  which closed on april   the majority of the operational support personnel were retained 
total company general administrative costs have also increased  as explained previously  which resulted in additional charges being allocated to all segments 
general and direct administrative costs attributable to the cbm gas segment were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  general and direct administrative expenses attributable to the total gas segment are allocated to each individual gas segment based on a combination of production and employee counts 
although total gas general and direct administrative costs have increased million  as discussed above  the percentage allocated to the cbm segment is lower  on a unit basis  as the result of cbm production volumes to total gas volumes produced being lower primarily due to the dominion acquisition  which closed on april  depreciation  depletion and amortization attributable to the cbm segment was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  there was approximately million  or per unit of production  of depreciation  depletion and amortization related to cbm gas and related well equipment that was reflected on a units of production method of depreciation in the year ended december  the unit of production portion of depreciation  depletion and amortization was million  or per unit of production in the year ended december  the cbm unit of production rate used to calculate depreciation in the current year is generally calculated using the net book value of assets divided by either proved or proved developed reserves at the previous year end 
the in field drilling program and certain assets acquired in the dominion acquisition caused the rate to increase 
there was approximately million  or per thousand cubic feet of depreciation  depletion and amortization related to gathering and other equipment that is reflected on a straight line basis for the year ended december  the straight line component was million  or per thousand cubic feet for the year ended december  the increase was related to additional gathering assets placed in service after  offset  in part  by the increase in volumes in the period to period comparison 
shallow oil and gas segment the shallow oil and gas segment had a loss before income tax of million for the year ended december  compared to a loss before income tax of million for the year ended december  the shallow oil and gas segment revenue and cost components on a per unit basis are as follows for the years ended december  variance percent change produced gas shallow oil and gas sales volumes in billion cubic feet average shallow oil and gas sales price per thousand cubic feet sold average shallow oil and gas lifting costs per thousand cubic feet sold average shallow oil and gas gathering costs per thousand cubic feet sold average shallow oil and gas general direct administrative costs per thousand cubic feet sold average shallow oil and gas depreciation  depletion and amortization costs per thousand cubic feet sold total average shallow oil and gas costs per thousand cubic feet sold average margin for shallow oil and gas shallow oil and gas segment sales revenues were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  shallow oil and gas sales volumes increased billion cubic feet for the year ended december  primarily due to the dominion acquisition  which closed on april  approximately of the acquired producing wells were shallow oil and gas type wells 
there were  net shallow oil and gas wells at december compared to net shallow oil and gas wells at december  no shallow oil and gas gas volumes were hedged in or total costs for the shallow oil and gas segment were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million is attributable to additional volumes sold in the period to period comparison  offset  in part  by lower average unit costs sold 
shallow oil and gas average unit costs have decreased due to the significant increase in volumes related to production from wells acquired in the dominion acquisition  which closed on april  a detailed analysis of cost categories is not meaningful due to the significant change in this segment related to the dominion acquisition and will therefore not be presented 
general and direct administrative costs attributable to the total gas segment are allocated to each individual gas segment based on a combination of production and employee counts 
shallow oil and gas volumes are higher as a percent of total gas produced volumes in the period to period comparison and therefore  additional general and direct administrative costs have been allocated to the shallow oil and gas gas segment in marcellus segment the marcellus segment contributed million to the total company earnings before income tax for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the marcellus segment revenue and cost components on a per unit basis are as follows for the years ended december  variance percent change produced gas marcellus sales volumes in billion cubic feet average marcellus sales price per thousand cubic feet sold average marcellus lifting costs per thousand cubic feet sold average marcellus gathering costs per thousand cubic feet sold average marcellus general direct administrative costs per thousand cubic feet sold average marcellus depreciation  depletion and amortization costs per thousand cubic feet sold total average marcellus costs per thousand cubic feet sold average margin for marcellus the increase in marcellus average sales price was the result of an improvement in general market prices and various gas swap transactions that occurred in the year ended december  these gas swap transactions qualify as financial cash flow hedges that exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions 
these financial hedges represented approximately billion cubic feet of our produced marcellus gas sales volumes for the year ended december  at an average price of per thousand cubic feet 
there were no gas swap transactions for the marcellus segment that occurred for the year ended december  the increase in sales volumes was primarily due to additional wells coming on line from our on going drilling program 
at december  there were marcellus shale wells in production including wells acquired in the dominion acquisition  which closed on april  at december  there were marcellus shale wells in production 
total costs for the marcellus segment were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the additional sales volumes and higher average unit costs 
marcellus lifting costs were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  average marcellus lifting costs were per thousand cubic feet in compared to per thousand cubic feet in the increase in average lifting costs per unit sold was due to increased road repairs and other maintenance expense primarily related to the additional number of wells drilled in the current period 
salt water disposal fees were also higher in the period to period comparison due to the higher volume of water produced from additional wells 
these increases in costs were offset  in part  by the additional volume of marcellus gas sold in the period to period comparison 
marcellus gathering costs were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  average gathering cost per unit sold was per thousand cubic feet for the year ended december  compared to per thousand cubic feet for the year ended december  lower average gathering cost per unit was primarily attributable to the increase in volumes sold 
this improvement was offset  in part  by higher power and security costs 
higher power costs were related to higher rates being charged by utility companies in the period to period comparison 
higher security costs were related to additional security needs at various marcellus gathering stations 
general and direct administrative costs attributable to the marcellus gas segment were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  average general and direct administrative costs on a per unit sold basis were per thousand cubic feet for the year ended december  compared to per thousand cubic feet for the year ended december  general and direct administrative costs attributable to the total gas segment are allocated to each individual gas segment based on a combination of production and employee counts 
the total general and direct administrative cost increases  as discussed previously  were offset  in part  by higher volumes of gas produced from marcellus wells 
depreciation  depletion and amortization attributable to the marcellus segment was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  there was approximately million  or per unit of production  of depreciation  depletion and amortization related to marcellus gas and related well equipment that was reflected on a units of production method of depreciation in the year ended december  the unit of production portion of depreciation  depletion and amortization was million  or per unit of production in the year ended december  the marcellus unit of production rate used to calculate depreciation in the current year is generally calculated using the net book value of assets divided by either proved or proved developed reserves at the previous year end 
the investment in drilling activities increased in higher proportion than the related gas reserves in the current period  which resulted in a higher per unit rate 
there was approximately million  or per thousand cubic feet of depreciation  depletion and amortization related to gathering and other equipment that is reflected on a straight line basis for the year ended december  the straight line component was million  or per thousand cubic feet for the year ended december  the increase was related to additional gathering assets placed in service after  offset  in part  by the increase in volumes in the period to period comparison 
other gas segment the other gas segment includes activity not assigned to cbm  conventional or marcellus gas segments 
this segment includes purchased gas activity  gas royalty interest activity  exploration and other costs  other corporate expenses  and miscellaneous operational activity not assigned to a specific gas segment 
the other gas segment had a loss before income tax of million for the year ended december  compared to a loss before income tax of million for the year ended december  other gas sales volumes are primarily related to production from the chattanooga shale in tennessee 
revenue from this operation was approximately million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  there was billion cubic feet sold from this area for the year ended december  compared to billion cubic feet for the year ended december  total costs related to these other sales were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in costs in the period to period comparison was primarily due to higher depreciation  depletion and amortization attributable to the additional billion cubic feet of gas produced and higher unit of production rates 
the higher units of production rates were related to a higher proportion of capital assets placed in service versus the proportion of proved developed reserve additions 
a per unit analysis of the other operating costs in chattanooga is not meaningful due to the low volumes produced in the period to period analysis 
royalty interest gas sales represent the revenues related to the portion of production belonging to royalty interest owners sold by the consol energy gas segment 
the changes in market prices  contractual differences among leases  and the mix of average and index prices used in calculating royalties contributed to the period to period change 
royalty interest gas sales revenues were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  for the years ended december  variance percent change gas royalty interest sales volumes in billion cubic feet average sales price per thousand cubic feet purchased gas sales volumes represent volumes of gas we sold at market prices that were purchased from third party producers 
purchased gas sales revenues were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  for the years ended december  variance percent change purchased gas sales volumes in billion cubic feet average sales price per thousand cubic feet other income was consistent at million for the years ended december  and royalty interest gas costs represent the costs related to the portion of production belonging to royalty interest owners sold by the consol energy gas segment 
the changes in market prices  contractual differences among leases  and the mix of average and index prices used in calculating royalties contributed to the period to period change 
royalty interest gas sales costs were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  for the years ended december  variance percent change gas royalty interest sales volumes in billion cubic feet average cost per thousand cubic feet sold purchased gas volumes represent volumes of gas purchased from third party producers that we sell 
purchased gas volumes also reflect the impact of pipeline imbalances 
the higher average cost per thousand cubic feet is due to overall price changes  contractual differences among customers and the pipeline imbalance 
purchased gas costs were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  for the years ended december  variance percent change purchased gas volumes in billion cubic feet average cost per thousand cubic feet sold exploration and other costs were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase was made up of the following items for the years ended december  variance percent change dry hole and lease expiration costs exploration total exploration and other costs dry hole and lease expiration costs were million higher in the period to period comparison primarily due to lease surrenders in the current year  offset  in part  by lower dry wells drilled in the year ended december  exploration costs increased million in the period to period comparison due to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods  none of which were individually material 
other corporate expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase was due to the following items for the years ended december  variance percent change short term incentive compensation stock based compensation variable interest earnings bank fees financing and acquisition fees contract settlement other total other corporate expenses the short term incentive compensation program is designed to increase compensation to eligible employees when the gas segment reaches predetermined targets for safety  production and unit cost goals 
short term incentive compensation expense is higher in due to a increase in employee counts  as well as an increase in the short term incentive compensation allocation to the gas segment 
additional employees in the total company general and administrative area were primarily related to support staff retained in the dominion acquisition  which closed on april  and additional hiring to support operations 
stock based compensation is higher in the period to period comparison primarily due to the conversion of the cnx gas performance share units to consol energy restricted stock units in the year ended december  the conversion resulted in a reduction of approximately million of expense in additional expense was also related to stock based compensation allocated from consol energy to the gas segment in these increases were offset  in part  by the non vested cnx gas stock options being terminated in relation to the cnx gas take in transaction 
the expense previously recognized for these options was reversed on the gas segment 
all stock based compensation is now allocated from consol energy 
variable interest earnings are related to various adjustments a third party entity has reflected in its financial statements 
consol energy holds no ownership interest  but guarantees bank loans the entity holds related to its purchases of drilling rigs 
consol energy is also the main customer of the third party  and based on analysis is the primary beneficiary 
therefore  the entity is fully consolidated and then the impact is fully reversed in the noncontrolling interest line discussed below 
banks fees are higher in the period to period comparison due to amending and extending the revolving credit facility related to the gas segment 
financing and acquisition fees are related to legal expenses for the special committee  formed during the cnx gas take in transaction  and are primarily related to the shareholder litigation 
the year ended december  includes million of expense related to a contract buyout with a driller in order to mitigate idle rig charges in certain areas where drilling was not expected to increase in the near term 
other corporate expense increased million in the year to year comparison primarily due to unused firm transportation charges not being allocated to the operating gas segments and various other transactions that occurred throughout both periods  none of which were individually material 
interest expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  interest is incurred by the gas segment on the gas segment revolving credit facility  a capital lease and debt held by a variable interest entity 
no significant changes in these components occurred in the period to period comparison 
noncontrolling interest represents of the earnings impact of a third party which has been determined to be a variable interest entity  in which the consol energy gas segment holds no ownership interest  but is the primary beneficiary 
the consol energy gas segment has been determined to be the primary beneficiary due to guarantees of the third party s bank debt related to their purchase of drilling rigs 
the third party entity provides drilling services primarily to the consol energy gas segment 
consol energy consolidates the entity and then reflects of the impact as noncontrolling interest 
the consolidation does not significantly impact any amounts reflected in the gas segment income statement 
the variance in the noncontrolling interest amounts reflects the third party s variance in earnings in the period to period comparison 
other segment analysis for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the other segment includes activity from sales of industrial supplies  transportation operations and various other corporate activities that are not allocated to the coal or gas segment 
the other segment had a loss before income tax of million for the year ended december  compared to a loss of million for the year ended december  the other segment also includes total company income tax expense of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  for the years ended december  variance percent change sales outside other income total revenue cost of goods sold and other charges depreciation  depletion amortization taxes other than income tax interest expense total costs loss before income tax income tax net loss industrial supplies total revenues from industrial supply operations were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  total costs related to industrial supply sales were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase in expense is primarily due to changes in last in first out valuations 
transportation operations total revenue from transportation operations was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase was primarily attributable to additional through put tons at the baltimore terminal in the period to period comparison 
total costs related to transportation operations were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase was primarily related to the additional through put tons at the baltimore terminal in the period to period comparison 
miscellaneous other other income was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the million decrease was attributable to million of other income for the acceleration of a deferred gain associated with the initial sale leaseback of the company s previous headquarters in this was offset by million related to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods  none of which were individually material 
other corporate costs include interest cost  acquisition and financing costs and various other miscellaneous corporate charges 
total other costs were million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  other corporate costs increased million due to the following interest expense of million was incurred in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  the increase of million was primarily attributable to the additional interest expense on the long term bonds that were issued in conjunction with the dominion acquisition  which closed on april  financing and acquisition fees of million were incurred in the year ended december  primarily related to the equity and debt issuance that raised approximately billion dollars 
these fees also include costs related to extending and refinancing the consol energy revolving credit facility  the dominion acquisition and the purchase of the cnx gas noncontrolling interest 
bank fees of million were incurred in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  the increase of million was primarily related to the refinanced revolving credit facility 
fees related to the disposition of non core assets of million were incurred in the year ended december  various other corporate expenses were million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  the increase of million was due to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods  none of which were individually material 
in the year ended december   there was million of reduced expense related to an adjustment to assumptions used in the cease use of the company s previous headquarter liability 
the year ended december  included million of expense related to the cease use of the facility 
these transactions resulted in a million improvement in the period to period comparison 
severance payments of million were incurred in the year ended december  related to various layoffs that were necessary due to the economic downturn that occurred 
income taxes the effective income tax rate was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the effective tax rate is sensitive to the relationship between pre tax earnings and percentage depletion 
the proportion of coal pre tax earnings and gas pre tax earnings also impacts the benefit of percentage depletion on the effective tax rate 
the mix of pre tax income by state may also impact the overall effective tax rate 
the pre tax income mix by state has changed in the period to period comparison due to the dominion acquisition 
see note income taxes in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for additional explanation of the effective tax rate change in the period to period comparison 
for the years ended december  variance percent change total company earnings before income tax income tax expense effective income tax rate critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and at the date of the financial statements 
see note significant accounting policies in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for further discussion 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates upon subsequent resolution of identified matters 
management believes that the estimates utilized are reasonable 
the following critical accounting policies are materially impacted by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
business combinations at acquisition  consol energy allocates the cost of a business acquisition to the specific tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their relative fair values 
significant judgments and estimates are often made to determine these allocated values  and may include the use of appraisals  consideration of market quotes for similar transactions  employment of discounted cash flow techniques or consideration of other information consol energy believes relevant 
the finalization of the purchase price allocation will typically take a number of months to complete  and if final values are materially different from initially recorded amounts  adjustments are recorded 
any excess of the cost of a business acquisition over the fair values of the net assets and liabilities acquired is recorded as goodwill which is not amortized to expense 
recorded goodwill of a reporting unit is required to be tested for impairment on an annual basis  and between annual testing dates if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its net book value 
subsequent to the finalization of the purchase price allocation  any adjustments to the recorded values of acquired assets and liabilities would be reflected in the consolidated statement of operations 
once final  it is not permitted to revise the allocation of the original purchase price  even if subsequent events or circumstances prove the original judgments and estimates to be incorrect 
in addition  long lived assets like property and equipment  amortizable intangibles and goodwill may be deemed to be impaired in the future resulting in the recognition of an impairment loss 
the assumptions and judgments made when recording business combinations will have an impact on reported results of operations for many years into the future 
other post employment benefits opeb certain subsidiaries of consol energy provide medical and life insurance benefits to retired employees not covered by the coal industry retiree health benefit act of the medical plans contain certain cost sharing and containment features  such as deductibles  coinsurance  health care networks and coordination with medicare 
for salaried employees hired before january   the eligibility requirement is either age with years of service or age with years of service 
also  salaried employees and retirees contribute a target of of the medical plan operating costs 
contributions may be higher  dependent on either years of service or a combination of age and years of service at retirement 
prospective annual cost increases of up to will be shared by consol energy and the participants based on their age and years of service at retirement 
annual cost increases in excess of will be the responsibility of the participants 
any salaried or non represented hourly employees that were hired or rehired effective january  or later will not become eligible for retiree health benefits 
in lieu of traditional retiree health coverage  if certain eligibility requirements are met  these employees will receive a retiree medical spending allowance of  per year for each year of service at retirement 
newly employed inexperienced miners represented by the united mine workers of america umwa  hired after january   will not be eligible to receive retiree health benefits 
in lieu of these benefits  these employees will receive a defined contribution benefit of per each hour worked through december   increasing to per hour worked effective january  through december  after our review  various actuarial assumptions  including discount rate  expected trend in health care costs  average remaining service period  average remaining life expectancy  per capita costs and participation level in each future year are used by our independent actuary to estimate the cost and benefit obligations for our retiree health plans 
expected trends in future health care cost assumptions were adjusted from prior year to reflect recent experience and future expectations 
the initial expected trend in health care costs at this year s measurement date of with an ultimate trend rate of reached in the initial expected trend rate at last year s measurement date was with an ultimate trend rate of reached in a decrease in the health care trend rate would decrease interest and service cost for by approximately million 
a increase in the health care trend rate would increase the interest and service cost by approximately million 
the discount rate is determined each year at the measurement date 
the discount rate is determined by utilizing a corporate yield curve model developed from corporate bond data using only bonds rated aa by moody s as of the measurement date 
all future post employment benefit expected payments were discounted using a spot rate yield curve as of december  the appropriate discount rate was then selected from resulting discounted cash flows 
for the years ended december  and  the discount rate used to calculate the period end liability and the following year s expense was and  respectively 
a increase in the discount rate would have decreased net periodic postretirement benefit costs by approximately million 
a decrease in the discount rate would have increased net periodic postretirement benefit costs by approximately million 
deferred gains and losses are primarily due to historical changes in the discount rate and medical cost inflation differing from expectations in prior years 
changes to interest rates for the rates of returns on instruments that could be used to settle the actuarially determined plan obligations introduce substantial volatility to our costs 
accumulated actuarial gains or losses in excess of a pre established corridor are amortized on a straight line basis over the expected future service of active salary and non represented employees to their assumed retirement age 
at december  the average remaining service period is approximately years for our non represented plans 
accumulated actuarial gains or losses in excess of a pre established corridor are amortized on a straight line basis over the expected remaining life of our retired umwa population 
the average remaining service period of this population is not used for amortization purposes because the majority of the umwa population of our plan is retired 
at december   the average remaining life expectancy of our retired umwa population used to calculate the following year s expense is approximately years 
the weighted average per capita costs used to value the december  other postretirement benefit liability was approximately less than previously expected based on our trend assumption 
if the actual change in per capita cost of medical services or other postretirement benefits are significantly greater or less than the projected trend rates  the per capita cost assumption would need to be adjusted  which could have a significant effect on the costs and liabilities recorded in the financial statements 
significant increases in health and prescription drug costs for represented hourly retirees could have a material adverse effect on consol energy s operating cash flow 
however  the effect on consol energy s cash flow from operations for salaried employees is limited to approximately of the previous year s medical cost for salaried employees due to the cost sharing provision in the benefit plan 
the estimated liability recognized in the december  financial statements was billion 
for the year ended december   we paid approximately million for other postretirement benefits  all of which were paid from operating cash flow 
our obligations with respect to these liabilities are unfunded at december  consol energy does not expect to contribute to the other postretirement plan in we intend to pay benefit claims as they are due 
salaried pensions consol energy has non contributory defined benefit retirement plans covering substantially all employees not covered by multi employer plans 
the benefits for these plans are based primarily on years of service and employee s pay near retirement 
consol energy s salaried plan allows for lump sum distributions of benefits earned up until december   at the employees election 
the restoration plan was frozen effective december  and was replaced prospectively with the consol energy supplemental retirement plan 
consol energy s restoration plan allows only for lump sum distributions earned up until december  effective september   the supplemental retirement plan was amended to include employees of cnx gas 
the supplemental retirement plan was frozen effective december  for certain employees and was replaced prospectively with the consol energy defined contribution restoration plan 
in march of  the cnx gas defined benefit retirement plan was merged into the consol energy s non contributory defined benefit retirement plan 
at the time  the change did not impact the benefits for employees of cnx gas 
however  during an amendment was adopted to recognize past service at cnx gas to current employees of cnx gas who opted out of the plan for additional company contributions into their defined contribution plan and extend coverage to employees previously not eligible to participate in this plan 
our independent actuaries calculate the actuarial present value of the estimated retirement obligation based on assumptions including rates of compensation  mortality rates  retirement age and interest rates 
for the year ended december   compensation increases are assumed to range from to depending on age and job classification 
the discount rate is determined each year at the measurement date 
the discount rate is determined by utilizing a corporate yield curve model developed from corporate bond data using only bonds rated aa by moody s as of the measurement date 
all expected benefit payments from the consol energy retirement plan were discounted using a spot rate yield curve as of december  the appropriate equivalent discount rate was then selected for the resulting discounted pension cash flows 
for the years ended december  and  the discount rate used to calculate the period end liability and the following year s expense was and  respectively 
a increase in the discount rate would have decreased the net periodic pension cost by million 
a decrease in the discount rate would have increased the net periodic pension cost by million 
deferred gains and losses are primarily due to historical changes in the discount rate and earnings on assets differing from expectations 
at december  the average remaining service period is approximately years 
changes to any of these assumptions introduce substantial volatility to our costs 
the market related asset value is derived by taking the cost value of assets as of december  and multiplying it by the average month ratio of the market value of assets to the cost value of assets 
consol energy s pension plan weighted average asset allocations at december  consisted of equity securities and debt securities 
the estimated liability recognized in the december  financial statements was million 
for the year ended december   we contributed approximately million to defined benefit retirement plans other than multi employer plans trust and to other pension benefits 
our obligations with respect to these liabilities are partially funded at december  consol energy intends to contribute an amount that will avoid benefit restrictions for the following plan year 
workers compensation and coal workers pneumoconiosis workers compensation is a system by which individuals who sustain employment related physical injuries or some type of occupational diseases are compensated for their disabilities  medical costs  and on some occasions  for the costs of their rehabilitation 
workers compensation will also compensate the survivors of workers who suffer employment related deaths 
the workers compensation laws are administered by state agencies with each state having its own set of rules and regulations regarding compensation that is owed to an employee that is injured in the course of employment 
consol energy records an actuarially calculated liability  which is determined using various assumptions  including discount rate  future healthcare cost trends  benefit duration and recurrence of injuries 
the discount rate is determined each year at the measurement date 
the discount rate is determined by utilizing a corporate yield curve model developed from corporate bond data using only bonds rated aa by moody s as of the measurement date 
all future workers compensation expected benefit payments were discounted using a spot rate yield curve as of december  the appropriate equivalent discount rate was then selected from the resulting discounted workers compensation cash flows 
for the years ended december  and  the discount rate used to calculate the period end liability and the following year s expense was and  respectively 
a increase in the discount rate would have decreased the workers compensation expense cost by million 
a decrease in the discount rate would have increased the workers compensation expense by million 
deferred gains and losses are primarily due to historical changes in the discount rates  several years of favorable claims experience  various favorable state legislation changes and an overall lower incident rate than our assumptions 
accumulated actuarial gains or losses are amortized on a straight line basis over the expected future service of active employees that are eligible to file a future workers compensation claim 
at december   the average remaining service period is approximately years 
the estimated liability recognized in the financial statements at december  was approximately million 
consol energy s policy has been to provide for workers compensation benefits from operating cash flow 
for the year ended december   we made payments for workers compensation benefits and other related fees of approximately million  all of which was paid from operating cash flow 
our obligations with respect to these liabilities are unfunded at december  consol energy is responsible under the federal coal mine health and safety act of  as amended  for medical and disability benefits to employees and their dependents resulting from occurrences of coal workers pneumoconiosis disease 
consol energy is also responsible under various state statutes for pneumoconiosis benefits 
after our review  our independent actuaries calculate the actuarial present value of the estimated pneumoconiosis obligation based on assumptions regarding disability incidence  medical costs  mortality  death benefits  dependents and discount rates 
the discount rate is determined each year at the measurement date 
the discount rate is determined by utilizing a corporate yield curve model developed from corporate bond data using only bonds rated aa by moody s as of the measurement date 
all future coal workers pneumoconiosis expected benefit payments were discounted using a spot rate yield curve at december  the appropriate equivalent discount rate was then selected from the resulting discounted coal workers pneumoconiosis cash flows 
for the years ended december  and  the discount rate used to calculate the period end liability and the following year s expense was and  respectively 
a increase in the discount rate would have increased coal workers pneumoconiosis benefit by million 
a decrease in the discount rate would have decreased coal workers pneumoconiosis benefit by million 
actuarial gains associated with coal workers pneumoconiosis have resulted from numerous legislative changes over many years which have resulted in lower approval rates for filed claims than our assumptions originally reflected 
actuarial gains have also resulted from lower incident rates and lower severity of claims filed than our assumptions originally reflected 
the estimated liability recognized in the financial statements at december  was million 
for the year ended december   we paid coal workers pneumoconiosis benefits of approximately million  all of which was paid from operating cash flow 
our obligations with respect to these liabilities are unfunded at december  reclamation  mine closure and gas well closing obligations the surface mining control and reclamation act established operational  reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining as well as most aspects of deep mining 
consol energy accrues for the costs of current mine disturbance and final mine and gas well closure  including the cost of treating mine water discharge where necessary 
estimates of our total reclamation  mine closing liabilities  and gas well closing which are based upon permit requirements and consol energy engineering expertise related to these requirements  including the current portion  were approximately million at december  this liability is reviewed annually  or when events and circumstances indicate an adjustment is necessary  by consol energy management and engineers 
the estimated liability can significantly change if actual costs vary from assumptions or if governmental regulations change significantly 
accounting for asset retirement obligations requires that the fair value of an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the present value of the estimated asset retirement costs is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
asset retirement obligations primarily relate to the closure of mines and gas wells and the reclamation of land upon exhaustion of coal and gas reserves 
changes in the variables used to calculate the liabilities can have a significant effect on the mine closing  reclamation and gas well closing liabilities 
the amounts of assets and liabilities recorded are dependent upon a number of variables  including the estimated future retirement costs  estimated proven reserves  assumptions involving profit margins  inflation rates  and the assumed credit adjusted risk free interest rate 
accounting for asset retirement obligations also requires depreciation of the capitalized asset retirement cost and accretion of the asset retirement obligation over time 
the depreciation will generally be determined on a units of production basis  whereas the accretion to be recognized will escalate over the life of the producing assets  typically as production declines 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
all available evidence  both positive and negative  must be considered in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
at december   consol energy has deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities of approximately million 
the deferred tax assets are evaluated periodically to determine if a valuation allowance is necessary 
deferred tax valuation allowances decreased million in the year ended december  primarily due to the release of previously recognized valuation allowances related to certain pennsylvania net operating loss carry forwards and future temporary deductions 
valuation allowances on these net operating loss carry forwards and future temporary deductions were released during the year due to positive evidence outweighing negative evidence indicating that these benefits will be utilized in future years 
consol energy continues to report a deferred tax asset of approximately million relating to its state net operating loss carry forwards subject to a full valuation allowance 
a review of positive and negative evidence regarding these benefits  primarily the history of financial and tax losses on a separate company basis  concluded that a full valuation allowance was warranted 
the net operating loss carry forwards expire at various times from to a valuation allowance of million continues to be recognized against the state deferred tax asset attributable to future tax deductible differences for certain subsidiaries with histories of financial and tax losses 
management will continue to assess the realization of deferred tax assets attributable to state net operating loss carry forwards and future tax deductible differences based upon updated income forecast data and the feasibility of future tax planning strategies  and may record adjustments to valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets in future periods that could materially impact net income 
consol energy evaluates all tax positions taken on the state and federal tax filings to determine if the position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination 
for positions that meet the more likely than not to be sustained criteria  an evaluation to determine the largest amount of benefit  determined on a cumulative probability basis that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement is determined 
a previously recognized tax position is derecognized when it is subsequently determined that a tax position no longer meets the more likely than not threshold to be sustained 
the evaluation of the sustainability of a tax position and the probable amount that is more likely than not is based on judgment  historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates  that are not readily apparent from other sources  form the basis for recognizing an uncertain tax liability 
actual results could differ from those estimates upon subsequent resolution of identified matters 
estimates of our uncertain tax liabilities  including interest and the current portion  were approximately million at december  stock based compensation as of december   we have issued four types of share based payment awards options  restricted stock units  performance stock options and performance share units 
the black scholes option pricing model is used to determine fair value of stock options at the grant date 
various inputs are utilized in the black scholes pricing model  such as stock price on measurement date  exercise price defined in the award  expected dividend yield based on historical trend of dividend payouts  risk free interest rate based on a zero coupon treasury bond rate  expected term based on historical grant and exercise behavior  and expected volatility based on historic and implied stock price volatility of consol energy stock and public peer group stock 
these factors can significantly impact the value of stock options expense recognized over the requisite service period of option holders 
the fair value of each restricted stock unit awarded is equivalent to the closing market price of a share of our company s stock on the date of the grant 
the fair value of each performance share unit is determined by the underlying share price of our company stock on the date of the grant and management s estimate of the probability that the performance conditions required for vesting will be achieved 
as of december   million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested awards is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
see note stock based compensation in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements in item in this form k for more information 
contingencies consol energy is currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
we have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims 
this estimate has been developed in consultation with legal counsel involved in the defense of these matters and is based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
future results of operations for any particular quarter or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the outcome of these proceedings 
see note commitments and contingent liabilities in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements in item in this form k for further discussion 
successful efforts accounting we use the successful efforts method to account for our gas exploration and production activities 
under this method  cost of property acquisitions  successful exploratory wells  development wells and related support equipment and facilities are capitalized 
costs of unsuccessful exploratory or development wells are expensed when such wells are determined to be non productive  or if the determination cannot be made after finding sufficient quantities of reserves to continue evaluating the viability of the project 
we use this accounting policy instead of the full cost method because it provides a more timely accounting of the success or failure of our gas exploration and production activities 
derivative instruments consol energy enters into financial derivative instruments to manage exposure to natural gas and oil price volatility 
we measure every derivative instrument at fair value and record them on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability 
changes in fair value of derivatives are recorded currently in earnings unless special hedge accounting criteria are met 
for derivatives designated as fair value hedges  the changes in fair value of both the derivative instrument and the hedged item are recorded in earnings 
for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  the effective portions of changes in fair value of the derivative are reported in other comprehensive income or loss and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods which the forecasted transaction affects earnings 
the ineffective portions of hedges are recognized in earnings in the current year 
consol energy currently utilizes only cash flow hedges that are considered highly effective 
consol energy formally assesses  both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis  whether each derivative is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedge item 
if it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or if a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge  consol energy will discontinue hedge accounting prospectively 
coal and gas reserve values there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of economically recoverable coal and gas reserves  including many factors beyond our control 
as a result  estimates of economically recoverable coal and gas reserves are by their nature uncertain 
information about our reserves consists of estimates based on engineering  economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by our staff 
our coal reserves are periodically reviewed by an independent third party consultant 
our gas reserves have been reviewed by independent experts each year 
some of the factors and assumptions which impact economically recoverable reserve estimates include geological conditions  historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effects of regulations and taxes by governmental agencies  assumptions governing future prices  and future operating costs 
each of these factors may in fact vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating reserves 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of coal and gas attributable to a particular group of properties  and classifications of these reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows  may vary substantially 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates  and these variances may be material 
see risk factors in item a of this report for a discussion of the uncertainties in estimating our reserves

the senior secured leverage ratio was to at december  covenants in the facility limit our ability to dispose of assets  make investments  purchase or redeem consol energy common stock  pay dividends  merge with another company and amend  modify or restate  in any material way  the senior unsecured notes 
at december   the facility had no outstanding borrowings and million of letters of credit outstanding  leaving billion of unused capacity 
from time to time  consol energy is required to post financial assurances to satisfy contractual and other requirements generated in the normal course of business 
some of these assurances are posted to comply with federal  state or other government agencies statutes and regulations 
we sometimes use letters of credit to satisfy these requirements and these letters of credit reduce our borrowing facility capacity 
consol energy also has an accounts receivable securitization facility 
this facility allows the company to receive  on a revolving basis  up to million of short term funding and letters of credit 
the accounts receivable facility supports sales  on a continuous basis to financial institutions  of eligible trade accounts receivable 
consol energy has agreed to continue servicing the sold receivables for the financial institutions for a fee based upon market rates for similar services 
the cost of funds is based on commercial paper rates plus a charge for administrative services paid to financial institutions 
at december   eligible accounts receivable totaled approximately million and there were no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding against the facility

uncertainty in the financial markets brings additional potential risks to consol energy 
the risks include declines in our stock price  less availability and higher costs of additional credit  potential counterparty defaults  and commercial bank failures 
financial market disruptions may impact our collection of trade receivables 
as a result  consol energy constantly monitors the creditworthiness of our customers 
we believe that our current group of customers are financially sound and represent no abnormal business risk 
consol energy believes that cash generated from operations and our borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements  anticipated capital expenditures other than major acquisitions  scheduled debt payments  anticipated dividend payments and to provide required letters of credit 
nevertheless  the ability of consol energy to satisfy its working capital requirements  to service its debt obligations  to fund planned capital expenditures or to pay dividends will depend upon future operating performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the coal and gas industries and other financial and business factors  some of which are beyond consol energy s control 
in order to manage the market risk exposure of volatile natural gas prices in the future  consol energy enters into various physical gas supply transactions with both gas marketers and end users for terms varying in length 
consol energy has also entered into various gas swap transactions that qualify as financial cash flow hedges  which exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions 
the fair value of these contracts was a net asset of million at december  the ineffective portion of these contracts was insignificant to earnings in the year ended december  no issues related to our hedge agreements have been encountered to date 
consol energy frequently evaluates potential acquisitions 
consol energy has funded acquisitions with cash generated from operations and a variety of other sources  depending on the size of the transaction  including debt and equity financing 
there can be no assurance that additional capital resources  including debt and equity financing  will be available to consol energy on terms which consol energy finds acceptable  or at all 
cash flows in millions for the years ended december  change cash flows from operating activities cash used in investing activities cash used in provided by financing activities cash flows provided by operating activities changed in the period to period comparison primarily due to the following items operating cash flow increased million in due to higher net income attributable to consol energy shareholders in the period to period comparison 
the net income included an approximately million reduction due to the abandonment of mine which is discussed further in note property  plant and equipment  in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
this reduction did not have a corresponding reduction to cash flows from operating activities because it was primarily related to the write down of assets remaining at mine at the time of the abandonment  not cash obligations 
operating cash flows increased due to various other changes in operating assets  operating liabilities  other assets and other liabilities which occurred throughout both years  none of which were individually material

the declaration and payment of dividends by consol energy is subject to the discretion of consol energy s board of directors  and no assurance can be given that consol energy will pay dividends in the future 
consol energy s board of directors determines whether dividends will be paid quarterly 
the determination to pay dividends will depend upon  among other things  general business conditions  consol energy s financial results  contractual and legal restrictions regarding the payment of dividends by consol energy  planned investments by consol energy and such other factors as the board of directors deems relevant 
our credit facility limits our ability to pay dividends in excess of an annual rate of per share when our leverage ratio exceeds to or our availability is less than or equal to million 
the leverage ratio was to and our availability was approximately billion at december  the credit facility does not permit dividend payments in the event of default 
the indentures to the  and notes limit dividends to per share annually unless several conditions are met 
conditions include no defaults  ability to incur additional debt and other payment limitations under the indentures 
there were no defaults in the year ended december  off balance sheet transactions consol energy does not maintain off balance sheet transactions  arrangements  obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or others that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on consol energy s financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources which are not disclosed in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements 
consol energy participates in various multi employer benefit plans such as the united mine workers of america umwa pension plan  the umwa combined benefit fund and the umwa benefit plan which generally accepted accounting principles recognize on a pay as you go basis 
these benefit arrangements may result in additional liabilities that are not recognized on the balance sheet at december  the various multi employer benefit plans are discussed in note other employee benefit plans in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
consol energy also uses a combination of surety bonds  corporate guarantees and letters of credit to secure our financial obligations for employee related  environmental  performance and various other items which are not reflected on the balance sheet at december  management believes these items will expire without being funded 
see note commitments and contingencies in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for additional details of the various financial guarantees that have been issued by consol energy 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board issued an update to the comprehensive income topic of the accounting standards codification intended to improve the comparability  consistency  and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income 
this update allows entities to continue to report reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income consistent with the presentation requirements in effect before update all other requirements included within update are not affected and entities must report comprehensive income either in a single continuous financial statement or in two separate but consecutive financial statements 
the effective date of this update is for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  we believe adoption of this new guidance will not have a material impact on consol energy s financial statements as these updates have an impact on presentation only 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in addition to the risks inherent in operations  consol energy is exposed to financial  market  political and economic risks 
the following discussion provides additional detail regarding consol energy s exposure to the risks of changing commodity prices  interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
consol energy is exposed to market price risk in the normal course of selling natural gas production and to a lesser extent in the sale of coal 
consol energy sells coal under both short term and long term contracts with fixed price and or indexed price contracts that reflect market value 
consol energy uses fixed price contracts  collar price contracts and derivative commodity instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges under the derivatives and hedging topic of the financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification to minimize exposure to market price volatility in the sale of natural gas 
our risk management policy prohibits the use of derivatives for speculative purposes 
consol energy has established risk management policies and procedures to strengthen the internal control environment of the marketing of commodities produced from its asset base 
all of the derivative instruments without other risk assessment procedures are held for purposes other than trading 
they are used primarily to mitigate uncertainty  volatility and cover underlying exposures 
consol energy s market risk strategy incorporates fundamental risk management tools to assess market price risk and establish a framework in which management can maintain a portfolio of transactions within pre defined risk parameters 
consol energy believes that the use of derivative instruments  along with our risk assessment procedures and internal controls  mitigates our exposure to material risks 
however  the use of derivative instruments without other risk assessment procedures could materially affect consol energy s results of operations depending on market prices 
nevertheless  we believe that use of these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity 
for a summary of accounting policies related to derivative instruments  see note significant accounting policies in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
a sensitivity analysis has been performed to determine the incremental effect on future earnings  related to open derivative instruments at december  a hypothetical percent decrease in future natural gas prices would increase future earnings related to derivatives by million 
similarly  a hypothetical percent increase in future natural gas prices would decrease future earnings related to derivatives by million 
consol energy s interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in the united states 
at december   consol energy had  million aggregate principal amount of debt outstanding under fixed rate instruments and no debt outstanding under variable rate instruments 
consol energy s primary exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our revolving credit facility  under which there were no borrowings outstanding at december  consol energy s revolving credit facility bore interest at a weighted average rate of per annum during the year ended december  a basis point increase in the average rate for consol energy s revolving credit facility would not have significantly decreased net income for the period 
cnx gas  also had borrowings during the period under its revolving credit facility which bears interest at a variable rate 
cnx gas facility had no outstanding borrowings at december  and bore interest at a weighted average rate of per annum during the year ended december  due to the level of borrowings against this facility and the low weighted average interest rate in the year ended december   a basis point increase in the average rate for cnx gas revolving credit facility would not have significantly decreased net income for the period 
almost all of consol energy s transactions are denominated in us dollars  and  as a result  it does not have material exposure to currency exchange rate risks 
hedging volumes as of january  our hedged volumes for the periods indicated are as follows for the three months ended march  june  september  december  total year fixed price volumes hedged mcf weighted average hedge price mcf fixed price volumes hedged mcf weighted average hedge price mcf fixed price volumes hedged mcf weighted average hedge price mcf fixed price volumes hedged mcf weighted average hedge price mcf
