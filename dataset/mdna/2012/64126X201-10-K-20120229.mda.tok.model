critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to utilize accounting policies and make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during a fiscal period 
the securities and exchange commission  or sec  considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to a company s financial condition and results of 
table of contents operations  and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
we have discussed the selection and development of the critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed our related disclosures in this report 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates are appropriate and reasonable  actual results may differ from those estimates 
in addition  while we have used our best estimates based on the facts and circumstances available to us at the time  we reasonably could have used different estimates in the current period 
changes in the accounting estimates we use are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
if actual results or events differ materially from those contemplated by us in making these estimates  our reported financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected 
see the information in our filings with the sec from time to time and item a of this report  risk factors  for certain matters that may bear on our results of operations 
acquisitions we record acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting 
we recognize all of the assets acquired  liabilities assumed  contractual contingencies and contingent consideration  when applicable  at their fair value as of the acquisition date 
we record the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired as goodwill 
the application of the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in order to properly allocate purchase price consideration 
these assumptions and estimates reflect our expected use of the asset and the appropriate discount rates from a market participant perspective 
our estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies  and are determined with assistance from an independent third party appraisal firm 
our significant assumptions and estimates can include  but are not limited to  the cash flows that an acquired asset is expected to generate in the future  the weighted average cost of capital  long term projected revenues and growth rates  and the estimated royalty rate in the application of the relief from royalty valuation method 
these estimates are inherently uncertain 
in addition  unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates 
during the third quarter of  we acquired the assets and assumed certain liabilities of the numbering solutions business of evolving systems  inc and recorded million of goodwill and million of definite lived intangible assets 
during the fourth quarter of  we acquired the capital stock of targusinfo for approximately million 
in connection with this acquisition  we assumed unvested options with an estimated total fair value of million 
of the total million  approximately million will be expensed for post combination services and approximately million has been included in the purchase price 
the estimated fair value of the assumed unvested options was determined utilizing the hull white lattice model which required us to apply judgment and use subjective assumptions  including volatility of stock prices and an employee forfeiture rate based on our historical experience 
we recorded million of goodwill and million of definite lived intangible assets 
see note to our audited consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report 
revenue recognition as part of our carrier services  we provide wireline and wireless number portability  implement the allocation of pooled blocks of telephone numbers and provide network management services pursuant to seven contracts with napm 
in january  we amended our seven regional contracts with napm 
the aggregate fees for transactions processed under the amended contracts are determined by an annual fixed fee pricing model under which the annual fixed fee  or base fee  was set at million  million and million in  and  respectively  and is subject to an annual price escalator of in subsequent years 
these amended contracts also provide for a fixed credit of million in  million in and million in  which are applied to reduce the base fee for the applicable year 
additional credits of up to million annually in each of  and may be earned if the customers reach certain levels of aggregate telephone number inventories and adopt and implement certain ip fields and functionality 
in the event that the volume of transactions in a given year is above or below the contractually established volume range for that year  the base fee may be adjusted up or down  respectively  with any such adjustment being applied against invoices in the following year 
to the extent any available additional credits expire unused at the end of a year  they will be recognized in revenue at that time 
we determine the fixed and determinable fee under these amended contracts on an annual basis at the beginning of each year and recognize this fee in our carrier services operating segment on a straight line basis over twelve months 
for  we concluded that the fixed and determinable fee equaled million  which represented the base fee of million reduced by the million fixed credit and million of additional credits 
during  our customers adopted and implemented the requisite ip fields and functionality  and as a result earned million of credits for each of  and however  the customers did not reach the levels of aggregate telephone number inventories required to earn additional credits in and as a result  we recognized million of revenue in the fourth quarter of our total revenue recognized under our seven regional contracts with napm to provide npac services was million for the year ended december  
table of contents for  we concluded that the fixed and determinable fee equaled million  which represented the base fee of million  reduced by the million fixed credit and million of additional credits 
during  our carrier customers earned all of the available additional credits of million for the adoption and implementation of the requisite ip fields and functionality and the achievement of specific levels of aggregate telephone number inventories 
for  we concluded that the fixed and determinable fee equaled million  which represented the base fee of million  reduced by the million fixed credit and million of additional credits 
during  our carrier customers earned all of the available additional credits of million for the adoption and implementation of the requisite ip fields and functionality and the achievement of specific levels of aggregate telephone number inventories 
fees under our contracts with napm are billed to telecommunications service providers based on their allocable share of the total transaction charges 
this allocable share is based on each respective telecommunications service provider s share of the aggregate end user services revenues of all us telecommunications service providers  as determined by the fcc 
under our contracts with napm  we also bill a revenue recovery collections  or rrc  fee of a percentage of monthly billings to our customers  which is available to us if any telecommunications service provider fails to pay its allocable share of total transactions charges 
if the rrc fee is insufficient for that purpose  these contracts also provide for the recovery of such differences from the remaining telecommunications service providers 
for more information regarding our revenue recognition policy  please see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report 
service level standards some of our private commercial contracts require us to meet service level standards and impose corresponding penalties for failure to meet those standards 
we record a provision for these performance related penalties when we become aware that we have failed to meet required service levels  which results in a corresponding reduction of our revenue 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess purchase price paid over the fair value of tangible or identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our acquisitions 
in accordance with the intangibles goodwill and other topic of the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  accounting standards codification  or asc  we test our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate an impairment may have occurred 
our annual goodwill impairment analysis  which we performed for each of our two reporting units as of october   did not result in an impairment charge 
we determined the estimated fair value of our reporting units using the income approach and the market approach  consistent with the approach we utilized in our analysis performed in to assist in the process of determining fair value  we performed internal valuation analyses  considered other publicly available market information and obtained appraisals from external advisors 
significant assumptions used in the determination of fair value under the income approach included assumptions regarding market penetration  anticipated growth rates  and risk adjusted discount rates 
significant assumptions used in the determination of fair value under the market approach included the selection of comparable companies 
the key assumptions used in our annual goodwill impairment test to determine the fair value of our reporting units included a cash flow projections  which include growth and allocation assumptions for forecasted revenue and expenses  b a residual growth rate of to  c a discount rate of to  which was based upon each respective reporting unit s weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the risks associated with the operations at the time of the assessment  d selection of comparable companies used in the market approach  and e assumptions in weighting the results of the income approach and the market approach valuation techniques 
as of the date of our annual impairment test  our estimated fair values for each of our reporting units substantially exceeded each of our reporting units carrying value 
we believe that the assumptions and estimates used to determine the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units are reasonable  however  these estimates are inherently subjective  and there are a number of factors  including factors outside of our control that could cause actual results to differ from our estimates 
changes in estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
any changes to our key assumptions about our businesses and our prospects  or changes in market conditions  could cause the fair value of one of our reporting units to fall below its carrying value  resulting in a potential impairment charge 
in addition  changes in our organizational structure or how our management allocates resources and assesses performance could result in a change of our operating segments or reporting units  requiring a reallocation and impairment analysis of our goodwill 
a goodwill impairment 
table of contents charge could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements because of the significance of goodwill to our consolidated balance sheet 
as of december   we had million  million  and million in goodwill for our carrier services  enterprise services  and information services operating segments  respectively  the latter of which is attributable to our acquisition of targusinfo on november  and was not included in our annual impairment test 
accounts receivable  revenue recovery collections  and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest 
in accordance with our contracts with napm  we bill an rrc fee of a percentage of monthly billings to our customers 
the aggregate rrc fees collected may be used to offset uncollectible receivables from an individual customer 
beginning july   the rrc fee was of monthly billings 
on july   the rrc fee was reduced to and further reduced to on july  any accrued rrc fees in excess of uncollectible receivables are paid back to the customers annually on a pro rata basis 
all other receivables related to services not covered by the rrc fees are evaluated and  if deemed not collectible  are appropriately reserved 
investments as of december   we have approximately million of investments in pre refunded municipal bonds 
these investments are accounted for as available for sale securities and unrealized gains or losses on these investments are recorded in other comprehensive income 
we are exposed to investment risk as it relates to changes in the market value of our investments 
we determine the fair value of our investments using third party pricing sources  which primarily use a consensus price or weighted average price for the fair value assessment 
the consensus price is determined by using matrix prices from a variety of industry standard pricing services  data providers  large financial institutions and other third party sources and utilizing those matrix prices as inputs into a distribution curve based algorithm to determine the estimated market value 
matrix prices are based on quoted prices for securities with similar terms ie coupon rate  maturity  credit rating 
we corroborate consensus prices provided by third party pricing sources using reported trade activity  benchmark yield curves  binding broker dealer quotes or other relevant price information 
as of december   we determined that declines in the fair value of our investments are considered to be not other than temporary 
given the significance of these investments to our consolidated balance sheet  declines in the fair value that are considered to be other than temporary could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
these deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such amounts are expected to reverse or be utilized 
the realization of deferred tax assets is contingent upon the generation of future taxable income 
when appropriate  we recognize a valuation allowance to reduce such deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be ultimately realized 
the calculation of deferred tax assets  including valuation allowances  and liabilities requires us to apply significant judgment related to such factors as the application of complex tax laws  changes in tax laws and our future operations 
we review our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis to determine if a valuation allowance is required based upon these factors 
changes in our assessment of the need for a valuation allowance could give rise to a change in such allowance  potentially resulting in additional expense or benefit in the period of change 
our income tax provision includes us federal  state  local and foreign income taxes and is based on pre tax income or loss 
in determining the annual effective income tax rate  we analyzed various factors  including our annual earnings and taxing jurisdictions in which the earnings were generated  the impact of state and local income taxes and our ability to use tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards 
we assess uncertain tax positions and recognize income tax benefits when  based on the technical merits of a tax position  we believe that if a dispute arose with the taxing authority and was taken to a court of last resort  it is more likely than not ie  a probability of greater than percent that the tax position would be sustained as filed 
if a position is determined to be more likely than not of being sustained  the reporting enterprise should recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority 
our practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 
tax years through remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject 
the internal revenue service  or irs  has completed an examination of our federal income tax returns for the years and the audit resulted in no material adjustments 
we also settled a withholding tax audit with the israeli taxing authority for the years to the audit resulted in no material adjustments 

table of contents stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation expense in accordance with the compensation stock compensation topic of the fasb asc which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for stock based awards granted to employees based on estimated fair values on the date of grant 
the estimated fair values of non vested stock based awards granted to consultants are measured and recognized each reporting period through each vesting date 
we estimate the fair value of each option based award using the black scholes option pricing model 
this option pricing model requires that we make several estimates  including the option s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
because stock based compensation expense is based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest  the amount of expense takes into account estimated forfeitures at the time of grant  which estimate may be revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
changes in these estimates and assumptions can materially affect the estimated fair value of our stock based compensation 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report for information regarding our assumptions related to stock based compensation and the amount of stock based compensation expense we incurred for the periods covered in this report 
as of december   total unrecognized compensation expense was million  which relates to non vested stock options  non vested restricted stock units  non vested restricted stock awards and non vested performance vested restricted stock units  or pvrsus  and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
we estimate the fair value of our restricted stock unit awards based on the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
our outstanding restricted stock unit awards are subject to service based vesting conditions and or performance based vesting conditions 
we recognize the estimated fair value of service based awards  net of estimated forfeitures  as stock based compensation expense over the vesting period on a straight line basis 
awards with performance based vesting conditions require the achievement of specific financial targets at the end of the specified performance period and the employee s continued employment over the vesting period 
we recognize the estimated fair value of performance based awards  net of estimated forfeitures  as stock based compensation expense over the vesting period  which considers each performance period or tranche separately  based upon our determination of whether it is probable that the performance targets will be achieved 
at each reporting period  we reassess the probability of achieving the performance targets within the related performance period 
determining whether the performance targets will be achieved involves judgment  and the estimate of stock based compensation expense may be revised periodically based on changes in the probability of achieving the performance targets 
if any performance goals are not met  no compensation cost is ultimately recognized against that goal  and to the extent previously recognized  compensation cost is reversed 
as of december   the level of achievement of the performance target awards for pvrsus granted during  and was  and  respectively 
changes in our assumptions regarding the achievement of specific financial targets could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
during  we revised our estimate of achievement of the performance target related to the pvrsus granted during from of target to of target  and further revised our estimate of achievement in the fourth quarter of to of target 
in addition  we revised our estimate of achievement of the performance target related to the pvrsus granted during from of target to of target  and further revised our estimate of achievement in the fourth quarter of to of target 
these changes in estimates did not have a material impact on our income from continuing operations and our earnings per diluted share from continuing operations  respectively  for the year ended december

total cash  cash equivalents and investments were million at december   a decrease of million from million at december  this decrease in cash  cash equivalents and investments was primarily due to our repurchase of million of shares of our class a common stock  our acquisition of the numbering solutions assets for cash consideration of approximately million  and our acquisition of targusinfo for cash consideration of approximately million 
we funded our acquisition of targusinfo with a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under our new million senior secured term loan facility

the following is a summary of our commercial commitments secured by standby letters of credit by commitment date as of december  total less than year years years more than years in thousands standby letters of credit the amounts presented in the tables above may not necessarily reflect our actual future cash funding requirements because the actual timing of the future payments made may vary from the stated contractual obligation 
in addition  due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december   we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of market risks  including changes in interest rates affecting the return on our term facility  investments  and foreign currency fluctuations 
borrowings outstanding under our term facility bear interest  at our option  either i at the base rate  which is defined as the highest of a the federal funds rate plus  b the interest rate published by the wall street journal as the us prime rate and c the adjusted libor rate for a one month interest period beginning on such day plus  provided that the base rate for loans under the term facility is deemed to be not less than per annum or ii at the libor rate plus  in each case  an applicable margin 
the applicable margin is i in respect of the term facility  per annum for borrowings based on the base rate and per annum for borrowings based on the libor rate  and ii in respect of the revolving facility  per annum for borrowings based on the base rate and per annum borrowings based on the libor rate 
as of december   the libor rate on our term facility was below the applicable margin  or floor  and a hypothetical increase or decrease of in the libor rate would not impact our interest rate 
exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates affects the value of our investment portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments to hedge against such risk in our investment portfolio 
we invest in securities of highly rated issuers and follow investment policies limiting  among other things  the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we seek to limit default risk by purchasing only investment grade securities 
we do not actively manage the risk of interest rate fluctuations on our short term investments  however  our exposure to this risk is mitigated by the relatively short term nature of these investments 
based on a hypothetical adverse movement in interest rates  the impact on our interest income for our short term investments for the year ended december  would have been insignificant 
we have accounts on our foreign subsidiaries ledgers which are maintained in the respective subsidiary s local foreign currency and remeasured into the united states dollar 
as a result  we are exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the united states dollar and against the currencies of other countries in which we sell services 
as of december   our assets and liabilities related to non dollar denominated currencies were primarily related to intercompany payables and receivables 
an increase or decrease of in foreign exchange rate would not have a material impact on our financial position 
because our sales and expense are primarily denominated in local currency  the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on sales and expenses has not been material  and we do not employ measures intended to manage foreign exchange rate risk
