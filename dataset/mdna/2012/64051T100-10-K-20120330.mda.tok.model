item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis by our management of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  such as statements of our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
please also see the cautionary language at the beginning of part i of this annual report on form k regarding forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in risk factors of this annual report on form k 
in the fourth quarter of  we initiated a plan to sell a component of our business  shenzhen photon broadband technology co  ltd 
broadband  a subsidiary in china 
as such  the net assets of broadband are classified as held for sale in our consolidated balance sheets and the results of operations associated with broadband are presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented 
unless otherwise indicated  all discussions relate to the company s continuing operations 
business overview we are a leading designer and manufacturer of pic based modules and subsystems for bandwidth intensive  high speed communications networks 
our products are designed to enable high speed transmission rates and efficient allocation of bandwidth over optical networks with high quality and low costs 
our pic technology utilizes proprietary design elements that provide optical functionality on a silicon or indium phosphide chip 
pic devices can integrate many more functional elements than discretely packaged components  enabling increased functionality in a small form factor while reducing packaging and interconnection costs 
in addition  the cost advantages of pic based components are similar to the economics of semiconductor wafer mass manufacturing  where the marginal cost of producing an incremental chip is much less than that of a discrete component 
we have research and development and wafer fabrication facilities in san jose and fremont  california which coordinate with our research and development and manufacturing facilities in shenzhen and wuhan  china  and in tokyo  japan 
we utilize proprietary design tools and design for manufacturing techniques to align our design process with our precision nanoscale  vertically integrated manufacturing and testing capabilities 
we sell our products to the leading network equipment vendors globally  including adva ag optical networking ltd  alcatel lucent sa  ciena corporation  cisco systems  inc  eci telecom ltd  telefonaktiebolaget lm ericsson  fiberhome technologies group  fujitsu limited  huawei technologies co  ltd  juniper networks  inc  mitsubishi electric corporation  nec corporation  nokia siemens networks bv and zte corporation 
we refer to these companies as our tier customers 
we operate a sales model that focuses on direct alignment with our customers through coordination of our sales  product engineering and manufacturing teams 
our sales and marketing organizations support our strategy of increasing product penetration with our tier customers while also serving our broader customer base 
we use a direct sales force in the us  china  canada  israel  japan  russia and the european union 
these individuals work with our product engineers  and product marketing and sales operations teams  in an integrated approach to address our customers current and future needs 
we also engage independent commissioned representatives worldwide to extend our global reach 
in february  we completed our initial public offering of  shares of common stock  including the full underwriters over allotment option  at a public offering price of per share 
our initial public offering generated net proceeds of million before offering expenses 
in connection with the closing of the 
table of contents initial public offering  all of the shares of our series  series and series preferred stock then outstanding automatically converted into  shares of common stock on a for basis and all of the shares of our series x preferred stock then outstanding automatically converted into  shares of common stock on a for basis 
in addition  we have completed several acquisitions as follows in march  we acquired lightwave microsystems corporation  a developer and fabricator of photonic integrated circuits  in march  we completed the acquisition of photon technology co  ltd 
now named neophotonics china co  ltd  a manufacturer of active optoelectronics  transceivers and modules  in june  we acquired lightconnect  inc  which expanded our product portfolio by adding a line of micro electromechanical systems based optical components and modules  in june  we acquired optun  inc  a developer of roadm technology  in august  we completed an acquisition of beamexpress  inc  an integrator of active indium phosphide telecommunications devices in parallel optics high speed transceivers  in november  we acquired paxera corporation  a developer of tunable technology for dynamically reconfigurable networks  and in february  we acquired certain assets and intellectual property from mitsubishi electric corporation relating to the manufacture of high speed transceivers 
in october  we acquired santur  a designer and manufacturer of indium phosphide based pic products 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with usgaap 
these principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and cash flow  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
our estimates include those related to revenue recognition  stock based compensation expense  impairment analysis of goodwill and long lived assets  valuation of inventory  warranty liabilities and accounting for income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results  our future financial statements will be affected 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  which are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity 
accordingly  we believe these are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of our products provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
contracts and or customer purchase orders are used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
shipping documents and customer acceptance  when applicable  are used to verify delivery 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess collectability based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and the customer s payment history 

table of contents we recognize revenue when the product is shipped and title has transferred to the buyer 
we bear all costs and risks of loss or damage to the goods up to that point 
on most orders  our terms of sale provide that title passes to the buyer upon shipment by us 
in certain cases  our terms of sale may provide that title passes to the buyer upon delivery of the goods to the buyer 
we determine payments made to third party sales representatives are appropriately recorded to sales and marketing expense and not a reduction of revenue as the sales agent services they provide have an identifiable benefit and are made at similar rates of other sales agent service providers 
shipping and handling costs are included in the cost of goods sold 
we present revenue net of sales taxes and any similar assessments 
stock based compensation expense our stock based compensation expense was recorded as follows years ended december  in thousands cost of goods sold research and development sales and marketing general and administrative effective january   we adopted new authoritative accounting guidance for stock based compensation expense  which requires enterprises to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments  including stock options  based on the grant date fair value of the award 
we adopted the new guidance using the prospective transition method 
under this transition method  beginning january   employee stock based compensation expense includes compensation cost for all stock based awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of december   based on the intrinsic value method and compensation cost for all stock based awards granted or modified subsequent to december   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the new guidance 
we grant stock options  stock purchase rights  stock appreciation units and restricted stock units to employees and directors 
the stock based awards are accounted for at fair value as of the measurement date 
for stock options and restricted stock units  the measurement date is the grant date and for stock purchase rights the measurement date is the first day of the offering period 
stock appreciation units are subject to remeasurement each reporting period 
we measure restricted stock units based on the value of our common stock on the date of grant 
our determination of the fair value of all of our other stock based payment awards on the measurement date utilizes the black scholes option pricing model  and is impacted by our common stock price as well as changes in assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  expected common stock price volatility over the term of the option awards  projected employee option exercise behaviors expected period between stock option vesting date and stock option exercise date  risk free interest rates and expected dividends 
we recognize the fair value over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award  known as the requisite service period usually the vesting period on a straight line basis 
stock based compensation expense includes the impact of estimated forfeitures 
we estimate future forfeitures at the date of grant and revise the estimates  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the black scholes pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable  characteristics not present in our option grants 
existing 
table of contents valuation models  including the black scholes model  may not provide reliable measures of the fair value of ourstock based awards 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair value of our stock based awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon exercise 
stock options may expire or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our consolidated financial statements 
alternatively  value may be realized from these instruments that are significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our consolidated financial statements 
with regard to stock appreciation units  the value remeasured each period may not be representative of the value realized upon exercise 
for the years ended december   and  we calculated the fair value of stock options granted to employees using the black scholes pricing model with the following assumptions years ended december  stock options weighted average expected term years weighted average volatility risk free interest rate expected dividends stock appreciation units became exercisable upon the expiration of lock up agreement entered into with substantially all of our stockholders in connection with our public offering in february thus  stock based compensation expense in included a catch up expense for stock appreciation units previously granted to certain employees as well as the ongoing expense relating to the portion of these awards vesting after our initial public offering in february prior to our initial public offering  no expense was recognized for these awards given their contingent nature 
the expense was calculated using the black scholes option pricing model and included the value of our common stock  which could vary significantly 
for the year ended december   we calculated the fair value of stock appreciation units granted to employees using the black scholes pricing model with the following assumptions stock appreciation units weighted average expected term years weighted average volatility risk free interest rate expected dividends the first share purchase rights were granted february   the first day our common stock was listed on the new york stock exchange 
the offering period  which extended through november  contained two purchase dates  one in may and one in november the second offering period commenced november  and contains two purchase dates  one in may and one in november we account for the stock purchase rights at the grant date first day of the offering period by valuing the two purchase periods separately 
the value of the stock purchase rights consists of the discount on the purchase of the stock  of the call option and of the put option 
the call option and put option were valued using the black scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions purchase period ending stock purchase rights may  november  may  november  weighted average expected term years weighted average volatility risk free interest rate expected dividends 
table of contents in addition to the assumptions used to calculate the fair value of our stock based awards  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate of all stock based awards and only recognize expense for those awards we expect to vest 
accordingly  the stock based compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
if we were to change our estimate of forfeiture rates  the amount of stock based compensation expense could differ  materially under certain circumstances  from the amount recognized in our consolidated financial statements 
for example  if we had decreased our estimate of expected forfeitures by  our stock based compensation expense for the year ended december   net of expected forfeitures  would have increased by  this decrease in our estimate of expected forfeitures would increase the amount of expense for all unvested awards that have not yet been recognized by  as of december   which would be amortized over a weighted average period of years 
in addition  if our stock based compensation expense increases in the future  the impact of a change in the estimated forfeiture rate could be more significant 
goodwill our methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques 
goodwill is measured as the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the sum of the amounts assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed 
we evaluate goodwill  at a minimum  on an annual basis and whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of december of each year 
first  impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit s carrying amount book value  including goodwill  to the fair value of the reporting unit 
we have only one reporting unit for the purposes of testing goodwill for impairment 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  a second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
in step two  we calculate the implied fair value of goodwill as the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the fair values assigned to its assets and liabilities 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill  we recognize the difference as an impairment loss 
to determine the fair value of the reporting unit in the current year analysis  we used a weighted average combination of income and market approaches 
the income approach was based on the estimated discounted future cash flows of the reporting unit  including assumptions based on historical and forecasted revenue  operating expenses  taxes and working capital and capital asset requirements 
the market approaches include a market capitalization analysis  guideline public company analysis and a guideline transactions analysis 
the market approach was given a weighting of and the other approaches were equally weighted at 
during the first step of our annual impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of  we determined that the carrying amount of our goodwill might not have been recoverable 
after completing the second step of our december  impairment analysis  we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of million  the result of which is that we do not have any goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  the impairment charge was due to a decline in our market capitalization during the fourth quarter of long lived assets depreciation and amortization of the intangible assets and other long lived assets is provided using the straight line method over their respective estimated useful lives  reflecting the pattern of economic benefits associated with these assets 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances  changes to our business model  or changes in our capital strategy could cause the actual useful lives of intangible assets or other long lived assets to differ from initial estimates 
in those cases where we determine that the useful life of an asset should be revised  we depreciate the remaining net book value over the new estimated useful life 

table of contents we evaluated these assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable based on their future cash flows 
the estimated future cash flows are based upon  among other things  assumptions about expected future operating performance and may differ from actual cash flows 
the assets evaluated for impairment are grouped  based on our judgment  with other assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities 
if the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value of the assets  the assets will be written down to the estimated fair value 
we did not record any asset impairment charges related to finite lived assets during the years ended december  or during the year ended december   we recorded asset impairment charges of million 
valuation of inventories we record inventories at the lower of cost using the first in  first out method or market  after we give appropriate consideration to obsolescence and inventories in excess of anticipated future demand 
in assessing the ultimate recoverability of inventories  we are required to make estimates regarding future customer demand  the timing of new product introductions  economic trends and market conditions 
if the actual product demand is significantly lower than forecasted  we could be required to record additional inventory write downs which would be charged to cost of goods sold 
obsolescence is determined from several factors  including competitiveness of product offerings  market conditions and product life cycles 
increases to the provision for excess and obsolete inventory are charged to cost of goods sold 
at the point of the loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
if this lower cost inventory is subsequently sold  it will result in lower costs and higher gross margin for those products 
any write downs would have an adverse impact on our gross margin 
during the years ended december   and  we recorded excess and obsolete inventory charges of million  million and million  respectively 
warranty liabilities we provide warranties to cover defects in workmanship  materials and manufacturing of our products for a period of one to two years to meet stated functionality specifications 
from time to time  we have agreed  and may agree  to warranty provisions providing for extended terms or with a greater scope 
we test products against specified functionality requirements prior to delivery  but we nevertheless from time to time experience claims under our warranty guarantees 
we accrue for estimated warranty costs under those guarantees based upon historical experience  and for specific items at the time their existence is known and the amounts are determinable 
we charge a provision for estimated future costs related to warranty activities to cost of goods sold based upon historical product failure rates and historical costs incurred in correcting product failures 
if we experience an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience  or if the cost of servicing warranty claims is greater than expected  our gross margin and profitability would be adversely affected 
we recorded warranty expense of million  million and million for each of the years ended december   and  respectively 
accounting for income taxes we record income taxes using the asset and liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
in estimating future tax consequences  generally we consider all expected future events  other than enactments or changes in tax law or rates 
we provide valuation allowances when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
we operate in various tax jurisdictions and are subject to audit by various tax authorities 
we provide for tax contingencies whenever it is deemed probable that a tax asset has been impaired or a tax liability has been incurred for events such as tax claims or changes in tax laws 
tax contingencies are based upon their technical 
table of contents merits  relevant tax law and the specific facts and circumstances as of each reporting period 
changes in facts and circumstances could result in material changes to the amounts recorded for such tax contingencies 
we recognize tax effects of a position only if it is more likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the reporting date 
at december   we had million of unrecognized tax benefits  million of which would affect our effective tax rate if recognized 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we estimate actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets 
at december   we had deferred tax assets  net of deferred tax liabilities  of million  which primarily comprised of us federal and state nol carryforwards 
we also had a related valuation allowance of million  primarily against our us net deferred tax assets  as we believe that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets are not realizable in the foreseeable future 
realizability of deferred tax assets is deemed appropriate when realization of such assets is more likely than not 
based upon the weight of available evidence  which includes our historical operating performance and the recorded us cumulative net losses  we have provided a full valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets 
we intend to maintain valuation allowances until sufficient evidence exists to support the reversal of the valuation allowances 
under certain conditions related to our future profitability and other business factors  we believe it is possible our results will yield sufficient positive evidence to support the conclusion that it is more likely than not that we will realize the tax benefit of our nol carryforwards 
if that is the case  subject to review of other qualitative factors and uncertainties  we would reverse the remaining deferred tax asset valuation allowance as a reduction of tax expense 
for the periods following the recognition of this tax benefit and to the extent we are profitable  we will record a tax provision for which the actual payment may be offset against our accumulated nol carryforwards 
however  our tax rate may significantly increase in future periods 
we make estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans and estimates 
should the actual amounts differ from our estimates  the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted 
any adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in the period that the adjustment is determined to be required 
we pay withholding taxes on royalty income from foreign sources 
in  these payments were offset by a refund from a favorable tax ruling in china and resulted in net impact of zero to our income tax expense 
although there is a us foreign tax credit for foreign income taxes paid  we do not record a benefit from these foreign tax credits  due to our full valuation allowance on our us deferred tax assets 

table of contents results of operations revenue we sell substantially all of our products to original equipment manufacturers  or oems 
we recognize revenue upon delivery of our product to the oem 
we price our products based on market and competitive conditions and may periodically reduce the price of our products as market and competitive conditions change and as manufacturing costs are reduced 
our sales transactions to customers are denominated primarily in chinese renminbi rmb or us dollars 
revenue is driven by the volume of shipments and may be impacted by pricing pressures 
for the year ended december   of our sales were derived from our china based subsidiaries  the majority of which were denominated in rmb 
in addition  we have generated most of our revenue from a limited number of customers 
given the high concentration of network equipment vendors in our industry  our top ten customers represented  and of our revenue in  and  respectively 
years ended december  in thousands total revenue total revenue increased by million in compared to  representing a increase 
the increase in revenue was primarily attributable to increases in demand for our products as carriers continued to deploy fiber to the home solutions and deploy gbps  gbps and other telecom networks 
in addition  our acquisition of santur contributed million of revenue in on a global basis  the increase was primarily realized in china and to a lesser extent in the us total revenue increased by million in compared to  representing a increase 
the increase in revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in demand for our speed and agility products  as customers began to deploy more sophisticated product offerings  plus additional design wins and overall market expansion in although sales increased on a global basis  the increase was primarily realized in china and the us we expect that our revenue for will be higher than our revenue for we also expect that a significant portion of our revenue will continue to be derived from a limited number of customers  as a result of growth in purchases by our key china  us and european customers 
our largest customer  huawei technologies  represented of our total revenue in as a result  the loss of  or a significant reduction in orders from  huawei technologies or any of our other key customers would materially and adversely affect our revenue and results of operations 
we expect a significant portion of our sales to continue to be denominated in rmb  and therefore may be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates 
cost of goods sold and gross margin our cost of goods sold consists primarily of the cost to produce wafers and to manufacture and test our products 
we have a global set of suppliers to help balance considerations related to product availability  quality and cost 
components of our cost of goods sold are denominated primarily in rmb 
our manufacturing process extends from wafer fabrication through final module and subsystem assembly and test 
the cost of our manufacturing  assembly and test processes includes the cost of personnel and the cost of our manufacturing equipment and facilities 
our cost of goods sold is impacted by manufacturing variances such as assembly and test yields and production volume 
we typically experience lower yields and higher associated costs on new products 
in general  our cost of goods sold associated with a particular product declines over time as a result of decreases in wafer costs associated with the increase in the volume of wafers produced  as well as yield improvements and assembly and test enhancements 
additionally  our cost of goods sold includes stock based compensation  reserves for excess and obsolete inventory  royalty payments  amortization of certain purchased intangible assets and acquisition related fair value adjustments  warranty  shipping and allocated facilities costs 

table of contents gross profit as a percentage of total revenue  or gross margin  has been and is expected to continue to be affected by a variety of factors  including the introduction of new products  production volume  production volume compared to sales over time  the mix of products sold  inventory changes  changes in the average selling prices of our products  changes in the cost and volumes of materials purchased from our suppliers  changes in labor costs  changes in overhead costs or requirements  revaluation of stock appreciation unit awards that are impacted by our stock price  and any reserves for excess and obsolete inventories 
our newer and more advanced products typically have higher average selling prices and higher gross margins 
average selling prices by product typically decline as a result of periodic negotiations with our customers and competitive pressures 
we strive to increase our gross margin as we seek to manage the costs of our supply chain and increase productivity in our manufacturing processes 
years ended december  in thousands  except percentages amount of revenue amount of revenue amount of revenue cost of goods sold years ended december  gross margin cost of goods sold increased by million in compared to  representing a increase 
cost of goods sold increased primarily from higher sales volumes and increased employee benefit cost from an increase in payroll taxes in accordance with the new housing fund and minimum wage as required by the shenzhen china government effective as of late and early  respectively  a catch up expense for stock appreciation units previously granted to certain employees as well as the ongoing expense relating to the portion of these awards vesting after our initial public offering in february  and equipment purchases as a result of capacity expansion 
also  in we incurred additional cost of goods sold of million due to the acquisition of santur 
the increase in cost of goods sold was partially offset by overall continuous price reduction efforts in material purchases  improved manufacturing utilization and a decrease in amortization of purchased intangible assets as certain assets became fully amortized 
gross margin was for  compared to for the decrease in gross margin primarily resulted from the increase in sales of our lower margin access products  additional payroll and employee related costs  the impact of lower pricing contracts entered into with customers at the end of the and effective during first half of  and the impact from the acquisition of santur  partially offset by overall continuous pricing reduction in material purchases and higher efficiencies in manufacturing 
cost of goods sold increased by million in compared to  representing a increase 
cost of goods sold increased primarily from higher sales volumes and additional direct labor and overhead costs  offset by lower material costs and improved manufacturing utilization in  and a decrease in amortization of purchased intangible assets  as these assets became fully amortized 
gross margin was for  compared to for the improvement in gross margin primarily resulted from the increase in sales of our higher margin agility products in  combined with higher cost leveraging and lower material costs resulting from manufacturing cost reductions 
we expect that our gross margins are likely to continue to fluctuate as our revenue changes over time due to a number of factors  including those mentioned above 
we also expect to continue to experience increased demand for certain of our products that can have lower than average margins  which can cause our gross margins to be lower than prior years 
in addition  we periodically negotiate pricing with certain customers which can cause our gross margins to fluctuate particularly in the quarters in which the negotiations occurred 
we may experience higher manufacturing labor costs due to future laws and regulations in china  and our gross margins and results of operations may be adversely affected

we record all research and development expense as incurred 
research and development expense increased by million in compared to  representing a increase 
this increase was primarily due to a million increase in additional payroll and employee related costs as a result of increased headcount and our acquisition of santur  and a million per quarter increase in material consumption  facility costs and equipment usage to support more research and development projects 
research and development expense increased by million in compared to  representing a increase 
this increase was primarily due to a million increase in additional payroll and employee related cost in conjunction with increased number of research and development professionals in and a million increase in material usage  project management and design services  and prototype expenses in as we invested in additional resources to support future anticipated demand  partially offset by a million decrease in depreciation as part of our assets were fully depreciated and new assets were placed into service later in we intend to continue to invest in research and development and expect this expense to increase as we grow our business and we anticipate that the cost savings expected to be realized from our fourth quarter restructuring plan will be more than offset by the increase in spending 
as a percentage of total revenue  our research and development expense may vary as our revenue changes over time 

table of contents sales and marketing sales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel costs  including stock based compensation and sales commissions  costs related to sales and marketing programs and services and facility costs 
sales and marketing expense increased by million in compared to  representing a increase 
this increase was primarily due to additional payroll and employee related costs as a result of increased headcount resulting primarily from the acquisition of santur in the fourth quarter of sales and marketing expense increased by million in compared to  representing a increase 
the increase was primarily due to an increase in employee related costs and sales commissions 
we expect our sales and marketing expense to increase in as a result of the acquisition of santur and as we grow our business  expand our marketing activities  increase the number of sales and marketing professionals and incur higher stock based compensation expense and employee related costs accordingly 
as a percentage of total revenue  our sales and marketing expense may vary as our revenue changes over time

this was primarily due to a million increase in additional payroll and employee related costs as a result of higher headcount and the acquisition of santur  a million increase in business tax mainly related to city construction tax and educational surtax as required by the chinese government  a million increase in facilities related costs  and a million increase in professional services expense related to public company compliance expenses and legal fees 
general and administrative expense increased by million in compared to  representing a increase 
this increase was primarily due to increases in legal costs of million  personnel costs of million  and increases in accounting and tax related costs of million  partially offset by lower facilities related costs of million 
we expect our general and administrative expense to increase as we incur costs associated with being a public company and as we expand and grow our operations and business 
as a percentage of total revenue  our general and administrative expense may vary as our revenue changes over time 
amortization of purchased intangible assets we completed a series of business acquisitions in and and  mostly recently  in the fourth quarter of  which included the acquisition of intangible assets 
these intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives 
amortization expense relating to technology and patents and leasehold interests are includes within cost of goods sold  while customer relationships and noncompete agreements are recorded within operating expenses 
amortization of purchased intangible assets within operating expenses decreased by million in compared to  representing a decrease 
the decreases were primarily due to some of those assets acquired in and becoming fully amortized in the second half of  partially offset by an increase in amortization expense related to those assets acquired from santur in october 
table of contents amortization of purchased intangible assets within operating expenses remained flat in compared to  as we continued to amortize intangible assets associated with business acquisitions made prior to we expect our amortization of purchased intangible assets to increase due to the acquisition of santur in october we expect amortization of intangible assets to be approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively  of which approximately million  million and million is expected to be recorded within operating expenses 
adjustment to the fair value of contingent consideration in connection with our acquisition of santur  we may be required to pay up to an additional million in cash as further consideration for the business acquisition  contingent upon santur s gross profit performance during as of the closing date of the acquisition  the fair value of the contingent consideration was estimated to be million 
the fair value of the contingent consideration is remeasured each reporting period and any changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognized as a gain or loss in the consolidated statements of operations 
as of december   we estimated the fair value of the contingent consideration was million and  as a result  we recorded a million adjustment during the fourth quarter of as a result of changes in demand and product mix with santur s products subsequent to the acquisition date 
the impact resulted in lower expected gross margins to be realized during the contingent consideration earning period 
the adjustment to the fair value of contingent consideration is based on individual facts and circumstances and is not otherwise considered a recurring expense 
although we have recognized an adjustment in  this is not necessarily indicative of future periods 
goodwill impairment charge due to the decrease in our market capitalization as of the end of the fourth quarter of  we determined that the indicators of impairment existed and that the carrying value of our goodwill may not be recoverable 
as a result  we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of million  representing the entire balance of our goodwill 
as of december   we had no goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet 
asset impairment charges we record asset impairment charges when it is determined that the carrying value of our assets is not recoverable 
we did not incur any asset impairment charges in and compared to million in in  we entered into an agreement to sell our ownership interest in shenzhen archcom technology co  ltd  or archcom  for million  which was less than our share of the value in the net assets of archcom 
this transaction was completed as of march  as a result  we recognized an impairment charge of million in the year ended december   of which million was related to tangible fixed assets and the remaining million was recorded as an accrual for the expected loss on sale 
in addition  in  we recorded an impairment charge of million resulting from the write off of machinery and equipment no longer in use 
asset impairment charges are based on individual facts and circumstances and are not otherwise considered a recurring expense 
although we have recognized asset impairment charges in and  this is not necessarily indicative of future periods

in addition  we made reductions in the areas of sales  marketing and administrative functions as a result of redundancy in positions due to the acquisition of santur in october as a result  we recorded a restructuring charge of million for severance and benefit costs 
as of december   substantially all of the restructuring expense had been paid 
we anticipate that the cost saving associated with these restructuring activities will be realized in  but will be more than offset by increases in our operating expenses associated with increased costs resulting from our acquisition of santur and additional costs incurred as we expand and grow our business 
interest and other income expense  net interest income consists of income earned on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
interest expense consists of amounts paid for interest on our short term and long term debt borrowings 
in  other income expense  net is primarily made up of gains from the sale of equity shares of an unconsolidated investee  an unconsolidated investee 
other income expense also includes government subsidies  share of loss of an unconsolidated investee and foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
the functional currency of our subsidiaries in china is the rmb and the foreign currency transaction gains and losses of our subsidiaries in china primarily result from their transactions in us dollars 
years ended december  in thousands interest income interest expense other income expense  net total interest and other income expense  net total interest and other income expense  net increased by million in compared to the increase was primarily related to a gain of million from the sale of an unconsolidated investee in  and the equity loss of million on an unconsolidated investee in  a million increase in interest income related to our investment in securities  and a million decrease in interest expense as a result of our lower loan balances outstanding in both the us and china on a weighted average basis total interest and other income expense  net remained relatively flat in  as compared to we realized a reduction in interest expense associated with lower outstanding debt in  which was partially offset by a reduction in interest income  primarily due to lower cash balances 
in the future  interest income will depend on our average cash balances and our investment decisions 
we expect our interest income to remain relatively modest given the low yields available in the marketplace and lower investable balances 
we also expect our interest expense to increase as we borrowed million in october to partially pay the purchase price for our acquisition of santur 
income taxes we conduct our business globally 
therefore  our operating income is subject to varying rates of tax in the us  china and other various foreign jurisdictions 
consequently  our effective tax rate is dependent upon the geographic distribution of our earnings or losses and the tax laws and regulations in each geographical region 
we expect that our income taxes will vary in relation to our profitability and the geographic distribution of our profits 
historically  we have experienced net losses in the us and in the short term  we expect this trend to continue 
in china  one of our subsidiaries has qualified for a preferential tax rate available for high technology enterprises 
the preferential rate applies to  and we realized benefits from this reduction in tax rate of million  million  and million for  and  respectively 
we have reapplied for the preferential rate for if approved  the rate will remain at for and  
table of contents otherwise  the rate will be for and thereafter 
in  our cash tax liability in china was partially offset by the utilization of nol carryforwards 
in future periods  we expect that our operations in china will not have sufficient nol carryforwards to offset any future cash tax obligation in china 
years ended december  in thousands  except percentages provision for income taxes effective tax rate our effective tax rate was negative in  compared with an effective tax rate of in our operating income is subject to varying rates of tax in the us and foreign jurisdictions 
consequently  our effective tax rate is dependent upon the geographic distribution of our earnings or losses and the tax laws and regulations in each geographical region 
in  our income tax expense incurred was primarily related to the operating profit realized in our foreign subsidiaries  despite a consolidated loss before income taxes 
in  our tax expense incurred was also primarily related to the earnings generated by our foreign subsidiaries 
our withholding taxes on royalty income from foreign sources were offset by a refund from a favorable tax ruling in china and resulted in net impact of zero to our income tax expense in our effective tax rate was in  compared with an effective tax rate of negative in in  we incurred tax expense despite a consolidated loss before income taxes  primarily due to foreign income taxes paid based on earnings generated by our foreign subsidiaries of million and withholding taxes on royalties received from our foreign subsidiaries of million 
liquidity and capital resources until the consummation of our initial public offering in february  we financed our operations through private sales of equity securities and cash generated from operations and from various lending arrangements 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents totaled million and our short term investments totaled million 
cash and cash equivalents were held for working capital purposes and were invested primarily in money market funds 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  and cash flows from our operating activities  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate  the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts  the expansion of sales and marketing activities  the introduction of new and enhanced products  the costs to increase our manufacturing capacity  the continuing market acceptance of our products and acquisitions of businesses and technology 
in the event that additional financing is required from outside sources  we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all 
if we are unable to raise additional capital when desired  our business  operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected 
a customary business practice in china is for customers to exchange our accounts receivable with notes receivable issued by their bank 
from time to time we accept notes receivable from certain of our customers in china 
these notes receivable are non interest bearing and are generally due within six months  and such notes receivable may be redeemed with the issuing bank prior to maturity at a discount 
historically  we have collected on the notes receivable in full at the time of maturity 
frequently  we also direct our banking partners to issue notes payable to our suppliers in china in exchange for accounts payable 
our chinese subsidiaries banks issue the notes to vendors and issue payment to the vendors upon redemption 
we owe the payable balance to the issuing bank 
the notes payable are non interest bearing and are generally due within six months of issuance 
as a condition of the notes payable lending arrangements  we are required to keep a compensating balance at the issuing banks that is a percentage of the total notes payable balance until the notes payable are paid by our subsidiaries in china 
these balances are classified as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheets 
as of december   our restricted cash totaled million

our primary subsidiary in china had a million line of credit facility with a hong kong bank 
this line of credit agreement was supported by letters of credit issued pursuant to our us loan and security agreement  as referenced above 
in september  we eliminated the million letter of credit and there was no capacity available under the line of credit 
our us loan and security agreement requires us to maintain specified financial covenants  including a liquidity ratio  and restricts our ability to incur additional debt or to engage in specified transactions and is secured by substantially all of our us assets  other than intellectual property assets

recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  reached a final consensus on new revenue recognition guidance regarding revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the new accounting guidance addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting  and how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of 
table of contents accounting 
the new accounting guidance became effective for the company beginning january  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in january  the fasb issued amended guidance on fair value measurements and disclosures 
the new guidance requires additional disclosures regarding fair value measurements  amends disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets  and provides clarification regarding the level of disaggregation of fair value disclosures by investment class 
this guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for certain level activity disclosure requirements that were effective for reporting periods beginning after december  level assets and liabilities are those whose fair market value inputs are unobservable and reflect management s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date 
accordingly  the company adopted this amendment for the year ended december   except for the additional level requirements which were adopted on january  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in april  the fasb issued an accounting standard update which provides guidance on the criteria to be followed in recognizing revenue under the milestone method 
the milestone method of recognition allows a vendor who is involved with the provision of deliverables to recognize the full amount of a milestone payment upon achievement  if  at the inception of the revenue arrangement  the milestone is determined to be substantive as defined in the standard 
the guidance is effective for the company on a prospective basis for milestones achieved beginning january  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued amendments to the fasb accounting standard codification relating to fair value measurements 
the amendments clarify the application of existing fair value measurement requirements and results in common measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs 
the amendments are effective for the company during interim and annual periods beginning after december  early application by public entities is not permitted 
the company will apply these amendments prospectively beginning in fiscal the company is currently evaluating the impact the application of these amendments will have on the consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued amendments to the fasb accounting standard codification relating to presentation of comprehensive income 
the amendments require that all non owner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the amendments also required entities to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in both the statement in which net income is presented and the statement in which other comprehensive income is presented 
in december  the fasb issued guidance which indefinitely defers the guidance related to the presentation of reclassification adjustments 
the amendments should be applied retrospectively  and are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  the company will apply the guidance beginning january  and the application of this guidance will result in financial statement presentation changes only 
in august  the fasb approved a revised accounting standard update intended to simplify how an entity tests goodwill for impairment 
the amendments permit an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
the amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  and early adoption is permitted 
the company will apply this guidance beginning january  in december  the fasb issued amendments to the accounting standard codification enhancing disclosure requirements about the nature of an entity s right to offset 
the new guidance requires the disclosure 
table of contents of the gross amounts subject to rights of set off  amounts offset in accordance with the accounting standards followed  and the related net exposure 
the new guidance is effective for both interim and annual reporting period beginning january  other than requiring additional disclosures  the company does not anticipate material impacts on our financial statements upon adoption 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate fluctuation risk our cash equivalents consisted primarily of money market funds and interest and non interest bearing bank deposits 
the main objective of these instruments was safety of principal and liquidity while maximizing return  without significantly increasing risk 
given the short term nature of our cash equivalents  we do not anticipate any material effect on our portfolio due to fluctuations in interest rates 
we started to invest our excess cash in short term and long term marketable securities in to take advantage of higher yields generated by these investments 
as of december   the gross unrealized gains or losses on our investments classified as available for sale were primarily due to increases or decreases in the fair value of the marketable securities as a result of changes in market interest rates 
we have determined that the gross unrealized gains or losses on the available for sale securities at december  are temporary in nature 
we may sell these marketable securities investments in the future to fund future operating needs 
as a result  we recorded all our marketable securities in short term investments as of december   regardless of the contractual maturity date of the securities 
we are exposed to market risk due to the possibility of changing interest rates associated with certain outstanding balances under our debt instruments 
as of december   we did not have outstanding debt in china 
as of december   our us debt was based on floating rates of interest and is subject to fluctuations in interest rates 
as of december   the interest rates on all of our outstanding debt in china were fixed at the time of drawdown  and were not subject to fluctuations 
as of december   a portion of our us debt was based on floating rates of interest and is subject to fluctuations in interest rates 
as of december  and  we had not hedged our interest rate risk 
as of december  and  we had million and million outstanding under our us credit facilities  respectively  which was subject to fluctuations in interest rates 
as of december  and  the weighted average interest rate on the million and the million of outstanding principal subject to interest rate fluctuations was and  respectively 
for the year ended december   a hypothetical increase in the interest rate could result in approximately  of additional annual interest expense 
comparatively  for the year ended december   a hypothetical increase in the interest rate could result in approximately  of additional annual interest 
the hypothetical changes and assumptions made above will be different from what actually occurs in the future 
furthermore  the computations do not anticipate actions that may be taken by our management should the hypothetical market changes actually occur over time 
as a result  actual impacts on our results of operations in the future will differ from those quantified above 
foreign currency exchange risk foreign currency exchange rates are subject to fluctuation and may cause us to recognize transaction gains and losses in our statement of operations 
a substantial portion of our business is conducted through our subsidiaries in china whose functional currency is the rmb 
to the extent that transactions by our subsidiaries in china are denominated in currencies other than rmb  we bear the risk that fluctuations in the exchange rates of the rmb in relation to other currencies could decrease our revenue and increase our costs and expenses 
during the years ended december  and  we recognized foreign currency transaction losses of million and million  respectively 
we use the us dollar as the reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements 
any significant revaluation of the rmb may materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
table of contents upon translation of our chinese subsidiaries financial statements into us dollars 
while we generate a majority of our revenue in rmb  a majority of our operating expenses are in us dollars 
therefore depreciation in rmb against the us dollar would negatively impact our revenue upon translation to the us dollars but the impact on operating expenses would be less 
for example  for the year ended december   a depreciation in rmb against the us dollar would have resulted in an million decrease in our revenue and a million increase in our net loss for the period 
comparatively  for the year ended december   a depreciation in rmb against the us dollar would have resulted in a million decrease in our revenue and a million decrease in our net income for the period 
to date  we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
while we may decide to enter into hedging transactions in the future  the availability and effectiveness of these hedging transactions may be limited and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure 
in addition  our currency exchange variations may be magnified by any chinese exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to convert rmb into foreign currency 
inflation risk inflationary factors  such as increases in our cost of goods sold and operating expenses  may adversely affect our results of operations 
although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date  an increase in the rate of inflation in the future  particularly in china  may have an adverse effect on our levels of gross profit and operating expenses as a percentage of revenue if the sales prices for our products do not proportionately increase with these increased expenses
