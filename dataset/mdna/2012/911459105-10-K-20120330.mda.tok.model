capital standards 
the frb has risk based capital adequacy guidelines intended to provide a measure of capital adequacy that reflects the degree of risk associated with a banking organization s operations for both transactions reported on the balance sheet as assets  and transactions  such as letters of credit and recourse arrangements  which are reported as off balance sheet items 
under these guidelines  nominal dollar amounts of assets and credit equivalent amounts of off balance sheet items are multiplied by one of several risk adjustment percentages  which range from for assets with low credit risk  such as certain us government securities  to for assets with relatively higher credit risk  such as business loans 
a banking organization s risk based capital ratios are obtained by dividing its qualifying capital by its total risk adjusted assets and off balance sheet items 
the regulators measure risk adjusted assets and off balance sheet items against both total qualifying capital the sum of tier capital and limited amounts of tier capital and tier capital 
tier capital consists of common stock  retained earnings  noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in certain subsidiaries  less most other intangible assets 
tier capital may consist of a limited amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses and certain other instruments with some characteristics of equity

for a banking organization rated in the highest of the five categories used by regulators to rate banking organizations  the minimum leverage ratio of tier capital to total assets is 
it is improbable  however  that an institution with a leverage ratio would receive the highest rating by the regulators since a strong capital position is a significant part of the regulators ratings

a bank that does not achieve and maintain the required capital levels may be issued a capital directive by the fdic to ensure the maintenance of required capital levels

an institution that  based upon its capital levels  is classified as well capitalized  adequately capitalized  or undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency  after notice and opportunity for hearing  determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or an unsafe or unsound practice warrants such treatment 
at each successive lower capital category  an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions 
of

of 
table of contents regulatory order from the california department of financial institutions during may of  the california department of financial institutions issued a written order the order pursuant to section of the california financial code to the bank as a result of a regulatory examination that was conducted by the federal reserve and the california department of financial institutions in june the order issued by the california department of financial institutions is basically similar to the written agreement with the federal reserve bank of san francisco  except for certain additional requirements 
the additional requirements in the order for the bank are as follows develop and adopt a capital plan to maintain a ratio of tangible shareholders equity to total tangible assets equal to or greater than and include in such capital plan a capital contingency plan for raising additional capital in the event of various contingencies  maintain a ratio of tangible shareholders equity to total tangible assets equal to or greater than maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses and remedy any deficiency in the allowance for loan losses in the calendar quarter in which it is discovered  and not establish any new branches or other offices without the prior written consent of the commissioner of the california department of financial institutions  provide progress reports within days after the end of each calendar quarter following the date of the order to the california department of financial institutions detailing the form and manner of all actions taken to secure compliance with the order and agreement and the results of such actions 
the bank is currently in full compliance with the requirements of the order including its deadlines 
effect of governmental policies and recent legislation banking has traditionally been a business that depends on rate differentials 
in general  the difference between the interest rate paid by the company on its deposits and other borrowings and the interest rate received on loans extended to its customers and securities held in the company s portfolio comprise the major portion of the company s earnings 
these rates are highly sensitive to many factors which are beyond the control of the company 
accordingly  the earnings and growth of the company are subject to the influence of domestic and foreign economic conditions  including  but not limited to  inflation  recession and unemployment 
impact of monetary policies 
the earnings and growth of the company are affected not only by general economic conditions  both domestic and foreign  but also by the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states government and its agencies  particularly the federal reserve board frb 
the frb implements national monetary policies with objectives such as to curb inflation and combat recession by its open market operations in united states government securities  by adjusting the required level of reserves for financial institutions subject to reserve requirements  and by varying the discount rates applicable to borrowing by banks which are members of the federal reserve system 
the actions of the frb in these areas influence the growth of bank loans  investments and deposits and also affect interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits 
the frb s policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
the nature and timing of any future changes in monetary policies are not predictable 
in addition  adverse economic conditions could make a higher provision for loan losses a prudent course and could cause higher loan charge offs  thus adversely affecting the company s net income 
extensions of credit to insiders and transactions with affiliates 
the federal reserve act and frb regulation o place limitations and conditions on loans or extensions of credit to a bank s or bank holding company s executive officers  directors and principal shareholders ie  in most cases  those persons who own  control or have power to vote more than of any class of voting securities  any company controlled by any such executive officer  director or shareholder  or any political or campaign committee controlled by such executive officer  director or principal shareholder 
of 
table of contents loans and leases extended to any of the above persons must comply with loan to one borrower limits  require prior full board approval when aggregate extensions of credit to the person exceed specified amounts  must be made on substantially the same terms including interest rates and collateral as  and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than  those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non insiders  and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features 
in addition  regulation o provides that the aggregate limit on extensions of credit to all insiders of a bank as a group cannot exceed the bank s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus 
regulation o also prohibits a bank from paying an overdraft on an account of an executive officer or director  except pursuant to a written pre authorized interest bearing extension of credit plan that specifies a method of repayment or a written pre authorized transfer of funds from another account of the officer or director at the bank 
consumer protection laws and regulations 
the banking regulatory agencies are focusing greater attention on compliance with consumer protection laws and their implementing regulations 
examination and enforcement have become more intense in nature  and insured institutions have been advised to monitor carefully compliance with such laws and regulations 
the company is subject to many federal and state consumer protection and privacy statutes and regulations  some of which are discussed below 
the community reinvestment act the cra is intended to encourage insured depository institutions  while operating safely and soundly  to help meet the credit needs of their communities 
the cra specifically directs the federal regulatory agencies  in examining insured depository institutions  to assess a bank s record of helping meet the credit needs of its entire community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods  consistent with safe and sound banking practices 
the cra further requires the agencies to take a financial institution s record of meeting its community credit needs into account when evaluating applications for  among other things  domestic branches  mergers or acquisitions  or holding company formations 
the agencies use the cra assessment factors in order to provide a rating to the financial institution 
the ratings range from a high of outstanding to a low of substantial noncompliance 
in its last examination for cra compliance  as of september  the bank was rated satisfactory 
the equal credit opportunity act the ecoa generally prohibits discrimination in any credit transaction  whether for consumer or business purposes  on the basis of race  color  religion  national origin  sex  marital status  age except in limited circumstances  receipt of income from public assistance programs  or good faith exercise of any rights under the consumer credit protection act 
the truth in lending act the tila is designed to ensure that credit terms are disclosed in a meaningful way so that consumers may compare credit terms more readily and knowledgeably 
as a result of the tila  all creditors must use the same credit terminology to express rates and payments  including the annual percentage rate  the finance charge  the amount financed  the total of payments and the payment schedule  among other things 
the fair housing act the fh act regulates many practices  including making it unlawful for any lender to discriminate in its housing related lending activities against any person because of race  color  religion  national origin  sex  handicap or familial status 
a number of lending practices have been found by the courts to be  or may be considered  illegal under the fh act  including some that are not specifically mentioned in the fh act itself 
the home mortgage disclosure act the hmda  in response to public concern over credit shortages in certain urban neighborhoods  requires public disclosure of information that shows whether financial institutions are serving the housing credit needs of the neighborhoods and communities in which they are located 
the hmda also includes a fair lending aspect that requires the collection and disclosure of data about applicant and borrower characteristics as a way of identifying possible discriminatory lending patterns and enforcing anti discrimination statutes 
the right to financial privacy act the rfpa imposes a new requirement for financial institutions to provide new privacy protections to consumers 
financial institutions must provide disclosures to consumers of its privacy policy  and state the rights of consumers to direct their financial institution not to share their nonpublic personal information with third parties 
finally  the real estate settlement procedures act the respa requires lenders to provide noncommercial borrowers with disclosures regarding the nature and cost of real estate settlements 
also  respa prohibits certain abusive practices  such as kickbacks  and places limitations on the amount of escrow accounts 
penalties for noncompliance or violations under the above laws may include fines  reimbursement and other penalties 
due to heightened regulatory concern related to compliance with cra  ecoa  tila  fh act  hmda  rfpa and respa generally  the company may incur additional compliance costs or be required to expend additional funds for investments in its local communities

table of contents from time to time  legislation is enacted which has the effect of increasing the cost of doing business  limiting or expanding permissible activities or affecting the competitive balance between banks and other financial institutions 
proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the operations and taxation of banks and other financial institutions are frequently made in congress  in the california legislature and before various bank regulatory agencies 
the likelihood of any major change and the impact such change may have on the company is impossible to predict 
certain of the potentially significant changes which have been enacted recently and other which are currently under consideration by congress or various regulatory agencies or professional agencies are discussed below 
recent legislation and other changes federal and state laws affecting banking are enacted from time to time  and similarly federal and state regulations affecting banking are also adopted from time to time

temporary gift and estate tax is also included in the tax relief act

the tax relief act also extends on a temporary basis the bonus depreciation for taxable years and for small businesses  the maximum amount and phase out threshold under section for taxable years are set at  and  respectively  indexed for inflation 
the law also provided a one year reauthorization of federal ui benefits and cuts fica taxes for employees to percent and those self employed to percent on self employment income up to  the small business jobs act of sba jobs act enacted in september provides numerous tax breaks for small businesses including start up small businesses  and more importantly for insured financial institutions eligibility for participation in a u s treasury program that will provide a maximum billion for purchases of preferred stock and other debt instruments issued by eligible financial institutions for the purpose of increasing credit availability for small businesses 
in addition  there are important changes to various sba loan administration programs to aid small businesses under the sba jobs act 
the sba jobs act provides for increasing maximum individual loan limits of sba loans  extending the higher government guarantee level and waiver of borrower fees for certain sba loans  and allowing alternative underwriting measures  specifically net worth and net income to allow more small businesses to participate in certain sba loans 
the dodd frank act  signed into law in july   will significantly change the current bank regulatory structure and affect the lending  investment  trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies 
the dodd frank act creates of a new interagency council  the financial system oversight council that is charged with identifying and monitoring the systemic risk to the us economy posed by systemically significant  large financial companies  including bank holding companies and non bank financial companies 
the office of thrift supervision will be eliminated and its powers distributed among the office of the comptroller of the currency  the federal reserve board and the fdic 
the legislation also establishes a floor for capital of insured depository institutions that cannot be lower than the standards in effect today  and directs the federal banking regulators to implement new leverage and capital requirements within months that take into account off balance sheet activities and other risks  including risks relating to securitized products and derivatives 
the dodd frank act also creates a new consumer financial protection bureau with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws 
the consumer financial protection bureau has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions such as the bank  including the authority to prohibit unfair  deceptive or abusive acts and practices 
the consumer financial protection bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than billion in assets 
banks and savings institutions with billion or less in assets will be examined by their applicable bank regulators 
the new legislation also weakens the federal preemption available for national banks and federal savings associations  and gives state attorneys general the ability to enforce applicable federal consumer protection laws 
of 
table of contents the legislation also broadens the base for fdic insurance assessments 
assessments will now be based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution 
the dodd frank act also permanently increases the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks  savings institutions and credit unions to  per depositor  retroactive to january   and non interest bearing transaction accounts have unlimited deposit insurance through december  the dodd frank act also repeals the prohibition on payment of interest on demand deposits 
section of the dodd frank act eliminates interstate branching restrictions that were implemented as part of the riegle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of  and removes many restrictions on de novo interstate branching by national and state chartered banks 
the fdic and the occ now have authority to approve applications by insured state nonmember banks and national banks  respectively  to establish de novo branches in states other than the bank s home state if the law of the state in which the branch is located  or is to be located  would permit establishment of the branch  if the bank were a state bank chartered by such state 
the enactment of this section may significantly increase interstate banking by community banks in western states  where barriers to entry were previously high many of the provisions of the dodd frank act will not take effect for at least a year  and the legislation requires various federal agencies to promulgate numerous and extensive implementing regulations over the next several years 
although the substance and scope of these regulations cannot be determined at this time  it is expected that the legislation and implementing regulations  particularly those provisions relating to the new consumer financial protection bureau  will increase the bank s operating and compliance costs as it is likely that the bank s existing regulatory agencies will adopt the same or similar consumer protections as the new consumer financial protection bureau will adopt 
on june   the federal banking agencies issued final guidance on incentive compensation 
the final guidance is largely unchanged from the frb s preliminary guidance published in  with the exception of a few adjustments clarifications in response to feedback the frb received during the open comment period 
the guidance became effective on june  the date published in the federal register  and applies to all banks 
except for the largest banking organizations  enforcement of this guidance will be handled through the supervisors regular risk focused examination process 
the guidance is principles based  rather than prescriptive  and also identifies expectations of large banking organizations that go beyond what will be expected of community banks  and emphasizes that the application of the guidance should be scaled appropriately for the complexity of the organization and the extent to which incentive arrangements are utilized 
the employees covered by the final guidance are senior executives and others who are responsible for oversight of the organization s firm wide activities or material business lines  individual employees  including non executive employees  whose activities may expose the organization to material amounts of risk  and groups of employees who are subject to the same or similar incentive compensation arrangements and who  in the aggregate  may expose the organization to material amounts of risk  even if no individual employee is likely to expose the organization to material risk 
the guidance provides for three principles for safe and sound incentive compensation arrangements balanced risk taking incentive compensation arrangements should balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risks  compatibility with effective controls and risk management a banking organization s risk management processes and internal controls should reinforce and support the development and maintenance of balanced incentive compensation arrangements  strong corporate governance banking organizations should have strong and effective corporate governance to help ensure sound compensation practices  including active and effective oversight by the board of directors 
the electronic funds transfer act the efta provides a basic framework for establishing the rights  liabilities  and responsibilities of consumers who use electronic funds transfer eft systems 
the efta is implemented by the federal reserve s regulation e  which governs transfers initiated through atms  point of sale terminals  payroll cards  automated clearinghouse ach transactions  telephone bill payment plans  or remote banking services

the new law allows interest rate hikes on existing balances only under limited conditions  such as when a promotional rate ends  there is a variable rate or if the cardholder makes a late payment 
interest rates on new transactions can increase only after the first year 
significant changes in terms on accounts cannot occur without days advance notice of the change 
the new law bans raising interest rates on customers based on their payment records with other unrelated credit issuers such as utility companies and other creditors for existing credit card balances  though card issuers would still be allowed to use universal default on future credit card balances if they give at least days advance notice of the change 
the new law allows consumers to opt out of certain significant changes in terms on their accounts

credit card issuers would no longer be able to set early morning or other arbitrary deadlines for payments 
when consumers have accounts that carry different interest rates for different types of purchases payments in excess of the minimum amount due must go to balances with higher interest rates first 
consumers must opt in to over limit fees 
those who opt out would have their transactions rejected if they exceed their credit limits  thus avoiding over limit fees 
fees charged for going over the limit must be reasonable 
finance charges on outstanding credit card balances would be computed based on purchases made in the current cycle rather than going back to the previous billing cycle to calculate interest charges 
fees on credit cards cannot exceed percent of the available credit limit in the first year of the card 
credit card issuers must disclose to cardholders the consequences of making only minimum payments each month  namely how long it would take to pay off the entire balance if users only made the minimum monthly payment 
issuers must also provide information on how much users must pay each month if they want to pay off their balances in months  including the amount of interest

on october   the federal reserve board issued a comprehensive proposal on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk taking 
the proposal  which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization  either individually or as part of a group  is based upon the key principles that a banking organization s incentive compensation arrangements should i provide incentives that do not encourage risk taking beyond the organization s ability to effectively identify and manage risks  ii be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management  and iii be supported by strong corporate governance  including active and effective oversight by the organization s board of directors 
the proposal also contemplates a detailed review by the federal reserve board of the incentive compensation policies and practices of a number of large  complex banking organizations 
any deficiencies in compensation practices that are identified may be incorporated into the organization s supervisory ratings  which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions 
in addition  the proposal provides that enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related risk management control or governance processes pose a risk to the organization s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies 
similarly  on january   the fdic announced that it would seek public comment through advance notice of rule making on whether banks with compensation plans that encourage risky behavior should be charged at higher deposit assessment rates than such banks would otherwise be charged 
on september   the us treasury issued a policy statement entitled principles for reforming the us and international regulatory capital framework for banking firms 
the statement was developed in consultation with the us bank regulatory agencies and sets forth eight core principles intended to shape a new international capital accord 
six of the core principles relate directly to bank capital requirements 
the statement contemplates changes to the existing regulatory capital regime that would involve substantial revisions to  if not replacement of  major parts of the basel i and basel ii and affect all regulated banking organizations and other systemically important institutions 
the statement calls for higher and stronger capital requirements for bank and non bank financial firms that are deemed to pose a risk to financial stability due to their combination of size  leverage  interconnectedness and liquidity risk 
the statement suggested that changes to the regulatory capital framework be phased in over a period of several years with a recommended schedule providing for a comprehensive international agreement by december   with the implementation of reforms by december   although it does remain possible that us bank regulatory agencies could officially adopt  or informally implement  new capital standards at an earlier date 
following the issuance of the statement  on december   the basel committee issued a set of proposals the capital proposals that would significantly revise the definitions of tier capital and tier capital  with the most significant changes being to tier capital 
most notably  the capital proposals would disqualify certain structured capital instruments  such as trust preferred securities  from tier capital status 
the capital proposals would also re emphasize that common equity is the predominant component of tier capital by adding a minimum common equity to risk weighted assets ratio and requiring that goodwill  general intangibles and certain other items that currently must be deducted from tier capital instead be deducted from common equity as a component of tier capital 
the capital proposals also leave open the possibility that the basel committee will recommend changes to the minimum tier capital and total capital ratios of and  respectively 
concurrently with the release of the capital proposals  the basel committee also released a set of proposals related to liquidity risk exposure the liquidity proposals 
the liquidity proposals have three key elements  including the implementation of i a liquidity coverage ratio designed to ensure that a bank maintains an adequate level of unencumbered  high quality assets sufficient to meet the bank s liquidity needs over a day time horizon under an acute liquidity stress scenario  ii a net stable funding ratio designed to promote more medium and long term funding of the assets and activities of banks over a one year time horizon  and iii a set of monitoring tools that the basel committee indicates should be considered as the minimum types of information that banks should report to supervisors and that supervisors should use in monitoring the liquidity risk profiles of supervised entities

of 
table of contents the agreement entered into with the federal reserve bank of san francisco during march was a result of a regulatory examination conducted by the federal reserve and the california department of financial institutions in june the following issues related to the june examination led to the agreement between the federal reserve bank and the company that corrective action was required asset quality continued to deteriorate as adversely classified assets increased over four consecutive target and full scope examinations conducted from through the june exam 
the dollar volume of adversely classified assets increased by during the six months prior to the exam to million at the june examination 
below investment grade investment securities classified substandard at the previous examination totaling million increased to million at the june examination  representing of tier capital and reserves as of march  the classified investment securities are comprised of three private label residential mortgage backed securities that are below investment grade as graded by a national rating agency  were divided between million in substandard and  in loss 
the portion listed as loss represented the amount identified as other than temporary impairment otti and had been recognized as loss as of march  during the june examination  it was the opinion of the federal reserve bank that the bank s methodology related to the allowance for loan and leases losses was flawed  leading the federal reserve bank to conclude that additional provisions were required to raise reserves to an appropriate level 
in addition  weaknesses in the alll policy were identified and needed to be addressed  which included improvements in documentation related to identification and analysis of loans under sfas no 
and sfas no 
 and more detailed justification for the qualitative factors used in the alll process 
during the six months ended june   several large lending relationships to developers in the san joaquin valley deteriorated significantly  requiring an additional million in alll 
in addition  during that period  the bank experienced increases in other problem loans or potentially problem loans including nonaccrual loans and special mention loans  and real estate valuations continued to decline 
regulators required an increase in the reserves as calculated by the federal reserve bank using a model they call the atlanta model 
the atlanta model calculated an estimated range of allowance for loan losses using a blend of national  regional  and local peer bank data 
the reserve calculated by the bank for june  under gaap included additions to alll required for increases in adversely classified and special mention loans experienced during the first half of  and although at the lower range of alll as estimated by the federal reserve  corresponded favorably with the federal reserves atlanta model 
the reserve adjustment required for the second quarter of totaled million bringing the alll level to million including reserve for unfunded commitments at june  the alll findings of the federal reserve bank included recommendations to better align actual practices with the regulatory governing policy as well as to provide a more specific framework for analyzing  determining  and supporting the factors used in the alll methodology 
earnings performance declined as of june   due in large part to the additional million provision recorded for the second quarter million year to date resulting in a net loss for the company of million for the six months ended june  earnings for the period were also adversely impacted by a goodwill impairment loss of million pre tax and net  year to date pre tax impairment losses of  on the real estate mortgage backed securities  year to date pre tax operating expenses and impairment losses of million related to other real estate owned through foreclosure 
although the bank s tier leverage capital  tier risk based capital  and total risk based capital ratios remained above regulatory prompt corrective action guidelines of adequately capitalized banks at   and  respectively  at june   the federal reserve concluded that capital levels were less than adequate to support the bank s high risk profile resulting primarily from the continued decline in asset quality 
at the june examination adversely classified assets were in excess of of tier capital and reserves 
the bank s liquidity position had tightened since the last examination and was considered marginal at the june examination 
the bank s tight liquidity position was the result of low levels of liquid assets  high percentage of investment securities pledged against borrowing lines  and higher levels of wholesale borrowings including million borrowed from the federal home loan bank line and million borrowed from the federal reserve bank discount window 
brokered deposits total million  of total deposits at june   and compared unfavorably with the peer group at 
the federal reserve concluded in the june examination that oversight by the board of directors and senior management was not adequate given the escalating risk profile of the bank s activities although the severe economic downturn was a significant factor in the decline in asset quality  the board of directors and senior management were deemed responsible for implementing a business strategy which allowed concentrations in higher risk speculative residential construction lending 
the board of directors and senior management had taken measures to maintain asset quality  capital  earnings  and liquidity  but had had not responded in a timely manner to the rapidly changing real estate conditions 
as of march   the concentration in construction and land development loans represented high levels in relation to equity capital and reserves  although the exposures were declining over the prior few years 
for example  management increased the alll in the second quarter of  ordered new appraisals on property remargined collateral on loans  and was seeking sources for new equity capital 
in addition  several transactions to reduce or restructure problem assets were in process 
however  these actions had not resulted in material tangible improvements in the overall condition of the bank as of the june examination 
in addition  the june examination identified nine technical violations of regulation y subpart b that deal with the failure to obtain the prescribed appraisals or evaluations on loan extensions or renewals 
these violations of law were subsequently remedied 
of 
table of contents the june examination indicated that risk management practices needed improvement 
management information systems needed to be redesigned and implemented to more accurately measure fundamental exposures  such as the ongoing credit risk posed by the residential construction and land development loan portfolio and the emerging liquidity risks 
the bank needed to continue its efforts to address and reduce the increasing volume of problem assets 
while the loan grading process showed improvement over the prior several examinations  the alll methodology was identified as flawed in the june examination

net interest income has declined over the past two years  totaling million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decline in net interest income was primarily the result of declines in the volume of interest earning assets which more than outweighed the decrease in interest expense during average interest earning assets decreased approximately million between and as the size of the balance sheet was reduced in line with economic impact on the company s loan portfolio 
the decrease in average earning assets between and consisted of a decrease of million in loans and million in investment securities offset by increases of million in federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits in the federal reserve bank

the largest decreases are in real estate construction and development loans and commercial and industrial loans  as the company reduced exposure to real estate markets hardest hit from the downturn 
loans decreased million between december  and december  more specifically  real estate construction and development loans decreased million between december  and december   as real estate construction declined significantly in the san joaquin valley and california overall 
the company did not make material additions to the real estate construction and development loan portfolio over the past few years because of the depressed real estate markets  and has focused its attention on monitoring existing construction loans in the portfolio 
real estate construction and development loans amounted to and of the total loan portfolio at december  and additionally  commercial real estate loans a component of real estate mortgage loans amounted to and  of the total loan portfolio at december   and  respectively 
residential mortgage loans are not generally a large part of the company s loan portfolio  but some residential mortgage loans are made to facilitate take out loans for construction borrowers when they were not able to obtain permanent financing elsewhere 
these loans are generally year amortizing loans with maturities of between three and five years 
loan participations  both sold and purchased  have declined over the past two years as lending originations have slowed significantly and the loan participation market with it

during  the company s net interest margin fell from for the year ended december   to for the year ended december  with approximately of the loan portfolio in floating rate instruments at december   the effects of low market rates continue to keep loan yields compressed 
the company has successfully sought to mitigate the low interest rate environment with loan floors included in new and renewed loans over the past year 
loans yielded during the years ended december  and december  in addition  the company s yield on investment securities decreased from at december  to at december  the company s cost of funds has continued to decline over the past year and has mitigated much of the decrease in yields on earning assets 
the company s average cost of funds was for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  wholesale borrowing and brokered deposit rates have remained low since late  resulting in overnight and short term borrowing rates of less than during much of the past year 
the company benefited from the low interest rate environment  and continues to utilize short term borrowing lines through the federal home loan bank 
although the company does not intend to increase its current level of brokered deposits  and in fact as a result of the recent agreement with the federal reserve bank and order with the california department of financial institutions  will systematically reduce brokered deposit levels as they mature in the future  the million in brokered deposits at december  continues to provide the company with a low cost source of deposits 
the company will continue to utilize these funding sources when possible to maintain prudent liquidity levels  while seeking to increase core deposits when possible 
total noninterest income of million reported for the year ended december  increased  or as compared to the year ended december  noninterest income continues to be driven by customer service fees  which totaled million for the year ended december   representing a decrease of  or over the million in customer service fees reported for the year ended december  customer service fees represented and of total noninterest income for the years ended december  and  respectively

effective september  and beginning with the quarterly interest payment due october   the company deferred interest payments on the company s million of junior subordinated debentures relating to its trust preferred securities 
this was the result of regulatory restraints which have precluded the bank from paying dividends to the holding company 
the agreement with the federal reserve bank entered into during march specifically prohibits the company and the bank from making any payments on the junior subordinated debt without prior approval of the federal reserve bank 
the terms of the debentures and trust indentures allow for the company to defer interest payments for up to consecutive quarters without default or penalty 
during the period that the interest deferrals are elected  the company will continue to record interest expense associated with the debentures 
upon the expiration of the deferral period  all accrued and unpaid interest will be due and payable 
under the terms of the debenture  the company is precluded from paying cash dividends to shareholders or repurchasing its stock during the deferral period 
the company has not paid any cash dividends on its common stock since the second quarter of and does not expect to resume cash dividends on its common stock for the foreseeable future 
because the company has elected to defer the quarterly payments of interest on its junior subordinated debentures issued in connection with the trust preferred securities as discussed above  the company is prohibited under the subordinated debenture agreement from paying cash dividends on its common stock during the deferral period 
in addition  pursuant to the agreement entered into with the federal reserve bank during march of  the company and the bank are precluded from paying cash dividends without prior consent of the federal reserve bank 
on march   june   september   and december   the company s board of directors declared a one percent quarterly stock dividend on the company s outstanding common stock 
the company believes  given the current uncertainties in the economy and unprecedented declines in real estate valuations in our markets  it is prudent to retain capital in this environment  and better position the company for future growth opportunities 
based upon the number of outstanding common shares on the record date of april   july  october   and january   respectively  an additional    and  shares  respectively  were issued to shareholders 
for purposes of earnings per share calculations  the company s weighted average shares outstanding and potentially dilutive shares used in the computation of earnings per share have been restated after giving retroactive effect to the stock dividends to shareholders for all periods presented

offsetting these decreases was an increase of million in cash and cash equivalents 
during the second quarter of  the company completed the sale of two purchased real estate mortgage loan portfolios totaling million  recognizing a gain of  on the transaction 
the sale of the mortgage loan portfolios has provided additional liquidity 
decreases of million in fhlb term borrowings between december  and december  were offset by increases of million in net deposits 
increases of million in now and money market accounts during the year ended december  were offset by decreases of million in savings and money market accounts and million in time deposits as the company continued its efforts to reduce the level of brokered time deposits during average loans comprised approximately of overall average earning assets during the year ended december   as compared to of average earning assets for the year ended december nonperforming assets  which are primarily related to the real estate loan and property portfolio  remained high during the year ended december  as real estate markets continue to suffer from the mortgage crisis which began during mid nonaccrual loans totaling million at december   decreased million from the balance reported at december  in determining the adequacy of the underlying collateral related to these loans  management monitors trends within specific geographical areas  loan to value ratios  appraisals  and other credit issues related to the specific loans

as of march   the company conducted annual impairment testing on the largest component of its outstanding balance of goodwill  that of the campbell operating unit resulting from the legacy merger during february in part  as a result of continued declines in interest rates and other economic factors within the industry  we could not conclude at march  that there was not a possibility of goodwill impairment under the current economic conditions 
during the second quarter of  the company utilized an independent valuation service to determine the aggregate fair value of the individual assets  liabilities  and identifiable intangible assets of the campbell operating unit in question to determine if the goodwill related to that operating unit was impaired  and if so  how much the impairment was 
management  with the assistance of the independent third party  concluded that there was impairment of the goodwill related to the campbell operating unit  and as a result the company recognized an impairment loss of million or per share pre tax and after tax for the quarter ended june  and the year ended december  the company recognized an impairment loss of million or per share pre tax and after tax for the quarter ended june  and the year ended december  management continues to monitor economic conditions in the real estate market for signs of further deterioration or improvement which may impact the level of the allowance for loan losses required to cover identified losses in the loan portfolio 
as the real estate market declined through  and that accelerated throughout much of  the level of problem assets increased  and the estimated real estate values on many of those assets decreased resulting in increased charge offs or write downs of those assets 
greater focus has been placed on monitoring and reducing the level of problem assets  while working with borrowers to find more options  including loan restructures  to work through these difficult economic times 
as a result of these efforts  restructured loans increased from a single loan totaling  at december  to approximately loans totaling million at december  decreasing to loans totaling million at december   and then decreasing to loans totaling million at december  provisions made to the allowance for credit losses  totaled million during the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the provisions made to the allowance for credit losses  totaling  during the first quarter of  million during the second quarter of  million made during the third quarter of  and million made during the fourth quarter of  provided a level in the allowance for credit losses that is deemed adequate to cover inherent losses in the loan portfolio

deposits increased by million during the year ended december   with increases experienced in now  money market  and savings accounts  which were offset by decreases of million in time deposits during decreases in time deposits experienced during the year ended december  were primarily the result of decreases in brokered wholesale deposits  as the company continues to reduce its reliance on brokered deposits and other wholesale funding sources  while enhancing liquidity 
of 
table of contents brokered deposits have provided the company a relatively inexpensive funding source over the past several years totaling million or of total deposits at december   as compared to million or of total deposits at december  brokered deposits and other wholesale funding sources were used to some degree to fund loan growth in and  but the current state of the economy and the financial condition of the company have made it increasingly important to continue to develop core deposits and reduce the company s dependence on brokered and other wholesale funding sources  including lines of credit with the federal reserve bank and the fhlb 
the company increased its efforts early in to develop core deposit growth with employee training throughout the entire organization and a deposit gathering program that incented employees to bring in new deposits from our local market area and establish more extensive relationships with our customers 
the company continues its deposit gathering program and committed additional resources to its efforts during including two full time employees dedicated to business development 
as part of its liquidity position improvement plan resulting from the formal agreement with the federal reserve bank issued in march  the company will reduce its reliance on brokered deposits over the next two years to levels more comparable with peers  which is currently about of total deposits 
the company will seek to replace maturing brokered deposits with core deposits  but may also control loan growth to help achieve that objective 
while the company still has a higher percentage of brokered deposits than peers at december   efforts to restructure the balance sheet through reducing the level of total assets  and specifically real estate loans  are proving successful 
total wholesale borrowings and brokered deposits decreased an additional million during the year ended december  to a balance of million at december  during october  the company prepaid million in fhlb advances with an original maturity date of as part of its balance sheet management strategy 
although the company had no borrowings at december   the company will continue to utilize overnight borrowings and other term credit lines as deemed prudent

the san joaquin valley and other california markets continue to exhibit weak demand for construction lending and commercial lending from small and medium size businesses  as commercial and residential real estate markets declined during much of and  and continued to do so in although we saw some improvement later in  the past year has presented significant challenges for the banking industry with tightening credit markets  weakening real estate markets  and increased loan losses adversely affecting the banking industry and the company 
the company continually evaluates its strategic business plan as economic and market factors change in its market area 
balance sheet management  enhancing revenue sources  and maintaining market share will be of primary importance during and beyond 
the banking industry is currently experiencing continued pressure on net margins as well as asset quality resulting from conditions in the real estate market  and weak credit markets 
during march  the company and the bank entered into a regulatory agreement with the federal reserve bank which  among other things  requires improvements in the overall condition of the company and the bank 
as a result  market rates of interest  asset quality  as well as regulatory oversight will continue be an important factor in the company s ongoing strategic planning process 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and follow general practices within the industry in which it operates 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions  and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources  when available 
when third party information is not available  valuation adjustments are estimated using the company s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
of 
table of contents the most significant accounting policies followed by the company are presented in note to the company s consolidated financial statements included herein 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this financial review  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has identified the determination of the allowance for credit losses  other real estate owned through foreclosure  impairment of collateralized mortgage obligations and other investment securities  and fair value estimates on junior subordinated debt  valuation for deferred income taxes  and goodwill  to be accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments  and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheet 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for credit losses and a discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for credit losses is included in the asset quality and allowance for credit losses section of this financial review 
other real estate owned real estate properties acquired through  or in lieu of  loan foreclosure are to be sold and are initially recorded at fair value of the property  less estimated costs to sell 
the excess  if any  of the loan amount over the fair value of the collateral is charged to the allowance for credit losses 
the determination of fair value is generally based upon pre approved  external appraisals 
as real estate markets declined over the past three years and essentially became illiquid in many areas  management was required to use additional judgment in determining the factors associated with fair value of the real estate  including the term over which the properties could be disposed in an orderly liquidation 
this became necessary as many appraisals were based upon comparable sales which were deeply discounted forced liquidations or bulk sales caused by the severity of the housing crises 
subsequent declines in the fair value of other real estate owned  along with related revenue and expenses from operations  are charged to noninterest expense 
the fair market valuation of such properties is based upon estimates  and as such  is subject to change as circumstances in the company s market area  or general economic trends  change 
impairment of investment securities investment securities classified as available for sale afs are carried at fair value and the impact of changes in fair value are recorded on the company s consolidated balance sheet as an unrealized gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a separate component of shareholders equity 
securities classified as afs or held to maturity htm are subject to review to identify when a decline in value is other than temporary 
in april  the fasb updated the accounting standards for the recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments 
the standard amends existing guidance on other than temporary impairments for debt securities and requires that the credit portion of other than temporary impairments be recorded in earnings and the noncredit portion of losses be recorded in other comprehensive income loss when the entity does not intend to sell the security and it is more likely than not that the entity will not be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its cost basis 
the company adopted the standard during the first quarter of factors considered in determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary include whether the decline is substantial  the duration of the decline  the reasons for the decline in value  whether the decline is related to a credit event or to a change in interest rate  our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time that will allow for a recovery of value  and the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer 
at december   the company considered three of its investment securities other than temporarily impaired 
the three private label collateralized mortgage obligations residential mortgage obligations have an amortized cost of million and carrying value of million 
impairment analysis on these three residential mortgage obligations was performed utilizing the services of a third party investment broker specializing in private label cmo s  and was based upon estimated cash flows 
estimated cash flows were based upon assumptions of future prepayments and default rates  and thus may be subject to revision as events change in the future 
for the year ended december   the company recognized pre tax losses totaling  related to the credit portion of the other than temporary impairment in earnings 
the remaining million impairment on the three residential mortgage obligations is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income at december  of 
table of contents fair value effective january   the company adopted fair value option accounting standards choosing to apply the standards to its junior subordinated debt 
the company concurrently adopted the accounting standards related to fair value measurements 
the accounting standards related to fair value measurements defines how applicable assets and liabilities are to be valued  and requires expanded disclosures about financial instruments carried at fair value 
the fair value measurement accounting standard establishes a hierarchical disclosure framework associated with the level of pricing observability utilized in measuring financial instruments at fair value 
the degree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates to the level of pricing observability 
financial instruments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices generally will have a higher degree of pricing observability and a lesser degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value 
conversely  financial instruments infrequently traded or not quoted in an active market will generally have little or no pricing observability and a higher degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value 
pricing observability is impacted by a number of factors  including the type of financial instrument  whether the financial instrument is new to the market and not yet established and the characteristics specific to the transaction 
determining fair values under the accounting standards may include judgments related to measurement factors that may vary from actual transactions executed in the marketplace 
for the years ended december  and december   the company recorded fair value gains related to its junior subordinated debt totaling million and  respectively 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about financial instruments carried at fair value 
goodwill business combinations involving the company s acquisition of the equity interests or net assets of another enterprise or the assumption of net liabilities in an acquisition of branches constituting a business may give rise to goodwill 
the acquisition of taft national bank during april gave rise to goodwill totaling approximately million  and the acquisition of legacy bank during february resulted in goodwill of approximately million 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in transactions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the value of goodwill is ultimately derived from the company s ability to generate net earnings after the acquisition 
a decline in net earnings could be indicative of a decline in the fair value of goodwill and result in impairment 
for that reason  goodwill is assessed for impairment at a reporting unit level at least annually using an internal discounted cash flow model 
during the years ended december  and  the company recognized goodwill impairment of million  and million  respectively  on the goodwill associated with the legacy acquisition 
while the company believes all assumptions utilized in its assessment of goodwill for impairment are reasonable and appropriate  changes in earnings  the effective tax rate  historical earnings multiples and the cost of capital could all cause different results for the calculation of the present value of future cash flows 
income taxes deferred income taxes are provided for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the company s assets and liabilities 
deferred taxes are measured using current tax rates applied to such taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered 
if the company s future income is not sufficient to apply the deferred tax assets within the tax years to which they may be applied  the deferred tax asset may not be realized and the company s income will be reduced 
at december   the company had recorded a valuation allowance of million against its deferred tax assets 
on january   the company adopted the accounting standards related to uncertainty in income taxes 
the standard prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
under the accounting standards  an entity should recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position if it determines that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination 
the term more likely than not means a likelihood of more than percent 
in assessing whether the more likely than not criterion is met  the entity should assume that the tax position will be reviewed by the applicable taxing authority 
of 
table of contents the company reviewed its various tax positions  including its ongoing reit case with the california franchise tax board ftb  as of january  adoption date  and then again each subsequent quarter during in light of the adoption of the accounting standards related to uncertainty in income taxes 
the bank  with guidance from advisors believes the case related to consent dividends taken by the bank s reit during has merit with regard to points of law  and that the tax law at the time allowed for the deduction of the consent dividend 
however  the bank  with the concurrence of advisors  cannot conclude that it is more than likely as defined that the bank will prevail in its case with the ftb 
as a result of this determination  effective january   the company recorded a reduction of  to beginning retained earnings upon adoption of the accounting standards related to uncertainty in income taxes to recognize the potential tax liability under the guidelines of the interpretation 
the adjustment includes amounts for assessed taxes  penalties  and interest 
it is the company s policy to recognize interest and penalties under fin as a component of income tax expense 
at december   the accumulated unrecognized tax liability  including interest to date was  during  the company continued to record accrued interest on the unrecognized liability  and then in october  under the provisions of franchise tax board voluntary compliance initiative program vci  the company settled its case related to the reit consent dividend 
as a result  the company had no fin reserve as of december  pursuant to the accounting standards related to uncertainty in income taxes  the company will continue to re evaluate existing tax positions  as well as new positions as they arise 
if the company determines in the future that its tax positions are not more likely than not to be sustained as defined by taxing authorities  the company may need to recognize additional tax liabilities 
revenue recognition the company s primary sources of revenue are interest income from loans and investment securities 
interest income is generally recorded on an accrual basis  unless the collection of such income is not reasonably assured or cannot be reasonably estimated 
pursuant to accounting standards related to revenue recognition  nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans are recognized as a yield adjustment to the related loans by amortizing them into income over the term of the loan using a method which approximates the interest method 
other credit related fees  such as standby letter of credit fees  loan placement fees and annual credit card fees are recognized as noninterest income during the period the related service is performed 
for loans placed on nonaccrual status  the accrued and unpaid interest receivable may be reversed at management s discretion based upon management s assessment of collectibility  and interest is thereafter credited to principal to the extent necessary to eliminate doubt as to the collectibility of the net carrying amount of the loan

provision for credit losses provisions for credit losses and the amount added to the allowance for credit losses is determined on the basis of management s continuous credit review of the loan portfolio  consideration of past loan loss experience  current and future economic conditions  and other pertinent factors 
such factors consider the allowance for credit losses to be adequate when it covers estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio

of 
table of contents the allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level deemed appropriate by management to provide for known and inherent risks in existing loans and commitments to extend credit 
the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is based upon management s continuing assessment of various factors affecting the collectibility of loans and commitments to extend credit  including current economic conditions  past credit experience  collateral  and concentrations of credit 
there is no precise method of predicting specific losses or amounts which may ultimately be charged off on particular segments of the loan portfolio 
the collectibility of a loan is subjective to some degree  but must relate to the borrower s financial condition  cash flow  quality of the borrower s management expertise  collateral and guarantees  and the state of the local economy

the allowance for loan losses includes an asset specific component  as well as a general or formula based component 
the company segments the loan and lease portfolio into eleven segments  primarily by loan class and type  that have homogeneity and commonality of purpose and terms for analysis under the formula based component of the allowance 
those loans which are determined to be impaired under current accounting guidelines are not subject to the formula based reserve analysis  and evaluated individually for specific impairment under the asset specific component of the allowance 
the eleven segments of the company s loan portfolio are as follows subtotals are provided as needed to allow the reader to reconcile the amounts to the company s loan classification reported elsewhere in these financial statements of

loss factors are based on the company s historical loss experience and on the internal risk grade of those loans and  may be adjusted for significant factors that  in management s judgment  affect the collectibility of the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
factors that may affect collectibility of the loan portfolio include levels of  and trends in delinquencies and nonaccrual loans  trends in volumes and term of loans  effects of any changes in lending policies and procedures including those for underwriting  collection  charge off  and recovery  experience  ability  and depth of lending management and staff  national and local economic trends and conditions and  concentrations of credit that might affect loss experience across one or more components of the portfolio  including high balance loan concentrations and participations 
management determines the loss factors for problem graded loans substandard  doubtful  and loss  special mention loans  and pass graded loans  based on a loss migration model 
the migration analysis incorporates loan losses over the past twelve quarters three years and loss factors are adjusted to recognize and quantify the loss exposure from changes in market conditions and trends in the company s loan portfolio 
the twelfth quarter loss factor is compared to the th and th quarter loss factors and the average loss factor for the quarters 
the model may be more heavily weighted on the most current periods if those periods are more indicative of future trends because losses are accelerating in the shorter term 
based on an analysis of the information  current economic conditions and current and historical loss trends for the bank  the existing net loss factors  prior to qualitative adjustment  are adjusted to recognize and quantify the loss exposure from changes in loss histories and trends in the company s loan portfolio 
for purposes of this analysis  loans are grouped by internal risk classifications  which are pass  special mention  substandard  doubtful  and loss 
certain loans are homogenous in nature and are therefore pooled by risk grade 
these homogenous loans include consumer installment and home equity loans 
special mention loans are currently performing but are potentially weak  as the borrower has begun to exhibit deteriorating trends  which if not corrected  could jeopardize repayment of the loan and result in further downgrade 
substandard loans have well defined weaknesses which  if not corrected  could jeopardize the full satisfaction of the debt 
a loan classified as doubtful has critical weaknesses that make full collection of the obligation improbable 
classified loans  as defined by the company  include loans categorized as substandard  doubtful  and loss 
at december   problem graded or classified loans totaled million or of gross loans  as compared to million or of gross loans at december  of 
table of contents loan participations are reviewed for allowance adequacy under the same guidelines as other loans in the company s portfolio  with an additional participation factor added  if required  for specific risks associated with participations 
in general  participations are subject to certain thresholds set by the company  and are reviewed for geographic location as well as the well being of the underlying agent bank 
the formula allowance includes reserves for certain off balance sheet risks including letters of credit  unfunded loan commitments  and lines of credit 
reserves for undisbursed commitments are generally formula allocations based on the company s historical loss experience and other loss factors  rather than specific loss contingencies 
at december  and  the formula reserve allocated to undisbursed commitments totaled  and  respectively 
the reserve for unfunded commitments is considered a reserve for contingent liabilities and is therefore carried as a liability on the balance sheet for all periods presented 
specific allowances are established based on management s periodic evaluation of loss exposure inherent in impaired loans 
specific allowances are determined based on the collateralized value of the underlying properties  the net present value of the anticipated cash flows  or the market value of the underlying assets 
formula allowances for classified loans excluding impaired loans  specific allowances  where required  are determined on the basis of additional risks involved with individual loans that may be in excess of risk factors associated with the loan portfolio as a whole 
the specific allowance is different from the formula allowance in that the specific allowance is determined on a loan by loan basis based on risk factors directly related to a particular loan  as opposed to the formula allowance which is determined for a pool of loans with similar characteristics  based on past historical trends and other risk factors which may be relevant on an ongoing basis 
the unallocated portion of the allowance is the result of both expected and unanticipated changes in various conditions that are not directly measured in the determination of the formula and specific allowances 
the conditions may include  but are not limited to  general economic and business conditions affecting the key lending areas of the company  credit quality trends  collateral values  loan volumes and concentrations  and other business conditions

the level of pass loans decreased approximately million during the year ended december   and the related formula allowance decreased  for as a result of the volume decrease which more than offset increases in percentage loss allocations  as well as factor allocation increases due to current economic conditions 
the company s methodology includes features that are intended to reduce the difference between estimated and actual losses 
the specific allowance portion of the analysis is designed to be self correcting by taking into account the current loan loss experience based on that portion of the portfolio 
by analyzing the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio on a quarterly basis  management is able to adjust specific and inherent loss estimates using the most recent information available 
in performing the periodic migration analysis  management believes that historical loss factors used in the computation of the formula allowance need to be adjusted to reflect current changes in market conditions and trends in the company s loan portfolio 
there are a number of other factors  which are reviewed when determining adjustments in the historical loss factors 
they include trends in delinquent and nonaccrual loans  trends in loan volume and terms  effects of changes in lending policies  concentrations of credit  competition  national and local economic trends and conditions  experience of lending staff  loan review and board of directors oversight  high balance loan concentration  and other business conditions 
there were no changes in estimation methods or assumptions during that affected the methodology for assessing the overall adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
management and the company s lending officers evaluate the loss exposure of classified and impaired loans on a weekly and monthly basis  and through discussions and officer meetings as conditions change 
the company s loan committee meets weekly and serves as a forum to discuss specific problem assets that pose significant concerns to the company  and to keep the board of directors informed through committee minutes 
all special mention and classified loans are reported quarterly on criticized asset reports  which are reviewed by senior management 
with this information  the migration analysis and the impaired loan analysis are performed on a quarterly basis and adjustments are made to the allowance as deemed necessary 
as the real estate market and economic crisis became more severe beginning during the later part of  the company has successfully worked with many of its borrowers to re margin loans as collateral values declined  weakening the company s credit position and increasing the potential for losses 
this process of working with potentially troubled borrowers is monitored closely through the loan review process 
of 
table of contents the specific allowance for impaired loans is measured based on the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
the amount of impaired loans is not directly comparable to the amount of nonperforming loans disclosed later in this section 
the primary differences between impaired loans and nonperforming loans are i all loan categories are considered in determining nonperforming loans while impaired loan recognition is limited to commercial and industrial loans  commercial and residential real estate loans  construction loans  and agricultural loans  and ii impaired loan recognition considers not only loans days or more past due  restructured loans and nonaccrual loans but also may include problem loans other than delinquent loans 
the company considers a loan to be impaired when  based upon current information and events  it believes it is probable the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
impaired loans include nonaccrual loans  restructured debt  and performing loans in which full payment of principal or interest is not expected 
management bases the measurement of these impaired loans on the fair value of the loan s collateral or the expected cash flows on the loans discounted at the loan s stated interest rates 
cash receipts on impaired loans not performing to contractual terms and that are on nonaccrual status are used to reduce principal balances 
impairment losses are included in the allowance for credit losses through a charge to the provision  if applicable 
at december  and  the company s recorded investment in loans for which impairment has been recognized totaled million and million  respectively 
included in total impaired loans at december   are million of impaired loans for which the related specific allowance is million  as well as million of impaired loans that as a result of write downs or the fair value of the collateral  did not have a specific allowance 
total impaired loans at december  included million of impaired loans for which the related specific allowance is million  as well as million of impaired loans that as a result of write downs or the fair value of the collateral  did not have a specific allowance 
the average recorded investment in impaired loans was million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
in most cases  the company uses the cash basis method of income recognition for impaired loans 
in the case of certain troubled debt restructuring for which the loan is performing under the current contractual terms  income is recognized under the accrual method 
the largest category of impaired loans at december  were real estate mortgage and real estate construction and development loans  comprising of and almost of total impaired loans at december   respectively 
impaired construction loans decreased million  impaired commercial and industrial loans decreased million  and impaired agricultural loans decreased million during the year ended december  while impaired real estate mortgage loans increased million 
specific collateral related to impaired loans is reviewed for current appraisal information  economic trends within geographic markets  loan to value ratios  and other factors that may impact the value of the loan collateral 
adjustments are made to collateral values as needed for these factors

the company makes various types of concessions when structuring tdr s including rate reductions  payment extensions  and forbearance 
of 
table of contents at december   more than million of the total million in tdr s was for real estate construction and development  and million and million related to developers in commercial real estate and commercial and industrial  respectively at december  at december  and  the company held approximately million and million  respectively  in restructured residential mortgage loans of borrowers unable to secure take out financing at the end of their construction loan with the company 
in part to assist the borrowers to retain newly constructed homes under california senate bill sb  the company modified loans at market rates of interest with year amortization to mature in three to five year terms 
tdr s at december  as a percentage of the loan portfolio is similar to the percentage breakout of the million in tdr s reported at december   the majority of these credits are related to real estate construction projects that have slowed significantly or stalled  and the company pursued restructuring the qualified credits while the construction industry recovers and allow developers an opportunity to finish projects at a slower pace 
this reflects current market conditions in the san joaquin valley 
concessions granted in these circumstances include lengthened maturities  lower lot release prices  or rate reductions that enable the borrower to finish the construction projects and repay loans to the company 
the downturn in the real estate construction market is protracted  and although the company has had success in its restructuring efforts  not all restructured efforts will be entirely successful 
regions such as bakersfield california had been slower to recover than others in out market area but now show signs of leading the recovery compared with other southern san joaquin valley regions 
while recent data indicates real estate prices stabilized in  deterioration beyond current expectations may require additional resrves to lower asset values to allow borrowers to continue completing construction projects and selling units at lower prices

as of december   the company has no commercial real estate cre workouts whereby an existing loan was restructured into multiple new loans ie  a note b note structure 
for a restructured loan to return to accrual status there needs to be at least months successful payment history 
in addition  our credit administration performs a financial analysis of the credit to determine whether the borrower has the ability to continue to perform successfully over the remaining life of the loan 
this includes  but is not limited to  review of financial statements and cash flow analysis of the borrower 
only after determination that the borrower has the ability to perform under the terms of the loans  will the restructured credit be considered for accrual status 
the following table summarizes special mention loans by type for the year ended december  and december  in thousands december  december  commercial and industrial real estate mortgage commercial real estate residential mortgages home equity loans total real estate mortgage re construction development agricultural installment other lease financing total special mention loans the company focuses on competition and other economic conditions within its market area and other geographical areas in which it does business  which may ultimately affect the risk assessment of the portfolio 
the company continues to experience increased competition from major banks  local independents and non bank institutions creating pressure on loan pricing 
low interest rates and a weak economy continue to dominate  even though signs of real estate prices show signs of stabilization 
the company continues to place increased emphasis on reducing both the level of nonperforming assets and the level of losses on the disposition of these assets 
it is in the best interest of both the company and the borrowers to seek alternative options to foreclosure in an effort to reduce the impacts on the real estate market 
as part of this strategy  the company has increased its level of troubled debt restructurings  when it makes economic sense 
even though business and consumer spending show improvement in recent quarters current gdp remains anemic 
it is difficult to forecast the impact federal reserve actions to hold rates low will be on the economy 
the local market has remained relatively more stable economically during the past several years than some areas of the state and the nation  where more volatile economic impacts were experienced  including more severe deterioration of residential real estate markets 
although the local area residential housing markets have been hard hit  they continue to perform better than some parts of the state 
which bodes well for sustained  but slower growth in the company s market areas of fresno and madera  kern  and santa clara counties 
local unemployment rates in the san joaquin valley remain high compared with other regions but are historically high as a result of the areas agricultural dynamics the company believes that the central san joaquin valley will continue to grow and diversify as property and housing costs remain low relative to other areas of the state 
management recognizes increased risk of loss due to the company s exposure from local and worldwide economic conditions  as well as potentially volatile real estate markets  and takes these factors into consideration when analyzing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses

of 
table of contents management believes that the credit loss allowance to total loans at december  is adequate to absorb known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
no assurance can be given  however  that the economic conditions which may adversely affect the company s service areas or other circumstances will not be reflected in increased losses in the loan portfolio 
management is not currently aware of any conditions that may adversely affect the levels of losses incurred in the company s loan portfolio 
although the company does not normally allocate the allowance for credit losses to specific loan categories  an allocation to the major categories has been made for the purposes of this report as set forth in the following table 
the allocations are estimates based on the same factors as considered by management in determining the amount of additional provisions to the credit loss allowance and the overall adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
allowance allowance allowance allowance allowance for credit of for credit of for credit of for credit of for credit of dollars in thousands losses loans losses loans losses loans losses loans losses loans commercial and industrial real estate mortgage re construction and development agricultural installment other lease financing not allocated during  reserve allocations decreased in all categories during the year  except for a small increase in the reserve on installment loans 
during  reserve allocations increased in all categories except installment loans and lease financing loans  which decreased approximately  and  respectively  during the year 
increases in reserve allocations during are primarily the result of declining collateral values during the year 
during  reserve allocations increased for commercial and industrial loans  real estate mortgage loans  construction loans  and installment loans 
increased reserve allocations for commercial and industrial loans are the result of increased loan volume and increased loss factors applied to classified loan classifications  while increases in reserve allocations for real estate mortgage and installment loans are primarily the result of increases in substandard loans in those categories 
reserve allocations increased for real estate construction loans as a result of both an increase in the level of special mention loans in that category  as well as increased specific reserves on certain loans in that category between december  and december  the following summarizes the company s allowance for credit losses related to the specific  formula  and unallocated reserves for the year ends shown december  dollars in s formula allowance specific allowance unallocated allowance total allowance at december   the allowance for credit losses totaled million  and consisted of million in formula allowance  million in specific allowance  and  in unallocated allowance

the allowance for credit losses totaled million at december   and consisted of million in formula allowance  million in specific allowance  and  in unallocated reserve 
at december   million of the specific allowance was allocated to real estate construction loans  and the remaining million   and  were allocated to commercial and industrial loans  real estate commercial loans  and agricultural loans  respectively 
the total formula allowance increased approximately million between and  primarily due to increased reserve factors resulting from losses incurred during the year 
between december  and december   substandard loans decreased million  while special mention decreased million 
there were no loans classified as doubtful at december  or december  the total formula allowance decreased approximately million between and  primarily as the result of decreased volume in pass loans 
the formula allowance for commercial loans decreased million during  and decreased  for installment loans  with only minor changes in other loan categories 
between december  and december   substandard loans decreased million  while special mention and doubtful loans decreased million and million  respectively 
the total formula allowance increased approximately  between and  primarily as the result of increased loss factors applied to pass loans which more than outweighed the decline in volume of pass loans 
between december  and december   sub substandard loans decreased million  while special mention loans decreased million  but the specific reserve increased million during the period as a result of deterioration in the impaired loan portfolio 
although in some instances  the downgrading of a loan resulting from the factors used by the company in its allowance analysis has been reflected in the formula allowance  management believes that in some instances  the impact of material events and trends has not yet been reflected in the level of nonperforming loans or the internal risk grading process regarding these loans 
accordingly  the company s evaluation of probable losses related to these factors may be reflected in the unallocated allowance 
the evaluation of the inherent losses concerning these factors involves a higher degree of uncertainty because they are not identified with specific problem credits  and therefore the company does not spread the unallocated allowance among segments of the portfolio 
at december  and december   the company had an unallocated allowance of  and  while at december   the company had no unallocated allowance 
management s estimates of the unallocated allowance are based upon a number of underlying factors including the effect of deteriorating national and local economic trends  the effects of export market conditions on certain agricultural and manufacturing borrowers  the effects of abnormal weather patterns on agricultural borrowers  as well as other borrowers that may be impacted by such conditions  the effect of increased competition in the company s market area and the resultant potential impact of more relaxed underwriting standards to borrowers with multi bank relationships  the effect of soft real estate markets  and the effects of having a larger number of borrowing relationships which are close to the company s lending limit  any one if which were not to perform to contractual terms  would have a material impact on the allowance 
the company s loan portfolio has concentrations in commercial real estate  commercial  and construction loans  however the portfolio percentages fall within the company s loan policy guidelines 
it is the company s policy to discontinue the accrual of interest income on loans for which reasonable doubt exists with respect to the timely collectibility of interest or principal due to the inability of the borrower to comply with the terms of the loan agreement 
such loans are placed on nonaccrual status whenever the payment of principal or interest is days past due or earlier when the conditions warrant  and interest collected is thereafter credited to principal to the extent necessary to eliminate doubt as to the collectibility of the net carrying amount of the loan 
management may grant exceptions to this policy if the loans are well secured and in the process of collection

the company continues to move past due loans to nonaccrual status in its ongoing effort to recognize loan problems at an earlier point in time when they may be dealt with more effectively 
as impaired loans  nonaccrual and restructured loans are reviewed for specific reserve allocations and the allowance for credit losses is adjusted accordingly 
except for the loans included in the above table  there were no loans at december  where the known credit problems of a borrower caused the company to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrower to comply with the present loan repayment terms and which would result in such loan being included as a nonaccrual  past due or restructured loan at some future date 
liquidity and asset liability management the primary function of asset liability management is to provide adequate liquidity and maintain an appropriate balance between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities 
liquidity liquidity management may be described as the ability to maintain sufficient cash flows to fulfill both on and off balance sheet financial obligations  including loan funding commitments and customer deposit withdrawals  without straining the company s equity structure 
to maintain an adequate liquidity position  the company relies on  in addition to cash and cash equivalents  cash inflows from deposits and short term borrowings  repayments of principal on loans and investments  and interest income received 
the company s principal cash outflows are for loan origination  purchases of investment securities  depositor withdrawals and payment of operating expenses 
other sources of liquidity not on the balance sheet at december  include unused collateralized and uncollateralized lines of credit from other banks  the federal home loan bank  and from the federal reserve bank totaling million 
cash and cash equivalents have fluctuated during the three years ended december    and  with period end balances as follows from consolidated statements of cash flows in s balance december  december  december  cash and cash equivalents increased million during the year ended december  as compared to an increase of million during the year ended december  the company has maintained positive cash flows from operations over the past two years  which amounted to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company experienced net cash inflows from investing activities totaling and million during the years ended december  and  respectively through decreases in loans  sales of oreo properties  and maturities of investment securities 
net cash flows from financing activities  including deposit growth and borrowings  have traditionally provided funding sources for loan growth  but during and the company experienced net cash outflows totaling million and million  respectively 
the cash outflows during and were the result of planned reductions in outstanding borrowings and brokered deposits which exceeded increases in demand deposits and savings accounts 
of 
table of contents liquidity risk arises from the possibility the company may not be able to satisfy current or future financial commitments  or the company may become unduly reliant on alternative funding sources 
the company maintains a liquidity risk management policy to address and manage this risk 
the policy identifies the primary sources of liquidity  sets wholesale funding limits  establishes procedures for monitoring and measuring liquidity  and establishes minimum liquidity requirements  which comply with regulatory guidance 
the liquidity position is continually monitored and reported on a monthly basis to the board of directors 
the policy also includes a contingency funding plan to address liquidity needs in the event of an institution specific or a systemic financial market crisis 
in addition to unused lines of credit from other banks totaling million  the contingency plan includes identified funding sources  and steps that may be taken in the event the total liquidity ratio falls or is projected to fall below policy limits for any extended period of time 
one of the primary directives of the contingency funding plan is to limit the company s overall level of wholesale funding to no more than of deposits 
the current funding program uses both asset based and liability based principles  and identifies core deposits as the favored funding source when attainable at a reasonable cost 
the policy identifies a number of funding sources or methods the bank alco committee may utilize to fulfill the company s liquidity funding requirements local core deposits are the company s primary funding source 
the company must expand its efforts to attract these deposits through service related and competitive pricing tactics 
other liquidity funding sources should only be consider of local core deposits are not attractive because of maturity or pricing 
unsecured federal funds lines with correspondent banks may be used to fund short term peaks in loan demand or deposit run off 
currently  unsecured borrowing lines with correspondents are limited and may not be reliable for long periods of time or in times of economic stress 
other funding sources such as secured credit lines with the federal home loan bank or the federal reserve may be used for longer periods 
the company collateralizes these available lines with a combination of investment securities and pledged loans 
the company has utilized specific loan pledging with both the fhlb and the federal reserve to better ensure the continued availability of those lines of credit 
the company presently has a discount window facility available from the federal reserve bank of san francisco collateralized with loans as discussed above 
at december  the company had available credit of million from the federal reserve based upon the loans pledged at that date 
the federal reserve will monitor use of the discount window closely given the current status of the company and the economy as a whole and 
in addition  this credit facility may not be competitively priced under normal economic conditions 
as such  the company does not expect to use this facility except in times of crises  but does consider this to be a key contingency funding source 
as long as the bank remains well capitalized the company may rely on brokered deposits when core deposit rates are higher in the marketplace or maturity structures are not desirable 
the company s current policy limit for brokered deposits is of total deposits 
the company may also utilize other wholesale deposit sources such as memberships that advertise the bank s time deposit rates to other subscribers  typically banks and credit unions 
the company s current policy limit on other wholesale deposits is of total deposits 
the bank may sell whole loans or participations in loans to provide additional liquidity 
during economic downturns or other crises events  these funding sources may be difficult to achieve in a short period of time or at a reasonable price 
as such  this strategy is better used as a long term asset liability management tool to effectively balance assets and liabilities to reduce liquidity risk 
the company currently has bank owned life insurance boli policies issued by highly rated insurance companies which may be sold to increase liquidity 
the company owns certain real estate including its administration building and several of its branches 
these may be sold and vacated or leased back from the purchaser after sale to provide additional liquidity if needed 
the sales process may require substantial time to complete  and may have an adverse impact on earnings depending on market rates and other factors at the time of sale 
investments near maturity may be sold to meet temporary funding needs but may need to be replaced to maintain liquidity ratios within acceptable limits 
at the current time much of the investment portfolio is pledged to secure public deposits and borrowing lines 
as wholesale funding dependence is reduced  the available liquidity in the investment portfolio will increase 
the company seeks to maintain an investment grade securities portfolio to ensure quality collateral for pledging against borrowing lines of credit as well as to provide liquidity in times of needs

table of contents the company continues to utilize liability management  when needed  as part of its overall asset liability management strategy 
through the discretionary acquisition of short term borrowings  the company has been able to provide liquidity to fund asset growth while  at the same time  better utilizing its capital resources  and better controlling interest rate risk 
the borrowings are generally short term and more closely match the repricing characteristics of floating rate loans  which comprise approximately of the company s loan portfolio at december  this does not preclude the company from selling assets such as investment securities to fund liquidity needs but  with favorable borrowing rates  the company has maintained a positive yield spread between borrowed liabilities and the assets which those liabilities fund 
if  at some time  rate spreads become unfavorable  the company has the ability to utilize an asset management approach and  either control asset growth or  fund further growth with maturities or sales of investment securities 
the company s liquid asset base which generally consists of cash and due from banks  federal funds sold  securities purchased under agreements to resell reverse repos and investment securities  is maintained at a level deemed sufficient to provide the cash outlay necessary to fund loan growth as well as any customer deposit runoff that may occur 
within this framework is the objective of maximizing the yield on earning assets 
this is generally achieved by maintaining a high percentage of earning assets in loans  which historically have represented the company s highest yielding asset 
at december   the bank had of total assets in the loan portfolio and a loan to deposit ratio of 
liquid assets at december  include cash and cash equivalents totaling million as compared to million at december  liabilities used to fund liquidity sources include core and non core deposits as well as short term borrowings 
core deposits  which comprise approximately of total deposits at december   provide a significant and stable funding source for the company 
at december   unused lines of credit with the federal home loan bank and the federal reserve bank totaling million are collateralized in part by certain qualifying loans in the company s loan portfolio 
the carrying value of loans pledged on these used and unused borrowing lines totaled million at december  for further discussion of the company s borrowing lines  see short term borrowings included previously in the financial condition section of this financial review 
the federal reserve board has notified the bank that it will permit the bank to draw on its line of credit with the federal reserve bank only in limited circumstances and for a short duration 
the liquidity of the parent company  united security bancshares  is primarily dependent on the payment of cash dividends by its subsidiary  united security bank  subject to limitations imposed by the financial code of the state of california 
the bank currently has limited ability to pay dividends or make capital distributions see regulatory agreement section included in regulatory matters of this management s discussion 
the limited ability of the bank to pay dividends may impact the ability of the company to fund its ongoing liquidity requirements including ongoing operating expenses  as well as quarterly interest payments on the company s junior subordinated debt trust preferred securities 
under an agreement with the federal reserve dated march   the bank is precluded from paying a cash dividend to the company 
to conserve cash and capital resources  the company elected at september  to defer the payment of interest on its junior subordinated debt beginning with the quarterly payment due october  the company has not determined how long it will defer interest payments  but under the terms of the debenture  interest payments may be deferred up to five years quarters 
during such deferral periods  the company is prohibited from paying dividends on its common stock subject to certain exceptions and will continue to accrue interest payable on the junior subordinated debt 
the bank paid no dividends to the parent company during the years ended december  and during the year ended december   cash dividends paid by the bank to the parent company totaled  regulatory matters regulatory agreement regulatory agreement with the federal reserve bank of san francisco effective march   united security bancshares the company and its wholly owned subsidiary  united security bank the bank  entered into a written agreement the agreement with the federal reserve bank of san francisco 
under the terms of the agreement  the company and the bank agreed  among other things  to strengthen board oversight of management and the bank s operations  submit an enhanced written plan to strengthen credit risk management practices and improve the bank s position on the past due loans  classified loans  and other real estate owned  maintain a sound process for determining  documenting  and recording an adequate allowance for loan and lease losses  improve the management of the bank s liquidity position and funds management policies  maintain sufficient capital at the company and bank level  and improve the bank s earnings and overall condition 
the company and bank have also agreed not to increase or guarantee any debt  purchase or redeem any shares of stock  declare or pay any cash dividends  or pay interest on the company s junior subordinated debt or trust preferred securities  without prior written approval from the federal reserve bank 
the company generates no revenue of its own and as such  relies on dividends from the bank to pay its operating expenses and interest payments on the company s junior subordinated debt 
the inability of the bank to pay cash dividends to the company may hinder the company s ability to meet its ongoing operating obligations

the agreement was the result of significant increases in nonperforming assets  both classified loans and oreo  during and increasing the overall risk profile of the bank
