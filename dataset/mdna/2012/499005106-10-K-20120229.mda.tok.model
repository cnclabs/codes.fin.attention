table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview we are a global financial services firm that provides access to the capital markets across multiple asset classes to a broad network of clients  including buy and sell side firms and corporations 
we seek to continually apply our expertise and innovation to the trade execution process to build lasting client relationships through consistent performance and superior client service 
we also provide capital markets services to corporate issuers and private companies 
in the third quarter of  we changed from three operating segments i equities  ii fixed income  currencies and commodities and iii corporate to four operating segments i market making  ii institutional sales and trading  iii electronic execution services and iv corporate and other 
this change was made to better reflect the current nature of the company s offerings and services  its distribution methods and how we manage our businesses 
market making our market making segment principally consists of market making in global equities and listed domestic options 
as a market maker  we commit capital for trade executions by offering to buy securities from  or sell securities to  institutions and broker dealers 
our market making segment primarily includes client  and to a lesser extent  non client electronic market making activities in which we operate as a market maker in equity securities quoted and traded on the nasdaq stock market  the over the counter otc market for new york stock exchange nyse  nyse amex equities nyse amex  nyse arca listed securities and several european exchanges 
as a complement to electronic market making  our cash trading business handles specialized orders and also transacts on the otc bulletin board and the otc pink markets 
we provide trade executions as an equities designated market maker dmm on the nyse and nyse amex 
market making also includes our option market making business which has expanded trading onto several electronic exchanges 
institutional sales and trading our institutional sales and trading segment includes global equity and fixed income sales  reverse mortgage origination and securitization  capital markets and asset management activities 
the primary business of the institutional sales and trading segment is to execute and facilitate equities and fixed income transactions as agent on behalf of institutional clients  and we commit capital on behalf of our clients when needed 
this is predominantly a full service execution business  in which much of the interaction is based on the company s client relationships 
this segment also facilitates client orders through program and block trades and riskless principal trades and provides capital markets services  including equity and debt private placement 
electronic execution services our electronic execution services segment offers access to markets and self directed trading via our electronic agency based platforms 
in contrast to market making  we generally do not act as a principal to transactions that are executed within this segment and generally earn commissions for acting as agent between the principals to the trade 
corporate and other our corporate and other segment invests in strategic financial services oriented opportunities  allocates  deploys and monitors all capital  and maintains corporate overhead expenses and all other income and expenses that are not attributable to the other segments 
the corporate and other segment houses functions that support our other segments such as self clearing services  including stock lending activities

included in expenses for the year ended december  is a restructuring charge of million which includes million for market making  million for institutional sales and trading  million for electronic execution services  and million for corporate and other 
consolidated revenues in increased million  or from  while consolidated expenses increased million or from consolidated pre tax earnings from continuing operations in increased million  or from the changes in our pre tax earnings loss from continuing operations by segment from to are summarized as follows market making our pre tax earnings from market making increased in by million  or  from the increase is primarily due to better performance and expansion of our client and non client trading models and higher volumes and volatility offset  in part  by higher expenses including investments in europe and options market making  increased volume based transaction fees and higher payments for order flow 
institutional sales and trading our pre tax loss from institutional sales and trading increased in by million from the decline in performance is primarily due to a 
table of contents slowdown in our institutional equities and fixed income businesses  tighter spreads  higher compensation costs  including those related to changes in management as well as higher fixed compensation costs  and a higher restructuring charge in offset  in part  by greater contributions from listed derivatives  urban  and our capital markets businesses 
electronic execution services our pre tax earnings from electronic execution services increased in by million  or  from the increase is primarily due to higher volumes and earnings due to the growth and scalability of our platforms 
corporate and other our pre tax loss from our corporate and other segment decreased in by million from  primarily due to lower losses from our strategic investments and higher interest income from our stock borrow activity offset  in part  by higher interest expense incurred from our long term debt and stock loan activity as well as incremental restructuring charges in the third quarter of certain factors affecting results of operations we may experience significant variation in our future results of operations 
these fluctuations may result from numerous factors  including  among other things  market conditions and the resulting volatility and credit and counterparty risks that may result  introductions of  or enhancements to  trade execution services by us or our competitors  the value of our securities positions and other financial instruments and our ability to manage the risks attendant thereto  the volume of our trade execution activities  the dollar value of securities and other instruments traded  the composition and profile of our order flow  our market share with institutional and broker dealer clients  the performance and size of  and volatility in  our client market making and program trading portfolios  the performance of our non client principal trading activities  movements of credit spreads  hecm origination and hmbs securitization volumes  the overall size of our balance sheet and capital usage  the performance of our global operations  costs associated with overall business growth  the effectiveness of our self clearing platform and our ability to manage risk related thereto  the availability of credit and liquidity in the marketplace  our ability to manage personnel  compensation  overhead and other expenses  including our occupancy expenses under our office leases and expenses and charges relating to legal and regulatory proceedings  the strength of our client relationships  changes in payments for order flow  changes to execution quality and changes in clearing  execution and regulatory transaction costs  interest rate movements  the addition or loss of executive management  sales  trading and technology professionals  legislative  legal  regulatory and financial reporting changes  legal  regulatory matters or proceedings  geopolitical risk  the amount  timing and cost of capital expenditures  acquisitions and divestitures  the integration  performance and operation of acquired businesses  the incurrence of costs associated with acquisitions and dispositions  investor sentiment  technological changes and events  seasonality  competition  and other economic conditions 
such factors may also have an impact on our ability to achieve our strategic objectives  including  without limitation  increases in market share  growth and profitability in our four operating segments 
if demand for our services declines or our performance deteriorates significantly due to any of the above factors  and we are unable to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis  our operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
as a result of the foregoing factors  period to period comparisons of our revenues and operating results are not necessarily meaningful and such comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
there also can be no assurance that we will be able to continue the rates of revenue growth that we have experienced in the past or that we will be able to improve our operating results 

table of contents trends global economic trends our businesses are affected by many factors in the global financial markets and worldwide economic conditions 
these factors include the growth level of gross domestic product in the us  europe and asia  and the existence of transparent  efficient and liquid equity and debt markets and the level of trading volumes and volatility in such markets 
during the year ended december   there were several factors concerning investors  overall concern of the us and global economy  the u 
s deficit negotiations and standard and poor s downgrade of the us long term credit rating and the sovereign debt crisis within europe 
these factors resulted in increased volatility levels across equity markets as compared to the previous year  while in the debt markets  credit spreads tightened 
overall  there are still concerns about global stability and growth  inflation and declining asset values 
trends affecting our company we believe that our businesses are affected by the aforementioned global economic trends as well as more specific trends 
some of the specific trends that impact our operations  financial condition and results of operations are clients continue to focus on statistics measuring the quality of equity executions including speed of execution and price improvement 
in an effort to improve the quality of their executions as well as increase efficiencies  market makers have increased the level of automation within their operations and the extent of price improvement 
the greater focus on execution quality has resulted in greater competition in the marketplace  which  along with market structure changes and market conditions  has negatively impacted the revenue capture and margin metrics of the company and other market making firms 
market making  institutional sales and trading and electronic execution services transaction volumes executed by clients have fluctuated over the past few years due to retail and institutional investor sentiment  market conditions and a variety of other factors 
market making  institutional sales and trading and electronic execution services transaction volumes may not be sustainable and are not predictable 
over the past several years several exchanges have consolidated  and market participants have created alternative trading systems ats  ecn and other execution venues which compete within the otc and listed trading venues 
in addition  there are many new entrants into the market  including ats  multilateral trading facilities  systematic internalizers  dark liquidity pools  high frequency trading firms  and market making firms competing for retail and institutional order flow 
further  many broker dealers are offering their own internal crossing networks 
these factors continue to create further fragmentation and competition in the marketplace 
over the past few years  market structure changes  competition  market conditions and a steady increase in electronic trading have resulted in a reduction in institutional commission rates and volumes which may continue in the future 
additionally  many institutional clients allocate commissions to broker dealers based not only on the quality of executions  but also in exchange for research  or soft dollar and commission recapture programs 
there continues to be growth in electronic trading  as evidenced by increased volumes over the past few years in direct market access platforms  algorithmic and program trading  high frequency trading and ecns and dark liquidity pools 
in addition  electronic trading continues to expand to other asset classes  including options  currencies and fixed income 
the expansion of electronic trading may result in the growth of innovative electronic products and competition for order flow and may further reduce demand for traditional institutional voice services 

table of contents market structure changes  competition and technology advancements have also led to a dramatic increase in electronic message traffic 
these increases in message traffic place heavy strains on the technology resources  bandwidth and capacities of market participants 
there has been continued scrutiny of the capital markets industry by the regulatory and legislative authorities  both in the us and abroad 
new legislation or new or modified regulations and rules could occur in the future 
members of the us congress have raised various concerns about the regulatory structure of the us financial markets and have asked the sec and other regulators to take a close look at the regulatory structure and make the changes necessary to insure the rule framework governing the us financial markets is comprehensive and complete 
the sec and other regulators have stated that they will propose and adopt rules where necessary  on a variety of marketplace issues including  but not limited to high frequency trading  indications of interest  off exchange trading  dark liquidity pools  internalization  post trade attribution  co location  sponsored access  short sales  consolidated audit trails and market volatility rules including  circuit breakers and limit up  limit down rules 
in addition  the sec is considering proposals relating to self funding  and we expect increases  possibly substantial  in section fees 
on july   the dodd frank act was enacted into law marking a significant change to the regulation of the financial services industry 
this legislation affects nearly all financial institutions that operate in the us while the weight of the dodd frank act falls more heavily on large  complex financial institutions  smaller institutions will also face a more complicated and expensive regulatory framework 
reverse mortgages can be a cost effective way to help seniors age and older meet their financial needs in retirement  by enabling them to tap the equity in their home 
reverse mortgages are increasing in popularity with seniors who have equity in their homes and want to supplement their income and enhance their liquidity 
this trend may continue as the baby boomer generation enters retirement age 
however  there is no guarantee that this trend  current volumes  or the referenced popularity will continue 
in  the two largest reverse mortgage originators exited the reverse mortgage business 
declining home values and the inability to assess borrowers financial health were cited as factors contributing to their respective decisions 
in january  the us department of housing and urban development hud provided loss mitigation guidance for the resolution of hecms that are delinquent due to  among other things  unpaid property charges 
hud also discussed what steps lenders could take to get mortgagors back on track eg  establishing a repayment plan 
hud noted that foreclosure is and must remain a method of last resort for the resolution of unpaid property charges 
it has also been reported that hud is developing procedures that would allow lenders to assess a prospective borrower s income and expenses  and possibly require homeowners to set aside money to pay for taxes and insurance 
however  no formal guidelines have yet been published
