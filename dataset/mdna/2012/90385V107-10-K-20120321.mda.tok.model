overview we are a leading developer and supplier of critical subsystems  primarily for the semiconductor capital equipment industry 
we also leverage the specialized skill sets required to support semiconductor capital equipment to serve the technologically similar markets in the flat panel  medical  energy and research industries  collectively referred to as other addressed industries 
we develop  design  prototype  engineer  manufacture and test subsystems which are highly specialized and tailored to specific steps in the semiconductor manufacturing process as well as the manufacturing process in other addressed industries 
our revenue is derived primarily from the sale of gas delivery systems and other critical subsystems including chemical mechanical planarization cmp subsystems  chemical delivery modules  top plate assemblies  frame assemblies  process modules and other high level assemblies 
the results of our operations are largely dependent on the demand for semiconductors  which is ultimately driven by demand for electronic products 
these demands can vary depending on cyclical conditions of the industries we serve as well as global economic conditions 
for example  our financial results for fiscal years and reflect significantly increased demand for our products over fiscal  a year when demand for critical subsystems for the semiconductor capital equipment industry as well as other addressed industries was significantly reduced due to extremely unfavorable global economic conditions 
we also serve a relatively limited number of customers  especially in the semiconductor capital equipment business  as it is characterized by a limited number of large participants 
as a result our revenue is highly concentrated 
financial results for fiscal over fiscal reflected a modest increase in demand for our products  as our sales were million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year we did experience a slight downturn in our business during the second half of fiscal  primarily in the semiconductor capital equipment and energy industries  however  we do not expect this downturn to continue into fiscal our three largest customers in fiscal were applied materials  inc  lam research corporation and fei company  two of which each accounted for or more of our sales for fiscal year these customers  as a group  accounted for of our sales for fiscal two of our largest semiconductor customers  novellus systems and lam research  recently announced that they had entered into a merger agreement pursuant to which they would combine businesses 
also  in november  applied materials  inc completed the acquisition of varian semiconductor equipment associates  inc  one of our customers 
we will continue to assess the potential impact on our future operating results  however  at this time we do not believe either of these two mergers will have a significant impact  if any  on our business going forward 
in addition  we will be terminating our agreement for manufacturing services to fei company in april as fei has chosen to insource their production  however  we will continue to provide services for pay to fei for up to six months subsequent to termination of the agreement 
we do not believe the loss of fei will have a material effect on our fiscal operating results 
financial results for fiscal over fiscal reflected a significant increase in demand for our products in all industries that we serve as our operations began to recover from the global economic downturn of and our sales for fiscal increased million over fiscal with net income of million compared to a net loss of million in fiscal our three largest customers in fiscal year were applied materials  inc  lam research corporation and novellus systems  inc  two of which each accounted for or more of sales in fiscal year  and as a group  these customers accounted for of our sales 

table of contents financial results for fiscal reflected significantly reduced demand for our products in all industries in which we serve due to the extremely unfavorable global economic and industry conditions which began in fiscal sales were million 
our three largest customers in fiscal year were applied materials  inc  intuitive surgical  inc  and lam research corporation  each of which accounted for more than of our total sales in fiscal year  and as a group  these customers accounted for of our sales 
results of operations the following table sets forth income statement data for the periods indicated as a percentage of revenue year ended december  december  january  sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses income loss from operations interest and other income expense  net income loss before provision benefit for income taxes income tax provision benefit net income loss fiscal year compared with fiscal year sales sales for fiscal year increased million  or  to million from million for fiscal year substantially all of the revenue increase for the year is attributable to volume increases with existing customers at relatively constant prices 
during the final two quarters of fiscal year  however  we experienced a slowdown in demand  primarily in the semiconductor equipment and energy spaces 
gross profit cost of goods sold consists primarily of purchased materials  inventory write downs  and labor and overhead  including depreciation  associated with the design and manufacture of products sold 
gross profit for fiscal year increased slightly to million  or of sales  from million  or of sales  for fiscal year our gross margin for fiscal year decreased from fiscal year primarily as a result of relatively fixed overhead costs that did not decline proportionately to the decline in revenue experienced in the second half of fiscal year research and development expense research and development expense consists primarily of activities related to new component testing and evaluation  test equipment and fixture development  product design  and other product development activities 
research and development expense for fiscal year was million  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales for fiscal year the increase in year over year expense is due to an increase in payroll and related costs 

table of contents sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries and commissions paid to our sales and service employees  salaries paid to our engineers who work with the sales and service employees to help determine the components and configuration requirements for new products and other costs related to the sales of our products 
sales and marketing expense for fiscal year increased million to million  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales  for fiscal year the increase in year over year expense is primarily due to slight increases in payroll and related benefit costs as well as increased commissions due to increased revenue 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and overhead associated with our administrative staff and professional fees 
general and administrative expense for fiscal year increased approximately million  or to million  or of sales  compared with million  or of sales  for fiscal year the increase in dollars when comparing fiscal year with fiscal year is due primarily to an increase in payroll and related benefit costs associated with an increase in headcount for our singapore office 
the increase in general and administrative expense as a percent of sales for fiscal year  compared to fiscal year is due primarily to our investment in personnel in singapore  which resulted in general and administrative related personnel costs for fiscal year being a greater proportion of sales than in the prior year 
interest and other income expense  net interest and other income expense  net for fiscal year was million compared to million for fiscal year the increase in expense for fiscal year is primarily attributable to an increase in interest expense associated with an million term loan we entered into in october income tax provision our effective tax rate for fiscal year was a benefit of compared to a provision of for fiscal year the change in respective rates reflects  primarily  changes in our deferred tax assets and our accrual for uncertain tax positions  as well as a change in the geographic mix of worldwide earnings and financial results for the for fiscal year compared to fiscal year our effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate for fiscal year primarily due to the favorable impacts of the release of a valuation allowance  discussed in further detail below  as well as to the geographic distribution of our world wide earnings in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates 
as of december   we maintained a full valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets of one of our china subsidiaries 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal we reversed all of the valuation allowance related to our us subsidiaries 
in order to reverse a valuation allowance  sec guidance requires us to review our cumulative twelve quarter income loss as well as our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize our net deferred tax assets 
during fiscal  we conducted quarterly reviews of each of our subsidiaries 
our us subsidiaries reflected a cumulative twelve quarter profit at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to a cumulative twelve quarter loss at the end of the previous quarter  and based on financial trends of our us subsidiaries at the close of fiscal we determined with a higher level of confidence that we would generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets 
therefore  we concluded that it was appropriate to release all of the valuation allowance remaining after adjustment for true ups and changes in deferred tax assets  or million  related to our us subsidiaries 
we also concluded that due to a fourth quarter net loss and financial trends of one of our chinese subsidiaries  it was appropriate to increase the valuation allowance  to  thereby maintaining a full reserve on the deferred tax assets of that subsidiary 
during fiscal we also released million of valuation allowance due to true ups and changes in deferred tax assets for which we maintained a full valuation allowance 
the total valuation allowance on our consolidated deferred tax assets as of december   was  
table of contents our ability to realize deferred tax assets depends on its ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the same character within the carryback or carry forward periods 
in assessing future gaap taxable income  we have considered all sources of taxable income available to realize its deferred tax assets including the future reversal of existing temporary differences  future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carry forwards  taxable income in carryback years and tax planning strategies 
if changes occur in the assumptions underlying our tax planning strategies or in the scheduling of the reversal of our deferred tax liabilities  the valuation allowance may need to be adjusted in the future 
year ended december  compared with year ended january  sales sales for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended january  the increase in sales for reflects a recovery of semiconductor equipment demand since the overall slowdown in the industry 
substantially all of the revenue increase was attributable to volume increases with existing customers 
gross profit gross profit for the year ended december  increased to million  or of sales  from million  or of sales  for the year ended january  our gross margin for increased from primarily as a result of increased unit volume manufactured due to increased sales for fiscal and greater factory utilization 
our gross margin for reflected low unit volume manufactured due to decreased sales during fiscal  lower factory utilization and employee severance charges resulting from a series of reductions in force 
research and development expense research and development expense increased to million  or of sales  for the year ended december  compared to million  or of sales for the year ended january  the increase in expense is primarily a result of higher payroll and related benefit costs as a result of headcount increases 
sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expense was million and million for the years ended december  and january   respectively 
the increase in spending was due primarily to increased headcount related expenses and higher sales commissions 
as a percentage of sales  sales and marketing expense decreased to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended january  due to the substantially higher revenue base in compared to general and administrative expense general and administrative expense increased to million  or of sales  for the year ended december   from million  or of sales  for the year ended january  the increase in expense is due to primarily to increased payroll and related benefit costs as a result of increases in headcount and terminations costs for executives  partially offset by reductions in fees for outside professional services 
interest and other income expense  net interest and other income expense  net for fiscal year was million compared to million for fiscal components of interest and other income expense  net related primarily to interest expense for both fiscal and interest expense for was approximately million compared to million for and was slightly higher due to the million term loan entered into in the fourth quarter of offsetting interest expense was miscellaneous income including gains on sales of assets 

table of contents income tax provision our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended january  our effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate for the year ended december  primarily due to the geographic distribution of our world wide earnings  the favorable impacts of a reversal of million of previously established tax liability related to our uncertain tax positions and a partial release of million of valuation allowance 
critical accounting policies  significant judgments and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosure at the date of our consolidated financial statements 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to sales  inventories  intangible assets  stock compensation and income taxes 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis of our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  inventory valuation  accounting for income taxes  business combinations  valuation of intangible assets and goodwill  and equity incentives to employees to be critical policies due to the estimates and judgments involved in each 
revenue recognition our revenue for fiscal years  and was highly concentrated in four oem customers in the semiconductor capital equipment  energy  flat panel and medical industries 
our standard arrangement for our customers includes a signed purchase order or contract  no right of return of delivered products and no customer acceptance provisions 
revenue from sales of products is recognized when we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer  we ship the products  customer payment is deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties  and collection is reasonably assured 
revenue is generally recognized upon shipment of the product 
in arrangements which specify title transfer upon delivery  revenue is not recognized until the product is delivered 
in addition  if we have not fulfilled the terms of the agreement at the time of shipment  revenue recognition is deferred until fulfillment 
we assess collectability based on the creditworthiness of the customer and past transaction history 
we perform on going credit evaluations of  and do not require collateral from  our customers 
we have not experienced significant collection losses in the past 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one customer could make it more difficult for us to assess collectability 
inventory valuation we write down the carrying value of our inventory to net realizable value for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
we assess the valuation of all inventories  including raw materials  work in process  finished goods and spare parts on a periodic basis 
obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of our estimated usage is written down to its estimated market value 
table of contents less costs to sell  if less than its cost 
the inventory write downs are recorded as an inventory valuation allowance established on the basis of obsolete inventory or specific identified inventory in excess of established usage 
inherent in our estimates of demand and market value in determining inventory valuation are estimates related to economic trends  future demand for our products and technological obsolescence of our products 
if actual demand and market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write downs may be required 
if the inventory value is written down to its net realizable value  and subsequently there is an increased demand for the inventory at a higher value  the increased value of the inventory is not realized until the inventory is sold either as a component of a subsystem or as separate inventory 
for fiscal years and  respectively  we wrote down million and million in inventory determined to be obsolete 
accounting for income taxes the determination of our tax provision is subject to judgments and estimates 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets  which consist primarily of tax deductions  assumes we will be able to generate sufficient future income to fully realize these deductions 
in determining whether the realization of these deferred tax assets may be impaired  we make judgments with respect to whether we are likely to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize these assets 
in order to reverse a valuation allowance  us gaap guidance requires us to review our cumulative twelve quarter income loss as well as our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize our net deferred tax assets 
during fiscal  we conducted quarterly reviews of each of our subsidiaries and as of december   we concluded that it was appropriate to release all of the valuation allowance  or million  related to our us subsidiaries 
we also concluded that it was appropriate to increase the valuation allowance for one of our chinese subsidiaries by  to  thereby maintaining a full reserve on the deferred tax assets of that subsidiary 
our total valuation allowance on our consolidated deferred tax assets as of december   is  we also released an additional million of valuation allowance due to the change in deferred tax assets for which we maintained a full valuation allowance 
in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions  however  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as the related net interest 
we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction  various states and foreign jurisdictions 
we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction  various states and foreign jurisdictions 
our through state income tax returns are open to audit by the california franchise tax board under the applicable statute of limitations 
we are also subject to examination in various other jurisdictions for various periods 
our federal returns are still open under the applicable statute of limitations for fiscal years through  and business combinations in accordance with business combination accounting  we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
we may engage third party appraisal firms to assist management in determining the fair values of acquired intangible assets such as trade name and customer relationships 
such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 

table of contents valuation of goodwill and long lived assets we evaluate our intangible assets in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb guidance regarding accounting for the impairment of goodwill and long lived assets for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable  such as an adverse change in our business climate or a decline in the overall industry in the case of goodwill and other factors as discussed below in the case of long lived assets  that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or a long lived assets below its carrying amount 
we did not have any goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  or december  currently  our only intangible asset is tradename 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  or significant negative industry or economic trends 
in accordance with the fasb s guidance regarding accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we test other long lived assets  including property  equipment and leasehold improvements and other intangible assets subject to amortization  for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable 
we assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group 
if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable  we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using the income approach  which is the present value technique used to measure the fair value of future cash flow produced by each asset group  and compare it to its carrying value 
the excess of the carrying value over the fair value is the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill or long lived assets is subjective and requires significant judgment on matters such as  but not limited to  the reporting unit at which goodwill should be measured for impairment and the asset group to be tested for recoverability 
we are also required to make estimates that may significantly impact the outcome of the analyses 
such estimates include  but are not limited to  future operating performance and cash flows  cost of capital  terminal values  control premiums and remaining economic lives of assets 
equity incentives to employees we have accounted for stock based compensation under the fasb s guidance regarding stock based compensation and the sec s guidance requiring the use of option pricing models 
the black scholes option pricing model that we use was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short lived exchange traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
in addition  option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the option s expected life and the price volatility of underlying stock 
our expected stock price volatility assumption was determined using the historical volatility of our common stock 
we determined that historical volatility reflects market conditions and is a good indicator of future volatility 
our expected term represents the period that our stock based awards are expected to be outstanding and was determined based on our historical experience with similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock based awards and vesting schedules 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a detailed description 
unaudited quarterly financial results the following table sets forth statement of operations data  in thousands  for the periods indicated 
the information for each of these periods is unaudited and has been prepared on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements included herein and includes all adjustments  consisting only of normal 
table of contents recurring adjustments that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of our unaudited operations data for the periods presented 
historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected in the future in thousands first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter fiscal year sales gross profit net income sales gross profit net income our operating results for fiscal reflect the reversal of a tax valuation allowance of million in the fourth quarter 
liquidity and capital resources we have required capital principally to fund our working capital needs  satisfy our debt obligations  maintain our equipment and purchase new capital equipment 
as of december   we had unrestricted cash of million compared to million as of december  for fiscal year  we generated cash from operating activities of million compared to using cash of million for fiscal year operating cash flows generated for fiscal year were from million of net income  net non cash activity  including depreciation and amortization of million and stock based compensation of million  decreases in accounts receivable of million and inventory of million 
offsetting cash inflows were decreases in accounts payable of million and accrued compensation of million  an increase in deferred income tax of million and a decrease of million in inventory 
our cash inflows flows from operations in any given period are largely driven by the timing of sales  the collection of accounts receivable and the payment of accounts payable  principally inventory related 
net cash used in investing activities for fiscal year increased to million from million for fiscal year capital expenditures for fiscal year reflect our continued investment in our asian subsidiaries as well as our domestic operating units 
net cash used in financing activities for fiscal year was million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million for fiscal year for fiscal year  our cash used in financing activities was due to payments on our term loans of million  offset by proceeds from option exercises and our employee stock purchase program of million and excess tax benefits from stock based compensation of million 
we anticipate that our existing cash balance and operating cash flow  together with available borrowings under our credit facility  will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements and technology development projects for at least the next twelve months 
the adequacy of these resources to meet our liquidity needs beyond that period will depend on our growth  the state of the worldwide economy  the cyclical expansion or contraction of the semiconductor capital equipment industry and the other industries we serve and capital expenditures required to meet possible increased demand for our products 
however  in order to expand our business or acquire additional complementary businesses or technologies  we may need to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings 
if required  additional financing may not be available on terms that are favorable to us  if at all 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of 
table of contents equity or convertible debt securities  our stockholders equity interest will be diluted and these securities might have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of our current stockholders 
no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available or that  if available  such financing can be obtained on terms favorable to our stockholders and us 
the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries at december  are considered to be indefinitely reinvested and no distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise  as well as related provisions for us income taxes  have been provided thereon 
we anticipate that we have adequate liquidity and capital resources at the subsidiary level and would not need to repatriate earnings to the us however  should our cash requirements change  we could repatriate cash to the us  but would likely incur additional taxes and penalties 
borrowing arrangements we have borrowing arrangements with our banking facility which includes a million revolving credit facility and two term loans 
the aggregate amount of the revolving credit facility  which matures on december   is subject to a borrowing base equal to of eligible accounts receivable and of eligible inventory total eligible inventory not to exceed million and is secured by substantially all of our assets 
the revolving credit facility bears interest per annum at a variable rate equal to the greater of prime rate  as defined in the loan agreement  plus a margin of basis points 
during the third quarter ended september   the interest rate on the revolving credit facility decreased to from  which was the interest rate during the first six months of the interest rate at december  on the revolving credit facility was 
the revolving credit facility contains certain reporting and financial covenants that must be met on a quarterly basis in order for us to remain in compliance 
we were in compliance with all of its bank covenants as of december  the revolving credit facility balance as of december  was million 
as of december   we had two term loans with our banking facility  one for million which matured on january  and one for million which matures on october  the term loans bear interest per annum at a variable rate equal to the greater of prime rate  as defined per the loan agreement  plus a margin of basis points 
during the third quarter ended september   the interest rate on the outstanding term loans decreased to from  which was the interest rate during the first six months of the interest rate at december  on the term loans was 
the combined balance of the term loans as of december  was million 
we also had a million equipment loan that we paid in full in may the interest rate and outstanding balance on the equipment loan was and million  respectively  as of december  total debt outstanding as of december   was million 
capital expenditures capital expenditures were million for fiscal year  primarily due to domestic investment and continued investment in our asian subsidiaries 

table of contents contractual obligations other than operating leases for certain equipment and real estate  we have no off balance sheet transactions  unconditional purchase obligations or similar instruments and  other than the revolving credit facility and term loans described above  are not a guarantor of any other entities debt or other financial obligations 
the following table summarizes our future minimum lease payments  principal payments under debt obligations and our purchase obligations for the purchase of inventory as of december  in thousands thereafter total capital lease operating lease borrowing arrangements purchase obligations total operating lease expense reflects a the lease for our headquarters facility in hayward  california that expires in  b the leases for manufacturing facilities in south san francisco that expire in thru  c the leases for manufacturing facilities in china and singapore that expire in thru and  d the leases for manufacturing facilities in austin  texas that expire in we have options to renew certain of the leases in south san francisco  hayward and austin which we expect to exercise 
as a result of the implementation of fasb s guidance regarding accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  we have recorded an additional tax liability of  to offset the recognition of previously recorded excess tax benefits 
because of the uncertainty surrounding the future payment of these liabilities  the amount has been excluded from the table above 
recently issued accounting standards in september  the fasb issued authoritative guidance to allow entities to use a qualitative approach to test goodwill for impairment 
this authoritative guidance permits an entity to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
if it is concluded that this is the case  it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
otherwise  the two step goodwill impairment test is not required 
this guidance is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  and earlier adoption is permitted 
currently  the implementation of this authoritative guidance would have no impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income to require an entity to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
this authoritative guidance eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of equity 
in december  the requirement regarding the presentation of reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income was deferred indefinitely 
the new guidance  except for the provision deferred  is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal year  with early adoption permitted  and should be applied retrospectively 
the implementation of this authoritative guidance will change only the presentation of comprehensive income and will have no impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued authoritative guidance to provide a consistent definition of fair value and ensure that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between us gaap and international financial reporting standards 
this authoritative guidance limits the highest and best use measure to nonfinancial assets  permits certain financial assets and liabilities with offsetting positions in market or counterparty credit risks to be measured at a net basis  and provides guidance on the applicability of premiums and discounts 
this authoritative guidance also expands the disclosures on level inputs by requiring 
table of contents quantitative disclosure of the unobservable inputs and assumptions  as well as description of the valuation processes and the sensitivity of the fair value to changes in unobservable inputs 
the new guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal year the implementation of this authoritative guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on business combinations 
this authoritative guidance requires a public entity that presents comparative financial statements to disclose the revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combinations that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the prior annual reporting period 
in addition  this authoritative guidance expands the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
this authoritative guidance is effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  the implementation of this authoritative guidance had no impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of changes in value of financial instruments caused by fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
foreign exchange rates currently  a significant majority of our sales and arrangements with third party suppliers provide for pricing and payment in us dollars  and  therefore  are not subject to material exchange rate fluctuations 
therefore  we do not expect foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to have a material effect on our results of operations 
however  increases in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive relative to competing products priced in such other currencies  which could negatively impact our ability to compete 
conversely  decreases in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies could result in our foreign suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us 
chinese authorities recently relaxed controls of its currency  the renminbi  and allowed the currency to strengthen against other world currencies  including the us dollar 
we continue to monitor any potential impact of the appreciation of the renminbi on our operations in china as well as globally 
changes in the value of the renminbi did not have a material impact on our results of operations for any of fiscal years  or interest rates our interest rate risk relates primarily to our third party debt which totalled million as of december  and carries interest rates pegged to the prime rate 
an immediate increase in interest rates of basis points would increase our interest expense by less than million per quarter 
this would be partially offset by increased interest income on our invested cash 
conversely  an immediate decline of basis points in interest rates would decrease our interest expense by less than million per quarter 
this would be partially offset by decreased interest income on our invested cash
