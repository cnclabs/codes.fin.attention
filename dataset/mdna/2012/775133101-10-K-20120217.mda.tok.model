business overview company background and strategy we are a global enterprise that provides our customers with innovative solutions and industry leading products in a variety of markets  including portable communications  communications infrastructure  consumer electronics  mass transit  automotive  defense and clean technology 
we generate revenues and cash flows through the development  manufacture  and distribution of specialty material based products that are sold to multiple customers  primarily original equipment manufacturers oems and contract manufacturers that  in turn  produce component products that are sold to end customers for use in various applications 
as such  our business is highly dependent  although indirectly  on market demand for these end user products 
our ability to forecast future sales growth is largely dependent on management s ability to anticipate changing market conditions and how our customers will react to these changing conditions 
it is also highly limited due to the short lead times demanded by our customers and the dynamics of serving as a relatively small supplier in the overall supply chain for these end user products 
in addition  our sales represent a number of different products across a wide range of price points and distribution channels that do not always allow for meaningful quantitative analysis of changes in demand or price per unit with respect to the effect on sales and earnings 
strategically  our current focus is on three mega trends that we believe will fuel the future growth of our company growth of the internet  expansion of mass transit  and further investment in clean technology 
these trends and their related markets all require materials that perform to the highest standards  which has been a key strength of our products over the years 
we are also focused on growing our business both organically and through strategic acquisitions or technology investments that will add to or expand our product portfolio  as well as strengthen our presence in existing markets or expand into new ones 
we will continue to focus on business opportunities and invest in expansion around the globe 
in the first quarter of  we finalized the acquisition of curamik and  over the course of  made significant progress on our new manufacturing operations for our printed circuit materials pcm operating segment on our campus in suzhou  china 
once these operations are complete  pcm will have a manufacturing presence in each of its three major geographic locations north america  europe  and asia further solidifying our commitment to be close to our customers in order to better serve their needs 
our vision is to be the leading  innovative  growth oriented  and high technology materials solutions provider for our selective markets 
to achieve this vision  we must have an organization that can cost effectively develop  produce and market products and services that provide clear advantages for our customers and markets 
executive summary was another very strong year for rogers  particularly over the first three quarters of the year 
overall  our sales for were million  an increase of from the million achieved in sales included million for curamik electronics solutions ces  a record sales year for the business 
excluding ces  sales growth attributable to our legacy business was million  or 
this growth was driven by double digit percentage sales growth across all of our core strategic operating segments  led by high performance foams hpf at  printed circuit materials pcm at and power distribution systems pds at  while being partially offset by the loss of approximately million in sales from distribution activities related to our former joint venture with mitsui chemicals  inc of japan  polyimide laminate systems  llc pls distribution business  which came to end of life late in we also increased our profitability  as we achieved of earnings per diluted share from continuing operations as compared to in however  the sales and earnings achieved in the first three quarters of the year were tempered by a decline in sales and profitability in the fourth quarter of  as certain of our operating segments  particularly ces  pcm and pds  and  to a lesser extent  hpf  experienced softening in sales volumes and orders 
we believe that the economic crisis in europe  and the slow down of growth and spending in china  particularly on infrastructure projects in railway and wind and solar power  had the greatest impact on this performance 
however  we also experienced greater softening than expected in our pcm segment for the wireless infrastructure market  as orders slowed toward the end of the quarter 
we believe a portion of this demand reduction was primarily due to aggressive year end inventory management across the supply chain 
although our visibility into the future is limited  we believe that these situations will adversely impact our operations in the short term  but expect that ordering could increase during the second half of was also a year of change for our company 
in the fourth quarter of  we welcomed a new president and chief executive officer  bruce hoechner  to the rogers team 
mr 
hoechner joins us after spending the majority of his career with rohm and haas and  most recently  the dow chemical company 
mr 
hoechner has broad leadership experience across numerous geographies  businesses and functions in the specialty chemicals industry with particularly strong international business expertise 
as a result of the downturn in the business in the fourth quarter of and continued softness in the beginning of  the senior management team determined that action had to be taken in order to better position rogers for future success and to enable us to achieve our vision of becoming a leading innovative  growth oriented high technology materials solutions provider for our selective markets 
we believe that  in order to achieve our goals  we must transform our company to focus on actions that will help us attain our objectives  including being a more streamlined company  both from an organizational and a cost perspective 
to begin this process  we made the strategic decision to end the operations of our thermal management solutions tms segment 
this business had not been able to achieve our objectives since we acquired the technology a few years ago  and recent developments had further diminished future prospects 
we expect this decision will favorably impact our results going forward by eliminating the losses sustained by the segment since its acquisition 
this will also allow us to redeploy key resources in other areas to continue fueling our growth initiatives 
further  in the first quarter of we realigned the senior leadership of the company by consolidating a number of senior executive positions 
we are also pursuing other initiatives aimed at further reducing our cost structure in order to make us a more streamlined organization  enabling us to continue to grow our company both from a sales and earnings perspective 
we expect these initiatives to extend over the course of several quarters and  ultimately  position our company to achieve its strategic vision  while increasing value to our shareholders 
segment realignment in the first quarter of  due to the acquisition of curamik and the manner in which we manage our business  we determined that it was appropriate to adjust our segment reporting structure 
our previous reporting structure was comprised of three business categories core strategic  development stage  and other 
our new structure eliminates the development stage category and expands the core strategic category  as shown in the below table old structure new structure core strategic core strategic high performance foams high performance foams printed circuit materials printed circuit materials power distribution systems power electronics solutions development stage curamik electronics solutions custom electrical components power distribution systems other other in the new structure  we created a new category called power electronics solutions  which is comprised of two operating segments curamik electronics solutions and power distribution systems 
we now separately report the results of operations for these segments 
also  we eliminated the development stage category  as the custom electrical components segment will now be aggregated in other 
management concluded that the development activities at the custom electrical components segment were not gaining traction in the market and  therefore  suspended most of the development efforts associated with the segment 
this new structure aligns our reporting with management s current view of the business  particularly as we work to further penetrate our core target mega trend markets 
results of continuing operations the following table sets forth  for the last three fiscal years  selected company operating data expressed as a percentage of net sales 
net sales gross margins selling and administrative expenses research and development expenses restructuring and impairment charges operating income loss equity income in unconsolidated joint ventures other income  net interest income  net acquisition disposal gain income loss from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense income loss from continuing operations vs 
net sales net sales in were million  an increase of from million of sales in sales included approximately million related to curamik  which was acquired at the beginning of excluding curamik  organic growth was approximately million  or 
this sales increase was attributable to volume improvement across all of our core strategic segments  led by high performance foams  which increased by from million in to million in  printed circuit materials  which increased by from million in to million in  and the power distribution systems segment  which increased by from million to million 
a primary driver of these increases was the strong demand for the industry leading products and materials produced by these segments  particularly over the first nine months of  as volumes declined in the fourth quarter as discussed in the executive summary section above 
additional factors impacting these results are discussed in greater detail in the segment sales and operations section below 
manufacturing margins manufacturing margins decreased by approximately from in to in during  margins were impacted by several factors  many of which were anticipated and planned for by management 
most notably  such factors included the start up costs associated with our new pcm manufacturing facility in suzhou  china  and our pds operations in north america  increased costs of certain raw materials used in many of our production processes  and unfavorable product sales mix in certain segments 
as we move into the production phase in these new production facilities  we expect the start up and qualification costs to decline and margins to improve over time 
also  margins were negatively impacted by the acquisition of curamik  which has historically operated at lower margins than our legacy operations 
however  curamik has lower operating costs  so overall profitability is very similar to our core businesses 
further  margins were negatively impacted by a one time charge of approximately million recorded in the first quarter of related to the write up of curamik inventory to fair value  as required under the purchase accounting rules 
sequentially  margins improved over the first three quarter of  but declined significantly in the fourth quarter due to the decline in sales and a negative impact from inventory absorption 
we anticipate lower margins in the first half of at current sales levels as we work to manage our inventory levels  but anticipate improvements if and when our sales volumes begin to improve as progresses 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative s a expenses were million in  an increase of million  or  from million in the increase in expenses is partially attributable to the acquisition of curamik  which added approximately million of expense during the year  which includes million of costs incurred to acquire the business and approximately million in amortization expense related to the intangible assets created as part of the purchase 
also contributing to the increase were approximately million in one time charges incurred in the fourth quarter of associated with the acceleration of compensation expense related to the change of chief executive officers during the quarter 
we will incur additional charges in the third quarter of related to the settlement of the former chief executive officer s pension benefits  which we estimate will result in additional expense of approximately million and a cash payout of approximately million 
further contributing to the increase were incremental sales and marketing costs of approximately million incurred to support our higher sales volumes and future growth initiatives 
these increases were partially offset by a net decline in incentive and equity compensation costs of approximately million  as well as declines in spending in certain areas as a result of the cost control measures that have been in place due to the recession 
as a percentage of sales  overall selling and administrative expense declined significantly to in from in this decline was partially driven by our ability to grow sales organically and absorb a significant acquisition in curamik without materially increasing our s a spending 
also  curamik s overall operating costs are lower as a percentage of sales than our legacy segments costs  which helped contribute to the percentage decline 
research and development expenses research and development r d expenses were million in  an increase of million  or  from million in as a percentage of sales  r d expenses were in and in historically  we have targeted a r d investment as a percentage of net sales  however  with our sales growth we believe that our short term r d investment rate will be in the range 
going forward  we will continue to invest in research and development to improve our existing technologies and find new applications for these materials  as well as to explore new  emerging technologies  as well as existing technologies  that we believe will complement our existing product portfolio 
restructuring and impairment charges in the first quarter of  we signed an agreement to sell our facility in richmond  virginia for million 
we acquired this facility as part of the mti acquisition and subsequently moved operations from richmond to our high performance foams manufacturing facility in carol stream  illinois  so the facility has been vacant and classified as held for sale since this facility had a book value of approximately million prior to the signing of the agreement  and we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million as of december   which represents the write down to the selling price less approximately million of estimated selling costs 
we expect the transaction to close in the second quarter of equity income in unconsolidated joint ventures equity income in unconsolidated joint ventures was million in  a decrease of million from million in results included approximately million of equity income related to the rcct joint venture  which was divested in the fourth quarter of the remaining year over year decrease is attributable to a decline in performance at our foam joint ventures  rogers inoac suzhou ris in china and rogers inoac corporation ric in japan 
other income expense  net other income was million in  an increase of million from million in the increase is primarily due to a gain of approximately million on the sale of a building in china  partially offset by an unfavorable impact of million related to foreign currency fluctuations and our related hedging program 
also  results included commission income of million from pls  which did not recur in realized investment loss realized investment loss is the portion of the auction rate security impairment that relates to credit losses and is required to be recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
the amount of loss recognized in was million  a decrease from the million loss recognized in the change is attributable to market conditions surrounding the securities underlying the auction rate securities  as well as redemption of a tranche of auction rate securities during at less than par value 
interest income expense  net interest income expense  net went from million of interest income in to million of interest expense in the interest expense is primarily due to the recognition of million of expense related to our long term debt obligations resulting from the funding of the curamik acquisition in the first quarter of additionally  in  we incurred approximately million of expense associated with a capital lease obligation that we acquired as part of the curamik acquisition 
income taxes our effective tax rate was in and in in both and  our tax rate was favorably impacted by the tax benefit associated with certain discrete rate items recorded during the year and also benefited from favorable tax rates on certain foreign business activity 
in  our effective tax rate was also favorably impacted by the release of a portion of the valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets 
in the fourth quarter of  we developed a tax planning strategy that would allow us to recognize certain deferred tax assets  resulting in a partial reduction of our valuation allowance 
we believe that this strategy is reasonable  prudent  and feasible  and we will implement this strategy  if need be  to ensure that this portion of our deferred tax asset does not expire 
in both and  we had cumulative losses in the us as the realization of deferred taxes is principally dependent upon the achievement of future taxable income  the estimation of which requires significant management judgment  we concluded that given the weight of both positive and negative evidence  a valuation allowance should be placed against the remaining portion of our us deferred tax assets  for which there is neither a tax planning strategy nor source of taxable income against which it would offset 
the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable  however  could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced or increased 
furthermore  if objective negative evidence in the form of recent cumulative losses is no longer present  additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such as our projections for future taxable income 
our tax holiday on the earnings of our subsidiaries in china expired at the end of under the business license agreement granted to rogers technologies suzhou company rsz  a wholly owned subsidiary of ours  the first two years of cumulatively profitable operations were taxed at a zero percent tax rate followed by a reduced tax rate in subsequent years that gradually increased to the full rate of tax beginning in in  rsz reported pretax income of million which was subject to a tax rate of 
in  rsz reported pretax income of million  which was subject to a tax rate of 
under the business license agreement granted to rogers shanghai international trading company ltd 
rsh  also a wholly owned subsidiary of ours  rsh was subject to a reduced rate of tax that gradually increased to the full rate of tax beginning in in  rsh reported pretax income of million which was subject to a tax rate of 
in  rsh reported pretax income of million which was subject to a tax rate of 
backlog our backlog of firm orders was million at december   as compared to million at december  the decrease at the end of was primarily related to the decreased customer demand across almost all of our businesses  with the largest impact at pds  which experienced a decrease in backlog of million at december  as compared to december  vs 
net sales net sales in were million  an increase of from million of sales in the increase in sales is attributable to increases in our core strategic segments  most notably our high performance foams segment  which increased by year over year  and our printed circuit materials segment  which increased by 
a primary driver of these increases was the strong demand for the industry leading products and materials produced by these segments  particularly as the global economy began to recover from the recessionary environment that existed in  which had a significant negative impact on our overall business 
additional factors impacting these results are discussed in greater detail in the segment sales and operations section below 
manufacturing margins manufacturing margins increased by over to in from in margins increased at all of our segments  with the most significant increases occurring in our high performance foams and power distribution systems segments with year over year percentage increases of and  respectively  in as compared to margins in were significantly impacted by the volume declines experienced during the year  particularly in the first half of the year as margins in the first quarter of our low point for sales were approximately 
during  sales volume increases  as well as our cost cutting initiatives that began early in  helped to drive the significant margin improvements 
our margins will continue to be driven to a large extent by both our volume levels  product mix  and overall cost structure 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses were million in  an increase of million from million in expenses increased primarily due to costs associated with various incentive compensation plans  including the annual bonus plan  equity compensation plans that include stock options and restricted stock  and sales commissions programs  which all increased as a result of our strong operational performance in as compared to the increase in costs can also be attributed to elevated spending levels necessary to support our higher sales levels achieved in versus results included approximately million of costs associated with the acquisitions of utis in the second quarter of and curamik  which closed early in the first quarter of  along with a gain of million from the proceeds received from the settlement of a previously filed suit against fireman s fund insurance company related to the calamp lawsuit in results included approximately million of one time costs related to a product liability claim on our printed circuit material products and million of costs associated with the integration of mti global  inc operations  as well as approximately million of incremental costs related to our defined benefit pension plan as a result of the decline in asset value during overall  as a percentage of sales  selling and administrative expenses remained relatively consistent year over year  at and for and  respectively 
research and development expenses research and development expenses were million in both and overall  as a percentage of sales  r d expenses were in line with expectations at in and in in  our strategic plan was to invest an average of of net sales annually into research and development 
however  in a period of rising sales  research and development expenditures do not increase at the pace of sales  therefore  there is often a delay in meeting our targeted investment level  which resulted in the decline in going forward  we will continue to invest in research and development to improve our existing technologies and find new applications for these materials  as well as to explore new  emerging technologies  as well as existing technologies  that we believe will complement our existing product portfolio 
with our acquisition of curamik  we will reevaluate our targeted long term spending rate and adjust our spending targets  if necessary  in the future 
restructuring and impairment charges during  we recorded approximately million in restructuring and impairment charges of which million was recorded in cost of sales on our consolidated statements of operations 
the restructuring and impairment charges were comprised of the following million in charges related to the impairment of certain long lived assets in the following operating segments other  for the business of flexible circuit materials million and the business of custom electrical components million  high performance foams million and printed circuit materials million  million in severance related to a global workforce reduction  and million in charges related to additional inventory reserves related to the restructuring of our custom electrical components and flexible circuit materials operating segments  which was recorded in cost of sales on our consolidated statements of operations 
these charges are discussed in greater detail below 
flexible circuit materials in the second quarter of as part of our strategic planning process  our management team determined that we would exit the flexible circuit materials market and effectively discontinue any new product development or research in this area 
over the previous several years  the flexible circuit materials market had experienced increased commoditization of its products  resulting in increased competition and extreme pricing pressures 
in  we had taken certain initial actions to streamline our flexible circuit materials business  including shifting production of certain products to our joint venture in taiwan  and retaining only certain  higher margin products 
however  in  we determined that the future markets for these products were very limited and did not fit with the strategic direction of the company 
therefore  we determined that we would immediately stop production of certain remaining flexible circuit materials products and continue to support only select customers for a limited time period going forward  ultimately resulting in the abandonment of our wholly owned flexible circuit materials business 
as a result of these management decisions  we determined it appropriate to evaluate the assets related to this business for potential impairment 
this analysis resulted in an impairment charge related to specific equipment located in our belgian facility 
this equipment was to be used primarily for the development of certain flexible circuit materials related products  however  based on the decision to abandon the business  this equipment was no longer of use to us 
we recognized an impairment charge of approximately million related to this equipment and wrote it down to an estimated salvage value of approximately million 
this charge was reported in the restructuring and impairment line item in our consolidated statements of operations 
we also recorded an impairment charge on a building located in suzhou  china that was built to support our flexible circuit materials business in the asian marketplace 
the impairment charge was reported in the restructuring and impairment line item in our consolidated statements of operations 
in the first quarter of we sold this building 
further  as part of the decision to exit the flexible circuit materials business  we recorded additional reserves on certain inventory that will no longer be sold  of approximately million 
this charge was reported as part of cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations 
lastly  we also recorded an impairment charge in on certain other assets pertaining to the flexible circuit materials business in asia of approximately million  which was reported in the restructuring and impairment line item in our consolidated statements of operations 
these charges were reported in our other reportable segment 
custom electrical components over the past few years  our custom electrical components cec electroluminescent el lamp business has steadily declined as new technologies have emerged to replace these lamps in cell phone and other related applications 
in the second quarter of  we took initial steps to restructure the cec business for this decline  as we shifted the majority of manufacturing to our china facility and recorded impairment charges on certain us based assets 
since that time  we have continued to produce el lamps out of our china facility at gradually declining volumes and our management team has initiated efforts to develop new product applications using our screen printing technology 
our initial forecasts indicated the potential for new applications to go to market in the second half of  however  we had not successfully developed any new applications that would generate material cash flows in the future 
we concluded that this situation  plus the fact that our el lamp production was primarily limited to automotive applications as there were no longer material sales into the handheld market as of the second quarter of  was an indicator of impairment 
the resulting analysis concluded that these assets should be treated as abandoned  as they are not in use and we did not anticipate the assets being placed in use in the near future 
as such  these assets were written down to their current fair value  which in this case approximates salvage value as there is not a readily available market for these assets since the technology is becoming obsolete 
therefore  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million related to these assets  resulting in a remaining book value of approximately million 
this charge is reported in the restructuring and impairment line item in our consolidated statement of operations 
further  as a result of reaching end of life on certain handheld applications  we recorded additional inventory reserves of approximately million  as this inventory no longer had any value or future use 
this charge was reported as part of cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations 
during the fourth quarter of  as a result of the continued decline in the cec business  as described above  we made the decision to market for sale the cec facility located in chandler  arizona 
as a result of this decision  the fair value of the building was appraised at approximately million  resulting in an impairment charge of million 
this charge was reported in the restructuring and impairment charges line item in our consolidated statement of operations 
the building  which has note yet been sold  does not meet the definition of an asset held for sale  per the relevant accounting guidance  and therefore it is classified as property  plant and equipment on our consolidated statements of financial position at december  these charges were reported in our other reportable segment 
high performance foams during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge of million on our manufacturing facility located in richmond  virginia which was acquired as part of the acquisition of certain assets of mti global inc the building was classified as an asset held for sale when acquired in the second quarter of market conditions at the time resulted in the fourth quarter impairment charge 
this charge was recorded in our high performance foams operating segment 
printed circuit materials early in  management determined based on forecasts at that time  that we would need additional capacity for our high frequency products later that year 
management had already undertaken initiatives to build additional capacity through a new facility on our china campus  but needed a solution to fill interim capacity needs 
therefore  we initiated efforts to move idle equipment from our belgian facility to our arizona facility and incurred costs of approximately million due to these efforts 
at the end of  our overall business began to decline due in part to the global recession  and management determined that we would not need this equipment at that time but that we would still need certain capacity later in prior to the china capacity coming on line 
however  in  business did not recover as quickly as anticipated and we believed that we would not need this equipment as we had sufficient capacity to meet our current needs and the china facility would be available in time to satisfy any increase in demand 
therefore  we determined that the costs incurred related to the relocation of this equipment should be impaired and equipment purchased or refurbished as part of the relocation should be written down to an estimated salvage value  resulting in a charge of approximately million  which is reflected in the restructuring and impairment charges line item on our consolidated statements of operations 
these charges were reported in our printed circuit materials operating segment 
severance in the first half of  we announced certain cost reduction initiatives that included a workforce reduction and a significant reduction in our operating and overhead expenses in an effort to better align our cost structure with the lower sales volumes experienced at the end of and in as a result  we recognized approximately million in severance charges in  and paid out approximately million in severance during a summary of the activity in the severance accrual as of december  was as follows dollars in thousands balance at december  provisions payments balance at december  these charges were included in the restructuring and impairment charges line item on our consolidated statements of operations and were reported across all segments 
we did not record any restructuring or impairment charges during equity income in unconsolidated joint ventures equity income in unconsolidated joint ventures increased million from million in to million in the year over year increase was primarily attributable to the strong performance of our foam joint ventures  rogers inoac suzhou ris in china and rogers inoac corporation ric in japan  as business rebounded significantly from the recession driven declines and excess inventory levels experienced in during  we sold our interest in rcct to our partner  chang chun plastics  ltd 
in the fourth quarter of  effectively completing our exit of the flexible circuit materials business 
prior to the sale of our interest  rcct was slightly accretive to our results in other income expense  net other income increased from million in to million in the increase was primarily due to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and our related hedging program  which collectively contributed approximately million in unfavorable net adjustments in  compared to million in favorable net adjustments in the foreign currency fluctuations were offset by the pls commission activity for each year 
we dissolved the pls joint venture in the first quarter of  resulting in only million in commission income for  compared to million in realized investment loss realized investment loss is the portion of the auction rate security impairment that relates to credit losses 
the amount increased in from a loss of million to a loss of million 
the change was attributable to market conditions surrounding the underlying securities of the auction rate securities 
income taxes our effective tax rate was in  and in in  our effective tax rate was favorably impacted by the release of a portion of the valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets 
in the fourth quarter of  we developed a tax planning strategy that would allow us to recognize certain deferred tax assets  resulting in a partial reduction of our valuation allowance 
we believe that this strategy is reasonable  prudent  and feasible  and we will implement this strategy  if need be  to ensure that this portion of our deferred tax asset does not expire 
in both and  we had cumulative losses in the us as the realization of deferred taxes is principally dependent upon the achievement of future taxable income  the estimation of which requires significant management judgment  we concluded that given the weight of both positive and negative evidence  a valuation allowance should be placed against the remainder of our us deferred tax assets  for which there is neither a tax planning strategy nor source of taxable income against which it would offset 
in  our effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by recording a valuation allowance charge of million against our us deferred tax asset 
also  in both and  our tax rate was favorably impacted by the tax benefit associated with certain discrete rate items recorded during the year and continued to benefit from favorable tax rates on certain foreign business activity 
our tax holiday on the earnings of our subsidiaries in china expired at the end of under the business license agreement granted to rogers technologies suzhou company rsz  a wholly owned subsidiary of ours  the first two years of cumulatively profitable operations were taxed at a zero percent tax rate followed by a reduced tax rate in subsequent years that gradually increased to the full rate of tax beginning in in  rsz reported pretax income of million  which was subject to a tax rate of

backlog our backlog of firm orders was million at december   as compared to million at december  the increase at the end of was primarily related to the increased customer demand reflected in the increase in sales in the printed circuit materials and power distribution systems operating segments 
backlog for printed circuit materials increased by approximately million at year end as compared to year end  while backlog for power distribution systems increased by approximately million at year end as compared to year end segment sales and operations core strategic high performance foams dollars in millions net sales operating income our high performance foams operating segment is comprised of our polyurethane and silicone foam products 
vs 
net sales in this segment increased by  from million in to million in operating profits increased significantly as well  improving by approximately from million in to million in the results include approximately million of integration costs associated with the acquisition of utis in the second quarter of results were driven by strong demand for the segment s foams across almost all product lines and in geographic regions 
in particular  we continue to experience success with our polyurethane foam products in cushioning  sealing and energy management for portable electronic devices  particularly large touch screen mobile internet devices 
sales of our silicone foams gained momentum in due to increased demand in various markets  including aircraft  communications infrastructure  solar power  and hybrid electric vehicle applications 
hpf also gained traction in one of its newest product lines  poron molded components  primarily for applications in sports and impact apparel  as well as mobile internet devices 
like most of our other segments  hpf experienced a decline in sales volumes in the fourth quarter of  which we believe is driven by the rationalizing of inventory in the marketplace  as well as the global economic trends discussed in the executive summary section above 
we also believe this decline to be temporary and expect volumes to increase again in the middle to second half of vs 
net sales in this segment increased by over from million in to million in operating profits also increased substantially  more than tripling in to million as compared to million in the results include approximately million of integration costs associated with the acquisition of utis in the second quarter of and results include approximately million of integration costs associated with the acquisition of certain assets of mti global  inc mti 
also includes severance costs of approximately million related to the mti asset acquisition and the worldwide workforce reduction initiated in the first half of the year 
results were driven by strong demand for the segment s foams across almost all product lines and in all geographic regions 
in particular  our industry leading products for cushioning  sealing and protecting sensitive components in mobile internet devices were in high demand  specifically in large touch screen display tablets 
additionally  sales of products that meet stringent industry standards in the mass transit market  particularly seating and sealing applications  were strong during as compared to in  sales levels reached their lowest point in the first half of the year during the peak of the recession 
during the second half of  we began to experience a turnaround in the market as our sales and operating results began to improve 
this trend continued in as markets continued to improve  resulting in increasing sales volumes and profits during the year

net sales in this segment increased by in to million from million in operating results were relatively consistent year over year from million in to million in results included a one time benefit of million from the recovery of insurance proceeds related to the calamp lawsuit  which had been previously settled in in  the segments growth was driven by strong demand in the wireless infrastructure market  primarily due to expansion of third generation g and fourth generation g systems globally  as well as for antenna radar applications for the high reliability and automotive markets 
demand was also strong for materials used in the aerospace  defense and other high reliability markets  as well as in the automotive market for radar safety sensors and in satellite televisions 
at the end of  particularly in the fourth quarter  sales in this segment declined significantly from levels achieved in the first three quarters of the year 
we believe this decline was driven by the global economic trends discussed in the executive summary section above  as well as the rationalization of inventory in the supply chain 
we also believe this decline to be temporary and expect volumes to increase again in the middle to second half of vs 
net sales in this segment increased by almost from million in to million in accordingly  operating results also improved significantly from an operating profit of million in to million in results included a one time benefit of million from the recovery of insurance proceeds related to the calamp lawsuit  which had been previously settled in results included approximately million of costs related to the impairment of certain equipment  million of additional inventory reserves  million related to a product liability claim and severance charges of million 
the overall improvement in the business from to was driven by the continued strong demand for the segment s materials into the wireless infrastructure market as the pace of third generation g and fourth generation g systems deployments around the world escalated as many of these programs were delayed from due to the recession 
also  sales into defense applications and into the automotive market for blind spot detection devices have increased in as compared to power electronics solutions curamik electronics solutions curamik dollars in millions net sales operating income this operating segment is comprised of power electronic substrate products  which are used primarily in the design of intelligent power management devices  such as insulated gate bipolar transistor igbt modules that enable a wide range of products including highly efficient industrial motor drives  wind and solar energy converters and hybrid electric and electric vehicle hev ev drive systems 
we acquired curamik on january  net sales in this segment were million in and operating profits were million 
these volumes represent a record for this segment  and its performance for the year exceeded our initial expectations with sequential growth in the first three quarters of the year  followed by a decline in sales during the fourth quarter as experienced by all of our core segments 
the overall results were driven by strong demand for the segments products across its primary markets  which consist of energy efficient motor drives  wind and solar power generation  and hev ev applications  and regions  which include europe and japan 
at the end of the year  the decline in volumes was due primarily to lower demand in wind and in general industrial applications  as well as from customers reducing their inventory levels 
we expect this softening to continue through at least the first half of curamik s operating results include approximately million of one time costs associated with the acquisition and integration of the business  including consulting  legal and audit fees  as well as severance charges and other integration costs 
results also included approximately million of non cash amortization charges related to the intangible assets created as part of the purchase of the business see note of the consolidated financial statements of this form k and approximately million of one time non cash charges related to the amortization of the step up of inventory to its fair value at the acquisition date 
power distribution systems power distrubution systems dollars in millions net sales operating income this operating segment is comprised of our busbar products  which are primarily used in mass transit and clean technology applications 
vs 
net sales in this segment increased by from million in to million in  while operating profit increased from million in to million in these increases were driven by strong demand over the first nine months of the year for this segment s products in mass transit and power electronic applications 
in the fourth quarter of  this segment began experiencing softening sales in mass transit and wind turbines 
in particular  the pds segment experienced lower demand for its products in the fourth quarter due primarily to the temporary suspension of railway construction investments by the ministry of railways mor in china as a result of their debt issues and the safety investigation initiated after a train crash in wenzhou  zhejiang province in july   in which two high speed bullet trains collided 
the mor has decided to continue the railway investment plans but at a slightly slower pace than their initial plan 
china is also addressing the issues with wind and solar energy connections to the grid  all of which are unrelated to the performance of our products 
we believe that these issues will ultimately resolved and in the long term could benefit this segment going forward by creating increased demand for its products 
however  in the short term at least over the course of  we believe that these events will negatively impact this segment s results 
vs 
net sales in this segment increased by from million in to million in  while operating profit declined slightly from million in to million in results included approximately million of severance charges associated with the headcount reduction that occurred in early due to a decline in business driven by the recession 
the sales growth in was driven by the particularly strong demand for busbar products in asia for mass transit applications  as investment continues into the infrastructure of that region 
clean technology applications for renewable energy and power electronics also experienced increased demand for these products  particularly across europe and asia 
operating profit  however  declined in primarily due to the absorption of additional overhead charges as a result of the growth of the business in new regions and markets  as well as the changing mix of sales and profits across our businesses and the impact on our allocation methodologies 
other dollars in millions net sales operating income our other reportable segment consists of our elastomer rollers  floats  and non woven composite materials products  as well as our inverter distribution activities 
vs 
in  sales in the segment declined by approximately from million in to million in results included approximately million in sales from distribution activities related to our former joint venture with mitsui chemicals  inc of japan  polyimide laminate systems  llc pls distribution activities  which reached end of life in the remainder of the decline was related to the further decline in the electroluminescent lamps el sales 
however  even though volumes declined  operating profit improved from breakeven in to million in the improvement was driven by sales of inverter products  offset by the end of the pls distribution sales vs 
in  net sales increased from million to million  primarily due to the inclusion of pls  which achieved million in sales in  partially offset by the elimination of million of sales in related to our flexible circuit materials business  which ceased activities prior to the start of the remaining increase is due to the improved performance of our elastomer rollers and floats products 
the segment also became slightly profitable in  mainly due to the strong performance of the elastomer component and floats products and the inclusion of pls 
results included approximately million in asset impairment charges related to equipment and buildings and severance charges of million 
we continuously evaluate the viability of the product portfolio in this segment as it relates to our long term strategic and operational focus 
joint ventures rogers inoac corporation ric ric  our joint venture with japan based inoac corporation  was established over years ago and manufactures high performance poron urethane foam materials in japan 
sales decreased from to  following an increase of from to the decline in sales in was due primarily to the continued weakness in the japanese domestic and export markets  particularly lcd tv s  domestic mobile phones and general industrial applications 
sales in increased significantly due to increases in demand in the communications market 
rogers inoac suzhou corporation ris ris  our joint venture agreement with inoac corporation for the purpose of manufacturing poron urethane foam materials in china  began operations in sales declined from to  from an increase of from to sales levels improved in due primarily to the improvement in the chinese economy  however  in  sales declined due to increased softening in the asian markets it serves 
rogers chang chun technology co  ltd 
rcct rcct  our joint venture with chang chun plastics co  ltd  was established in late to manufacture flexible circuit materials for customers in taiwan 
in the fourth quarter of  we sold our interest in this joint venture to our joint venture partner for million  resulting in a gain of million 
polyimide laminate systems  llc pls pls  our joint venture with mitsui chemicals  inc  sold adhesiveless laminates for trace suspension assemblies 
in the first quarter of  this joint venture was dissolved and we assumed any outstanding assets and liabilities of pls 
we also agreed that  going forward  all distribution activity that pls had previously engaged in would be conducted through rogers 
as of december   this distribution activity was minimal and has since come to end of life entirely 
discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of  we made the strategic decision to end the operations of our thermal management solutions operating segment 
we had invested in its operations in the previous few years  but had difficulty gaining traction in the market and working through issues in the manufacturing process 
therefore  we believed  at that time  that we would not achieve future success in this operation and chose to end operations rather than invest further 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge of million  related to this discontinued operation 
for the fiscal years  and  respectively  million  million  and million of operating losses  net of tax  have been reflected as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
net sales associated with the discontinued operation were million  million and million  respectively  for fiscal  and product and market development our research and development team is dedicated to growing our businesses by developing cost effective solutions that enable or improve upon the performance of customers products  as well as identifying business and technology acquisition opportunities to expand our market presence 
our plan is to invest in the range of of net sales annually into research and development 
going forward  we will continue to invest in research and development to leverage our existing technology to expand our portfolio of product offerings to address customer needs as well as explore new technologies to broaden our product portfolio 
we introduced a variety of new products during for example  our high performance foams business introduced molded poron products for various impact protection applications  adhesive backed poron products to enhance performance and ease of use in mobile internet device sealing and cushioning applications and a new generation of low smoke  toxicity and flammability products for mass transit passenger cars 
our printed circuit materials business introduced a new high performance circuit material for g base station antennas and a new bonding material that enables higher performance multilayer circuit boards in wireless and wired infrastructure applications 
our power distribution business introduced a new ro linx powercircuit product platform that provides high performance electrical interconnects in hybrid and electric vehicle applications 
liquidity  capital resources  and financial position we believe that our ability to generate cash from operations to reinvest in our business is one of our fundamental strengths  as demonstrated by our financial position in for the first time since  we have debt on our balance sheet  as we borrowed million against our credit facilities in the first quarter of to fund the strategic acquisition of curamik 
while the world financial markets have grown more stable since the global recession in  significant volatility still remains and credit markets in general have diminished liquidity and capital availability globally 
we believe that our existing sources of liquidity and future cash flows that are expected to be generated from operations  together with our available credit facilities  will be sufficient to fund our operations  capital expenditures  research and development efforts  and debt service commitments  as well as our other operating and investing needs  for at least the next twelve months 
we continue to have access to the remaining portion of the recently increased line of credit should any issue or strategic opportunity impact the business 
we continually review and evaluate the adequacy of our cash flows  borrowing facilities and banking relationships to ensure that we have the appropriate access to cash to fund both our near term operating needs and our long term strategic initiatives 
cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities at december   and we had cash and cash equivalents of million  million and million  respectively 
the following table illustrates the regional location of our cash and cash equivalents dollars in thousands us europe asia total cash and cash equivalents cash held in certain foreign locations could be subject to additional taxes if we repatriated such amounts back to the us from foreign countries that have a lower tax rate that in the us our current policy is that such earnings and cash will be permanently reinvested in those foreign locations 
working capital was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
cash flows from operating activities were million in compared to million in and million in cash flows from operating activities in were significantly affected by our decreased financial performance 
cash flows from operating assets and liabilities reflected a decrease of million  million and million in  and respectively 
the significant items that impacted our cash flows from operating assets and liabilities included the following an increase in inventories of million in as compared to an increase of million in and a decrease of million in the increase from to is due primarily to the increased sales volumes we have experienced during as customer demand for our products has increased significantly over  as well as to the acquisition of curamik  which added million of inventory during the year 
further  the start up of our new pcm operation in suzhou  china has contributed to the overall inventory increase as we have had to purchase more inventory to support our chinese operations 
we have also had to carry more inventory on hand as certain raw materials are sourced from the us  which increases the amount of time we need to carry our inventory 
an increase in accounts receivable of million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
these increases were due primarily to the sequential year over year increases in sales experienced across our business 
overall  even though gross receivables balances have increased  our accounts receivable collections have been strong  and in line with our internal guidelines related to days sales outstanding  which actually declined from days in to days in receivable balances declined at the end of due primarily to the decline in sales during the fourth quarter of the year 
a decrease in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities of million in  as compared to an increase of million in and a decrease of million in the decrease is primarily due to compensation in the annual incentive compensation plan being lower than additionally  in the fourth quarter of current purchases of raw materials had declined due to lower customer demand 
the increase in was primarily due to the accrual of annual incentive compensation combined with increased purchases of raw materials to meet the increased customer demands 
the decrease in was related to the payout in of the annual incentive compensation plan and the payout of million related to the settlement of the calamp lawsuit 
during  we used million in cash for investing activities as compared to million and million in and the investing activities of include the acquisition of curamik  net of cash acquired  for million 
investing activities in include million related to the purchase of utis  while  in  we used approximately million of cash for the acquisition of certain assets of the mti global  inc business and for a million investment in solicore 
capital expenditures were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
was primarily affected by our initial draw on our line of credit for million to fund the acquisition of curamik 
credit facilities on july   we entered into an amended and restated million  secured  five year credit agreement 
this credit agreement amended credit agreement is with i jpmorgan chase bank  na as administrative agent  ii hsbc bank usa  national association  iii rbs citizens  national association  iv fifth third bank  and v citibank  na jpmorgan securities llc and hsbc bank usa  national association acted as joint bookrunners and joint lead arrangers  hsbc bank usa  national association and rbs citizens  national association acted as co syndication agents  and fifth third bank and citibank  na acted as co documentation agents 
this amended credit agreement amends and restates the credit agreement signed between the company and the same banks on november  and increased our borrowing capacity from million under the original agreement to million under the amended credit agreement 
key features of the amended credit agreement  compared to the november  credit agreement  include an increase in credit from million to million with the addition of a million term loan  the extension of maturity from november  to july   a reduction in interest costs  an increase in the size of permitted acquisitions from million to million  and an increase in permitted additional indebtedness from million to million 
the amended credit agreement provides for the extension of credit in the form of a million term loan which refinances outstanding borrowings in the amount of million from the existing revolving credit line  as further described below  and up to million of revolving loans  in multiple currencies  at any time and from time to time until the maturity of the amended credit agreement on july  we may borrow  pre pay and re borrow amounts under the million revolver portion of the amended credit agreement  however  with respect to the million term loan portion  any principal amounts re paid may not be re borrowed 
borrowings may be used to finance working capital needs  for letters of credit and for the general corporate purposes in the ordinary course of business  including the financing of permitted acquisitions as defined in the amended credit agreement 
borrowings under the amended credit agreement will bear interest based on one of two options 
alternate base rate loans will bear interest that includes a base reference rate plus a spread of basis points  depending on our leverage ratio 
the base reference rate will be the greater of the prime rate  federal funds effective rate plus basis points  and adjusted month london interbank offered libo rate plus basis points 
eurocurrency loans will bear interest based on the adjusted libo rate plus a spread of basis points  depending on our leverage ratio 
in addition to interest payable on the principal amount of indebtedness outstanding from time to time under the amended credit agreement  the company is required to pay a quarterly fee of to based upon our leverage ratio of the unused amount of the lenders commitments under the amended credit agreement 
in connection with its entry into the amended credit agreement  we transferred borrowings in the amount of million from the revolving credit line under the november  credit agreement to the term loan under the amended credit agreement 
the amended credit agreement requires the mandatory quarterly repayment of principal of amounts borrowed under such term loan 
payments commenced on september   and are scheduled to be completed on june  the aggregate payments due each year are as follows million million million million million million we capitalized an additional million of debt issuance costs in the third quarter of related to the amendment of the credit agreement  for a year to date total of million of debt issuance costs capitalized  which will be amortized over the five year life of the amended credit agreement 
the amended credit agreement is secured by many of the assets of rogers and our world properties  inc  subsidiary  including but not limited to  receivables  equipment  intellectual property  inventory  stock in certain subsidiaries and real property 
as part of the amended credit agreement  we are restricted in our ability to perform certain actions  including  but not limited to  our ability to pay dividends  incur additional debt  sell certain assets  and make capital expenditures  with certain exceptions 
the key financial covenants include a requirement for us to maintain  at the end of each fiscal quarter ending on or after june   a fixed charge coverage ratio of no less than to and a leverage ratio of no more than to if an event of default occurs  the lenders may  among other things  terminate their commitments and declare all outstanding borrowings to be immediately due and payable together with accrued interest and fees 
in the first quarter of  we made an initial draw on the line of credit of million to fund the acquisition of curamik 
in we made principal payments of million 
we are in compliance with all financial and other covenants as of december  in addition  at december  we had the following standby letters of credit loc and guarantees that were backed by the amended credit agreement million letter of credit to guarantee rogers workers compensation plan  million letter guarantee to guarantee a payable obligation for a chinese subsidiary rogers shanghai  and million letter guarantee to guarantee a payable obligation for a chinese subsidiary rogers suzhou 
no amounts were owed on the locs as of december  or interest in  we incurred net interest expense  primarily on our outstanding debt  of million  while in we had million of interest income 
cash paid for interest was million for restriction on payment of dividends pursuant to the amended credit agreement  we cannot make a cash dividend payment if a default or event of default has occurred and is continuing or shall result from the cash dividend payment 
capital lease during the first quarter of  we recorded a capital lease obligation related to the acquisition of curamik 
the related obligation recorded as of december  was million 
we have the option to buy out the lease in or in  upon its expiration 
amortization of such capital lease is included within depreciation expense 
we believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations  together with existing long term financing  will be sufficient to fund operations  capital expenditures  and research and development efforts for at least the next twelve months 
financial position the following discusses the significant fluctuations on our balance sheet at december  as compared to december  accounts receivable increased  or million  from million in to million in due primarily to the acquisition of curamik  which added million to our accounts receivable balance  as well as the increased sales during as compared to overall  accounts receivable collections have been strong and in line with our internal guidelines related to days sales outstanding 
inventories increased million  or  from million in to million in the increase is due primarily to the increased sales volumes we have experienced during as customer demand for our products has increased significantly over  as well as to the acquisition of curamik  which added million of inventory 
further  the start up of our new pcm operation in suzhou  china has contributed to the overall inventory increase as we have had to purchase more inventory to support our chinese operations 
we have also had to carry more inventory on hand as certain raw materials are sourced from the us  which increases the amount of time we need to carry our inventory 
goodwill and other intangibles increase of million  or  from million in to million in due primarily to the valuations of the intangible assets and goodwill created as a result of the acquisition of curamik in the first quarter of pension liability increase of million  or  from million in to million in due to market conditions that caused significant changes in the assumptions used to measure the pension liability  specifically a decline in the discount rate and a decline in the projected return on plan assets  as well as the performance of the plan assets during  which were projected at but were effectively flat during the year 
auction rate securities as of december   we held approximately million of auction rate securities at par value as compared to approximately million as of december  at the end of  these securities were classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value based on market valuations at that time level input in accordance with accounting guidance 
however  in the first quarter of  the markets in which these securities traded became illiquid  causing us to reclassify these securities from a level input to a level input  as an active market no longer existed for these securities  and therefore we had to base our valuations on unobservable inputs 
accordingly  our asset value was determined considering several factors  including an estimated time horizon for redeeming such securities  a discount factor to determine the present value of such securities  as well as the quality of the underlying securities  most of which were backed by investment grade student loans or municipalities 
our initial valuations utilized a discount period of approximately two years  which represented our best estimates of the time period over which these securities would be redeemed 
however  as progressed  we determined that  based on the market conditions at the time that the estimated time horizon for redemption of such securities would be greater than two years and  in the fourth quarter of  we adjusted our assumptions for this consideration 
the total fair value of the auction rate securities at december   was million 
these securities are classified as long term assets  except for those that are scheduled to be redeemed within the next twelve months  which are classified as short term investments 
the impairment described above  as of year end  is classified as an other than temporary loss  separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors 
the amount representing the credit loss is recognized in earnings  and as long as we do not intend to sell the security or it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis  the remaining amount is recorded in other comprehensive income 
the amount recognized in earnings during the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
this is recorded in realized investment loss  net on our consolidated statement of operations 
the assumptions utilized in the valuation will continue to be reviewed and  as market conditions continue to evolve and change  we will adjust our assumptions accordingly  which could result in either positive or negative valuation adjustments in the future 
currently  we believe that we have the ability and intent to hold these securities until recovery 
we also do not believe that the illiquid nature of these securities will negatively impact our business  as we believe we have the ability to generate sufficient cash to fund the operations and future growth of the business absent these securities 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december  dollars in thousands payments due by period less than more than total year years years years operating leases capital lease inventory purchase obligation capital commitments pension and retiree health and life insurance benefits total anticipated payments for the capital lease include projected interest expense for purposes of this table 
pension benefit payments  which amount to million  are expected to be paid through the utilization of pension plan assets  retiree health and life insurance benefits  which amount to million  are expected to be paid from operating cash flows 
effects of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our business  sales  or operating results during the periods presented 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are in the opinion of management reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and believe that appropriate reserves have been established based on reasonable methodologies and appropriate assumptions based on facts and circumstances that are known  however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions that are highly judgmental and uncertain at the time the estimate is made  if different estimates could reasonably have been used or if changes to those estimates are reasonably likely to periodically occur that could affect the amounts carried in the financial statements 
these critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met we have entered into a binding agreement  the product has shipped and title has passed  the sales price to the customer is fixed or is determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue based upon a determination that all criteria for revenue recognition have been met  which  based on the majority of our shipping terms  is considered to have occurred upon shipment of the finished product 
some shipping terms require the goods to be through customs or be received by the customer before title passes 
in those instances  revenues are not recognized until either the customer has received the goods or they have passed through customs  depending on the circumstances 
as appropriate  we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer returns and allowances and warranty claims 
provisions for such allowances are made at the time of sale and are typically derived from historical trends and other relevant information 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is established to represent our best estimate of the net realizable value of the outstanding accounts receivable 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on a variety of factors that affect the potential collectability of receivables  including length of time receivables are past due  customer credit ratings  financial stability of customers  specific one time events and past customer history 
in addition  in circumstances when we are made aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific allowance is established 
the majority of accounts are individually evaluated on a regular basis and appropriate reserves are established as deemed appropriate based on the criteria previously mentioned 
the remainder of the reserve is based on our estimates and takes into consideration historical trends  market conditions and the composition of our customer base 
the risk with this estimate is associated with failure to become aware of potential collectability issues related to specific accounts and thereby become exposed to potential unreserved losses 
historically  our estimates and assumptions around the allowance have been reasonably accurate and we have processes and controls in place to closely monitor customers and potential credit issues  additionally  we have credit insurance which mitigates some of the risk of loss 
over the past three years  our allowance as a percentage of total receivables has ranged from to 
a increase in our current year allowance to receivable ratio would increase our allowance reserve by approximately million 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with costs determined primarily on a first in first out basis 
we also maintain a reserve for excess  obsolete and slow moving inventory  which is primarily developed by utilizing both specific product identification and historical product demand as the basis for our analysis 
products and materials that are specifically identified as obsolete are fully reserved 
in general  most products that have been held in inventory greater than one year are fully reserved unless there are mitigating circumstances  including forecasted sales or current orders for the product 
the remainder of the allowance is based on our estimates  and fluctuates with market conditions  design cycles and other economic factors 
risks associated with this allowance include unforeseen changes in business cycles that could affect the marketability of certain products and an unexpected decline in current production 
we closely monitor the market place and related inventory levels and have historically maintained reasonably accurate allowance levels 
in addition  we value certain inventories using the last in  first out lifo method 
accordingly  a lifo valuation reserve is calculated using the link chain index method and is maintained to properly value these inventories 
our obsolescence reserve has ranged from to of gross inventory over the last three years 
a adjustment to the december  obsolescence reserve would change the reserve by approximately million 
goodwill and other intangibles we have made acquisitions over the years that included the recognition of goodwill 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may have been impaired 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires significant judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is subjective and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including revenue growth rates and operating margins  discount rates  and future market conditions  among others 
we review goodwill for impairment using a two step process 
the first step of the impairment test requires a comparison of the implied fair value of each of our reporting units to the respective carrying value 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit is less than its implied fair value  no indication of impairment exists and a second step is not performed 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit is higher than its fair value  there is an indication that impairment may exist then a second step must be performed 
in the second step  the impairment is computed by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill  an impairment loss must be recognized for the excess and charged to operations 
in  we estimated the fair value of our reporting units using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows 
we believe this approach yields the most appropriate evidence of fair value as our reporting units are not easily compared to other corporations involved in similar businesses 
we further believe that the assumptions and rates used in our annual impairment test are reasonable  but inherently uncertain 
the impairment test was performed in the fourth quarter of on the three reporting units for which we had goodwill recorded at that time 
no impairment charges resulted from this analysis 
the excess of fair value over carrying value for these reporting units ranged from approximately million to million 
in order to estimate the sensitivity of the analysis performed  we applied a hypothetical decrease to the fair values of each operating segment  which resulted in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately million to million for each respective operating segment 
these valuations are based on a five year discounted cash flow analysis  which utilized a discount rate of approximately and a terminal year growth rate of intangible assets  such as purchased technology  customer relationships  work force  and the like  are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition 
values assigned to intangible assets are determined based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations of the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired  the value of the acquired businesses customer base  as well as the value of its existing work force  among others 
these assets are reviewed at least annually  or more frequently  if facts and circumstances surrounding such assets indicate a possible impairment of the asset exists 
in  there were no indicators of impairment on any of our other intangible assets 
long lived assets we review property  plant and equipment  intangible assets  and other long term assets including investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying value to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic lives 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their market value determined by either a quoted market price  if available  or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis 
in  we recorded impairment charges related to certain long lived assets in our printed circuit materials  custom electrical components and high performance foams operating segments 
see the results of operations section of item of this form k  for further discussion 
in the future  deterioration in our business could result in additional impairment charges 
evaluation of impairment of long lived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows 
actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our long lived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets 
these differences could result in impairment charges  which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
in addition  in certain instances  assets may not be impaired but their estimated useful lives may have decreased 
in these situations  we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised useful lives 
environmental contingencies we accrue for our environmental investigation  remediation  operating and maintenance costs when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
for environmental matters  the most likely cost to be incurred is accrued based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site  including existing technology  current laws and regulations and prior remediation experience 
for sites with multiple potential responsible parties prps  we consider our likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation costs and the ability of the other parties to fulfill their obligations in establishing a provision for those costs 
where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely to occur than another  the minimum is accrued 
when future liabilities are determined to be reimbursable by insurance coverage  an accrual is recorded for the potential liability and a receivable is recorded for the estimated insurance reimbursement amount 
we are exposed to the uncertain nature inherent in such remediation and the possibility that initial estimates will not reflect the final outcome of a matter 
product liability and workers compensation costs workers compensation liabilities in the us are recognized for claims incurred including claims incurred but not reported and for changes in the status of individual case reserves 
at the time a workers compensation claim is filed  a liability is estimated to settle the claim 
the liability for workers compensation claims is determined based on estimates of the nature and severity of the claims and based on analysis provided by third party administrators and by various state statutes and reserve requirements 
we have developed our own trend factors based on our specific claims experience 
in other countries where workers compensation claims are applicable  we typically maintain insurance coverage with limited deductible payments 
because the liability is an estimate  the ultimate liability may be more or less than reported 
for product liability claims  we typically maintain insurance coverage with reasonable deductible levels to protect us from potential exposures 
any liability associated with such claims is based on management s best estimate of the potential claim value  while insurance receivables associated with related claims are not recorded until verified by the insurance carrier 
related to our asbestos exposures  in late  we determined that it was reasonably prudent  based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time  to perform a formal analysis to determine our potential future liability and related insurance coverage for asbestos related matters 
the determination to perform this study was made based on several factors  including the growing number of asbestos related claims and recent settlement history 
projecting future asbestos costs is subject to numerous variables that are extremely difficult to predict  including the number of claims that might be received  the type and severity of the disease alleged by each claimant  the long latency period associated with asbestos exposure  dismissal rates  costs of medical treatment  the financial resources of other companies that are co defendants in claims  uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case  and the impact of potential changes in legislative or judicial standards  including potential tort reform 
furthermore  any predictions with respect to these variables are subject to even greater uncertainty as the projection period lengthens 
in light of these inherent uncertainties  the variability of our claims history and consultations with national economic research associates  inc nera  we believe that five years is the most reasonable period for recognizing a reserve for future costs  and that costs that might be incurred after that period are not reasonably estimable at this time 
as a result  we also believe that our ultimate net asbestos related contingent liability ie  its indemnity or other claim disposition costs plus related legal fees cannot be estimated with certainty 
the models developed for determining the potential exposure and related insurance coverage were developed by outside consultants deemed to be experts in their respective fields 
the models required us to make numerous assumptions that significantly impacted the results generated by the models 
we believe the assumptions made are reasonable at the present time  but are subject to uncertainty based on the actual future outcome of our asbestos litigation 
we believe  based on the limited amount of settlement and claims history currently known to us  that a reasonable future time frame to quantify our liability is five years  resulting in a liability at december  of approximately million  which is substantially offset by an insurance receivable of million 
if we were to adjust our assumptions related to the determination of these amounts  the impact of increasing the time frame for projected claims from five years to seven years would be an increase to the liability of million  which we believe would be substantially covered by insurance  conversely  the impact of changing this assumption from five years to three years would be a decrease to the liability of million 
given the inherent uncertainty in making future projections  we plan to have the projections of current and future asbestos claims periodically re examined  and we will update them further if needed based on our experience  changes in the underlying assumptions that formed the basis for nera s and marsh risk consulting s marsh models  and other relevant factors  such as changes in the tort system 
there can be no assurance that our accrued asbestos liabilities will approximate our actual asbestos related settlement and defense costs  or that our accrued insurance recoveries will be realized 
we believe that it is reasonably possible that we will incur additional charges for our asbestos liabilities and defense costs in the future  which could exceed existing reserves  but cannot reasonably estimate such excess amounts at this time 
legal contingencies from time to time we are a defendant in legal matters  including those involving environmental law and product liability as discussed in more detail above 
as required by us gaap  we determine whether an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and the loss amount can be reasonably estimated 
separately  we would analyze any potential insurance proceeds that would be available to us to offset the claim amounts 
estimates of potential outcomes of these contingencies are developed in consultation with internal and external counsel 
while this assessment is based upon all available information  litigation is inherently uncertain and the ultimate outcome of such litigation could be more or less than original estimates 
final resolution of such matters could possibly result in significant effect on our results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
pension and other postretirement benefits we provide various defined benefit pension plans for our us employees and sponsor three defined benefit healthcare plans and a life insurance plan 
the costs and obligations associated with these plans are dependent upon various actuarial assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include discount rates  salary growth  long term rate of return on plan assets  mortality rates and other factors 
the assumptions used were determined as follows i the discount rate used is based on comparisons to various indexes  particularly the citigroup bond index  ii the salary growth is based on our historical and projected level of salary increases  and iii the long term rate of return on plan assets is determined based on historical portfolio results  market conditions and our expectations of future returns 
we determine these assumptions based on consultation with outside actuaries and investment advisors 
any variance in these assumptions could have a significant impact on future recognized pension costs  assets and liabilities 
the rates used to determine our costs and obligations under our pension and postretirement plans are disclosed in note of the consolidated financial statements of this form k 
each assumption has different sensitivity characteristics 
for the year ended december   a decrease in the discount rate would have increased our net benefit cost by approximately million and a basis point reduction in the long term rate of return on plan assets would have increased our net benefit cost by approximately million 
income taxes the objective of accounting for income taxes is to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current fiscal year and the deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements 
deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect temporary differences between amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting 
such amounts are adjusted  as appropriate  to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse 
we establish a valuation allowance to offset any deferred tax assets if  based upon the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the determination of the amount of a valuation allowance to be provided on recorded deferred tax assets involves estimates regarding the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences  expected future taxable income  and the impact of tax planning strategies 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including past operating results  projections of future taxable income and the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies 
the projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our volume  pricing and costs 
additionally  valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws 
significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions 
we establish additional provisions for income taxes when  despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable  there remain certain positions that are likely to be challenged and that may not be sustained on review by tax authorities 
in the normal course of business  we are examined by various federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
we continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision  the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known 
it is our policy that no us taxes are provided on undistributed earnings of certain wholly owned foreign subsidiaries because substantially all such earnings are expected to be reinvested indefinitely 
we do provide deferred taxes for the undistributed earnings of our japanese high performance foams joint venture  and we did provide deferred taxes on our taiwanese flexible circuit materials joint venture  until it was sold in october stock based compensation stock based compensation expense associated with stock options and related awards are recognized in the statement of income 
determining the amount of stock based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant date fair value of stock options 
we calculate the grant date fair values using the black scholes valuation model 
the use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions expected volatility in determining expected volatility  we have considered a number of factors  including historical volatility and implied volatility 
expected term we use historical employee exercise data to estimate the expected term assumption for the black scholes valuation 
risk free interest rate we use the yield on zero coupon us treasury securities for a period commensurate with the expected term assumption as its risk free interest rate 
expected dividend yield we currently do not pay dividends on our common stock  therefore  a dividend yield of was used in the black scholes model 
the amount of stock based compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the term forfeitures is distinct from cancellations or expirations and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option 
based on an analysis of our historical forfeitures  we have applied an annual forfeiture rate of to all unvested stock based awards as of december  the rate of represents the portion that is expected to be forfeited each year over the vesting period 
this analysis is re evaluated annually and the forfeiture rate is adjusted as necessary 
ultimately  the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk foreign operations our financial results are affected by changes in foreign exchange rates and economic conditions in foreign countries in which we do business 
our primary overseas markets are in europe and asia  thus exposing us to exchange rate risk from fluctuations in the euro and the various currencies used in the far east 
exposure to variability in currency exchange rates is mitigated  when possible  through the use of natural hedges  whereby purchases and sales in the same foreign currency and with similar maturity dates offset one another 
we initiate hedging activities by entering into foreign exchange forward contracts with third parties when the use of natural hedges is not possible or desirable 
in  a increase decrease in exchange rates would have resulted in an approximate increase decrease to sales and net income of million and million  respectively 
we currently do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we monitor foreign exchange risks and at times manage such risks on specific transactions 
our risk management process primarily uses analytical techniques and sensitivity analysis 
interest rate risk during the first quarter of  we borrowed million against our existing credit facilities to finance the strategic acquisition of curamik electronics gmbh 
therefore  we are exposed to interest rate risk  as the interest charged on our facility fluctuates based on market conditions 
based on our current outstanding debt of million  a increase in the interest rate would increase the amount of interest expense by million  annually 
auction rate securities we currently hold auction rate securities with a par value of million 
due to the liquidity issues experienced in the auction rate market during the recession of  these securities do not trade on an open market 
we are forced to either hold these securities to maturity  which range from to years  wait for the issuer to redeem these securities at par value  or accept offers to repurchase these securities for a discount 
due to market conditions  these securities may not become liquid for an extended period of time 
the changes in market conditions caused us to change the nature of these investments and record an impairment during the first quarter of and each subsequent quarter through at year end  this impairment is classified as a other than temporary loss  separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors 
the amount representing the credit loss is recognized in earnings  and  as long as we do not intend to sell the security or it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis  the remaining impairment amount is recorded in other comprehensive income 
additionaly  due to our current liquidity and intent to hold the investments until they recover the amount of the impairment not related to credit loss is recorded in other comprehensive income 
the fair value of our investment portfolio or the related interest income would not be significantly impacted by either a increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the size and nature of our investment portfolio 
commodity risk we are subject to fluctuations in the cost of raw materials used to manufacture our materials and products 
in particular  we are exposed to market fluctuations in commodity pricing as we utilize certain materials  such as copper and ceramic  that are key materials in certain of our products 
in order to minimize the risk of market driven price changes in these commodities  we utilize hedging strategies to insulate us against price fluctuations of copper  the commodity most used in our manufacturing processes 
we currently do not use hedging strategies to minimize the risk of price fluctuations on other commodity based raw materials  however  we continue to review such strategies to hedge market risk in the future 
for additional discussion on our market risk  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k
