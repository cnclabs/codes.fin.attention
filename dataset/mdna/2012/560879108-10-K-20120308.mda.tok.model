item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are an emerging medical device company that markets our advanced robotic arm solution and orthopedic implants for orthopedic procedures 
we offer makoplasty  an innovative  restorative surgical solution that enables orthopedic surgeons to consistently  reproducibly and precisely treat patient specific osteoarthritic disease 
our common stock trades on the nasdaq global select market under the ticker symbol mako 
we have incurred net losses in each year since our inception and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to continue to incur significant operating losses as we increase our sales and marketing activities and otherwise continue to invest capital in the development and expansion of our products and our business generally 
we expect that our general and administrative expenses will continue to increase to support the sales and marketing efforts associated with the growing commercialization of makoplasty  including our makoplasty total hip arthroplasty application  or makoplasty tha application  that we commercially launched in september  and to support our continued growth in operations 
we also expect our research and development expenses to increase as we continue to expand our research and development activities  including the support of existing products and the research of potential future products 
recent business events and key milestones in the development of our business include the following in september  we announced the commercial availability of the rio system for use in total hip replacement procedures  called the makoplasty tha application 
a total of makoplasty tha applications were sold in  resulting in of our domestic commercial installed base having the makoplasty tha application as of december  during the year ended december   we sold rio systems  including domestic commercial sales  two international commercial sales and two international demonstration sales  increasing our worldwide commercial installed base to systems 
a total of  makoplasty procedures were performed worldwide during the year ended december  representing a increase over the same period in in the third quarter of  we received notification from the us patent and trademark office of the allowance of our makoplasty patent application  entitled haptic guidance system and method  which claims what we believe are fundamental elements of any viable robotic solution for orthopedic surgery 
additionally  we expanded the scope of our existing worldwide license to the entire patent portfolio of immersion corporation to provide mako with exclusive rights in the field of robotic orthopedics 
we believe that the keys to continuing to grow our business are expanding the acceptance and application of makoplasty for partial knee resurfacing procedures  gaining market acceptance for our makoplasty tha application and associated implant systems and introducing other potential future applications 
to successfully commercialize our products and continue to grow our business  we must gain broad market acceptance for makoplasty procedures 

table of contents factors that may influence future results of operations the following is a description of factors that may influence our future results of operations  including significant trends and challenges that we believe are important to an understanding of our business and results of operations 
revenue revenue is generated from rio system sales and applications sales of implants and disposable products utilized in makoplasty procedures  and sales of warranty and maintenance services on the rio system hardware 
future revenue from sales of our products is difficult to predict and we expect that it will only modestly reduce our continuing losses resulting from selling  general and administrative expenses  research and development expenses and other activities for at least the next two years 
our future revenue may also be adversely affected by the current general economic conditions and the resulting tightening of the credit markets  which may cause purchasing decisions to be delayed or cause our customers to experience difficulties in securing adequate funding to buy our products 
the generation of recurring revenue through sales of our implants  disposable products and warranty service contracts is an important part of the makoplasty business model 
we anticipate that recurring revenue will constitute an increasing percentage of our total revenue as we leverage each new installation of our rio system to generate recurring sales of implants and disposable products and as we expand our rio applications and implant product offerings  including our makoplasty tha application that we commercially launched in september during the fourth quarter of  we determined that we had incorrectly recognized revenue and expenses associated with the initial warranty obligation and maintenance services included in all previous rio system sales 
accordingly  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an adjustment to decrease revenue by million  to reverse the accrual for our warranty and maintenance obligation by  and to increase net loss by  or per basic and diluted share 
the adjustment arose over the quarters throughout and and did not materially affect our trend in earnings 
as the adjustment was related to the correction of an error  we performed the analysis required by staff accounting bulletin  materiality  and staff accounting bulletin  considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
based on this analysis  we concluded that the effect of the error was not material to the quarters and years in the two year period ended december  from both a quantitative and qualitative perspective 
cost of revenue cost of revenue primarily consists of the direct costs associated with the manufacture of rio systems  implants and disposable products for which revenue has been recognized in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 
costs associated with providing services are expensed as incurred 
cost of revenue also includes the allocation of manufacturing overhead costs  freight  royalties related to the sale of products covered by licensing arrangements and write offs of obsolete  impaired or excess inventory 
selling  general and administrative expenses our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation  including stock based compensation and benefits  for sales  marketing  training  clinical research  operations  regulatory  quality  finance  legal  executive  and administrative personnel 
other significant expenses include costs associated with sales and marketing activities  marketing and advertising materials  training  insurance  professional fees for legal and accounting services  consulting fees  travel expenses  facility and related operating costs  depreciation on loaned implant instrumentation to customers  and recruiting and other human resources expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses are expected to continue to increase due to the planned increase in the number of employees necessary to support the sales and marketing efforts associated with the growing 
table of contents commercialization of makoplasty and an increased number of employees necessary to support our continued growth in operations 
in addition  we expect to incur additional costs associated with securing and protecting our intellectual property rights as necessary to support our current and future product offerings 
research and development expenses costs related to research  design and development of products are charged to research and development expense as incurred 
these costs include direct salary and benefit costs for research and development employees including stock based compensation  cost for materials used in research and development activities and costs for outside services 
we expect our research and development expense to increase as we continue to expand our research and development activities  including the support of existing products and the research and development of potential future products 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported expenses during the reporting periods 
the accounting estimates that require our most significant  difficult and subjective judgments include revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets  impairment of long lived assets and the determination of stock based compensation 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions
