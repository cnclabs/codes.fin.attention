item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cautionary statement the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes hereto 
management overview results and priorities in  onvia delivered record profitability despite declining revenue growth 
for the full year  onvia delivered record adjusted ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  including non cash stock based compensation of million up over and exceeded our target of million set at the beginning of annual net income was million or per diluted share for the year ended december  compared to net loss of  or cents per diluted share in due to our improving profitability we released  of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets which resulted in the same amount being recognized as a tax benefit in our fourth quarter net income 
we will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the valuation allowance annually at a minimum  but more frequently based on consideration of our operating results 
excluding the effects of the valuation allowance  we had million of deferred tax assets related to million in net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable net income at december  consistent with our expectations  annual revenue declined by to million from million in in sequential quarters  our declining revenue growth slowed to in the fourth quarter of compared to a decline in the third quarter 
we expect sequential quarterly revenues to stabilize in the first quarter of  but we expect year over year growth rates will remain negative through the first half of compared to annual contract value  or acv  represents the aggregate annual value of our subscription contracts 
acv declined by to million from million a year ago  but the rate of decline slowed compared to sequential quarters 
in the fourth quarter  acv declined by compared to a sequential quarter decline of in the third quarter of stabilization of acv indicates that client retention rates are improving and new client acquisitions are beginning to scale 
acv is expected to stabilize in early in onvia s total client base decreased to  clients at december  compared to  clients at december  in the fourth quarter  however  we lost clients at a much slower rate than in previous quarters  losing of our base  compared to and of the base in the second and third quarters of  respectively 
annual contract value per client  however  increased from q to an average of nearly  per client 
acvc improved  in part by targeting more strategic clients and because renewals were weighted toward strategic clients with higher contract values 
in  operating expenses decreased to million compared to million in  excluding the prior year impairment of capitalized software in the amount of  we realized a full year of expense savings from programs initiated in mid  and we continued to manage expenses and reallocate resources to high margin initiatives over the course of at december   cash  cash equivalents and investments increased by  despite declining revenues  compared to the end of as of december  we held cash and investments of million compared to million at the end of last year 
our cash balance increased due to lower operating expenses and capital expenditures  and improving acv 
in  onvia began to transform the company to a business model that delivers the high  differentiated value of a rich public sector procurement database 
the powerful public procurement database will include proprietary content and analytical tools that deliver essential insight and intelligence required by the market to effectively do business with state and local governments 
onvia now targets a well defined market of companies that have a long term strategic interest in the public sector  and the government market is an essential part of their dna 
all three of our sales channels  small medium business  enterprise  and channel  focus on this market 
the high margins of this model provide the flexibility to price products based upon the value that we create for clients  not based upon the cost of fulfillment 
we focused on five key priorities in  three of which were successful we developed a three year product roadmap based upon client feedback and placed additional focus on content coverage  accuracy and timeliness 
we improved the usability and findability features of our database with the launch of onvia in february our small and medium business or smb sales organization was transformed from a telemarketing transactional model to a professional consultative selling organization 
while this team is still a work in process  average contract value for new clients was approximately  in  compared to approximately  in  an increase of 
on the account management side  client retention rates increased over percentage points since the first quarter of we expect to begin to realize the full impact of these changes in and beyond as our clients progress through the term of their annual subscription 
our leadership team improved our management of expenses 
we made difficult decisions to more efficiently allocate capital to achieve a higher rate of return and provide greater focus and clarity 
overall expenses were reduced by  excluding the software write off of  in two of our initiatives were not as successful as planned new client acquisitions by the enterprise sales team did not scale as quickly as planned 
our content license initiative did not realize some of the opportunities we expected 
we continue to test different partnership models to identify those markets with the greatest potential 
we believe this will be a profitable sales channel for onvia in and beyond 
in we will continue our transformation to a database and analytics driven business 
the second year of our transition has four initiatives we plan to continue to drive improvement in our smb sales organization to scale results 
in  we will emphasize domain knowledge expertise with the vertical alignment of both acquisition and retention teams  and focus on consultative selling to align onvia s solutions to client needs  objectives and challenges 
we plan to add more structure to our enterprise sales organization 
we will roll out the successful methods that were executed in smb to the enterprise team  such as vertical industry specialization  consultative selling and a rigorous customer care program 
since the smb and enterprise selling processes are very similar  we will measure the success of new client acquisition efforts by reporting a blended acvc for both smb and enterprise sales in we plan to execute our product roadmap 
throughout the year we plan to capture additional content and normalize and enhance our data to be in a position to deliver several compelling strategic analytical applications to our clients in we need to improve our marketing 
we plan to create a strong strategic message that conveys not who we are today but who we will be years from now 
we will deliver this message consistently and clearly across all of our communication channels to drive revenue growth  improve sales effectiveness and build our brand 
this plan is designed to build a profitable and sustainable business model to drive stockholder value and client satisfaction 
application of critical accounting policies and management estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of commitments and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ significantly from our estimates 
in addition  any significant unanticipated changes in any of our assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we believe the following are our most significant accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition our revenues are primarily generated from subscriptions  content licenses and management reports 
our subscriptions are generally annual contracts  however  we also offer extended multi year contracts to our subscription clients  and content licenses are generally multi year agreements 
subscription and content licenses are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
we also generate revenue from fees charged for management reports  document download services  and list rental services  and revenue from these types of services is recognized upon delivery  or  if report refreshes are included  ratably over the service period 
our subscription services and management information reports are also sold together as a bundled offering 
pursuant to the provisions of accounting standard codification  or asc  revenue recognition  we allocate revenue from these bundled sales ratably between the subscription services and the management reports based on their relative fair values  which are consistent with established list prices for those offerings 
in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update  or asu  no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
this asu amends the criteria for separating deliverables  and measuring and allocating arrangement consideration to one or more units of accounting 
the amendments also establish a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
we have adopted the amendments in this asu for arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after january  we do not believe adoption materially impacted reported revenue 
unearned revenue consists of payments received for prepaid subscriptions  as well as the invoiced  but unpaid  portion of subscriptions and content licenses whose terms extend into periods beyond the balance sheet date 
internal use software we account for the costs to develop or obtain software for internal use in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other subtopic internal use software 
as a result  we capitalize qualifying computer software costs incurred during the application development stage 
amortization of these costs begins once the product is ready for its intended use 
these capitalized software costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the product  typically to years 
the amount of costs capitalized within any period is dependent on the nature of software development activities and projects in each period 
during the first quarter of  assets that were nearly fully amortized related to aging search technology were replaced with a new platform 
onvia recorded an immaterial loss on this abandonment in operating expenses under the general and administrative category in the twelve months ended december  during the second quarter of  onvia abandoned its onvia planning and construction product 
pursuant with the guidance in asc  onvia recorded a loss on abandonment of approximately  representing the full unamortized balance as of september for these three assets 
the loss is included in operating expenses under the general and administrative category in the twelve months ended december  stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation according to the provisions of asc compensation stock compensation  which requires measurement of compensation cost for all stock based awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognition of stock based compensation cost over the requisite service period for awards expected to vest 
the fair value of our stock options is determined using the black scholes valuation model 
such value is recognized as expense over the service period  net of estimated forfeitures 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures  including employee class and historical experience 
there is also significant judgment required in the estimation of the valuation assumptions used to determine the fair value of options granted 
please refer to the discussion of valuation assumptions in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this report for additional information on the estimation of these variables 
actual results  and future changes in estimates  may differ substantially from our current estimates 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts we record accounts receivable for the invoiced portion of our contracts once we have a signed agreement and amounts are billable under the contract 
all of our subscription contracts are non cancellable upon activation 
we do not record an asset for the unbilled or unearned portion of our contracts 
accounts receivable are recorded at their net realizable value  after deducting an allowance for doubtful accounts 
such allowances are determined based on a review of an aging of accounts and reflect either specific accounts or estimates based on historical incurred losses 
if the financial condition of our clients were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required  and our ability to recognize sales to certain clients may be affected 
non gaap financial measures we prepare and publicly release quarterly financial statements prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the non gaap financial measures we may disclose include adjusted ebitda and client metrics such as acv  acvc and qcvc 
for a discussion regarding our client metrics  please refer the clients section of item business 
we typically disclose adjusted ebitda measures in our earnings releases  investor conference calls and filings with security and exchange commission 
adjusted ebitda is not a financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income  operating income or any other financial measures so calculated and presented  nor as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of the company s liquidity 
we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss before interest expense and other non cash financing costs  taxes  depreciation  amortization  and non cash stock based compensation 
other companies including our competitors may define adjusted ebitda differently 
we present adjusted ebitda because we believe adjusted ebitda to be an important supplemental measure of performance that is commonly used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in similar industries and size 
management also uses this information internally for forecasting and budgeting 
it may not be indicative of our historical operating results nor is it intended to be predictive of potential future results 
investors should not consider adjusted ebitda in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of results as reported under gaap 
the following table provides reconciliation of gaap net income loss to adjusted ebitda for the indicated periods in thousands year ended december  gaap net income loss reconciling items from gaap to adjusted ebitda interest and other income  net depreciation and amortization amortization of stock based compensation income tax benefit adjusted ebitda consolidated results of operations the following table provides our selected consolidated results of operations for the indicated periods in thousands of dollars and as a percentage of total revenue years ended december  revenue subscription content license management information reports other total revenue cost of revenue gross margin operating expenses sales and marketing expenses technology and development expenses general and administrative expenses total operating expenses income loss from operations interest and other income  net income loss before income tax benefit for income taxes net income loss comparison of years ended december  and revenue revenue decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  as part of its turn around plan  onvia is now focused on a small  targeted market of prospects which are committed long term to the public sector 
under the previous transactional business model  out target market was extremely broad  and we acquired a large number non strategic clients which were not adequately profitable 
we no longer invest in acquiring non strategic clients  and our client base has declined as expected as we transition to our more profitable target market 
our declining year over year revenue is directly attributable to this planned decline in non strategic clients 
cost of revenue cost of revenues for the twelve months ended december  and were as follows in thousands increase decrease amount percent twelve months ended december  percentage of revenue our cost of revenue primarily represents payroll related expenses associated with the capture  research and categorization of the data in our proprietary database and third party content fees  and also includes credit card processing fees 
the decrease for the comparable periods was primarily related to decrease in the third party content costs due to a strategic change in our production model 
weighted average headcount in our content team was during  compared to in headcount decreased as a result of higher utilization of third party content aggregators 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses for the twelve months ended december  and were as follows in thousands increase decrease amount percent twelve months ended december  percentage of revenue the decrease in expenses for the comparable periods is primarily comprised of million in payroll related expenses due to decreased headcount and lower commissionable sales   in reduced marketing spending on our smaller  more targeted market   in severance due to the departure of our senior vice president of sales and chief solution officer in  and  in travel and entertainment due to decreased travel to enterprise clients 
weighted average headcount in our sales and marketing teams was during the twelve months ended december   compared to in the same period in technology and development technology and development expenses for the twelve months ended december  and were as follows in thousands increase decrease amount percent twelve months ended december  percentage of revenue the increase in expenses for the comparable periods is primarily attributed to a  decrease in capitalized internal use software costs primarily salaries and benefits attributable to the nature of development efforts during the year 
a smaller percentage of development efforts in were capitalizable pursuant to asc  intangibles goodwill and other subtopic internal use software 
this change was offset by a  decrease in payroll related expenses due to lower headcount and lower benefits and  decrease in facilities costs mostly due to leveraging more competitively priced vendors 
weighted average headcount in our technology and development teams was during the year of  compared to in general and administrative general and administrative expenses for the twelve months ended december  and were as follows in thousands increase decrease amount percent twelve months ended december  percentage of revenue the decrease in expenses for the comparable periods is primarily related to a  abandonment of internal use software in the second quarter of  a  decrease in severance expenses primarily related to our former chief executive officer s transition agreement and separation agreements for our former senior vp of technology  production and information  a  decrease in contract labor and consultant expenses in part due to fees related to the ceo search and reduced public relations costs  and a  decrease in payroll related expenses due to lower headcount 
these decreases were offset by an increase of  in stock compensation expenses due to forfeitures in related to the departure of our two executives 
weighted average headcount in this group was and in the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
other income  net other income  net consists of interest earned on our investment accounts  interest expense associated with capital leases and other miscellaneous income or expense 
other income  net was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
provision for income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and nol carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
a valuation allowance has been established for the majority of the net deferred tax assets as we have determined that the recognition criteria for realization have not been met 
our valuation allowance reduces our deferred tax assets to a level that is more than likely than not to be recognized 
in determining the amount of the valuation allowance we consider whether it is more likely that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are expected to be deductible 
we will continue to review the estimate of future taxable income and will adjust the valuation allowance accordingly as new information becomes available 
utilization of the nol carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to an ownership change that could occur in the future provided by section of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
these ownership changes may limit the amount of nol carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income and tax  respectively 
in general  an ownership change  as defined by section of the code  results from transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders or public groups in the stock of a corporation by more than percentage points over a three year period 
we performed a section analysis and identified an ownership change that occurred in september we believe that  as a result of the annual section limitation that resulted from the change in control that occurred in september  we permanently will be unable to use a significant portion of our nol carryforward that arose before the change in control to offset our future taxable income 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
our combined cash and cash equivalents and short term investments were million at december   and our working capital was million 
from december  to december   our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased by million for the reasons described below under operating  investing and financing activities 
in may  michael pickett  our former chief executive officer  president and chairman of the board  exercised  options 
mr 
pickett surrendered  shares subject to the options to satisfy the exercise price of the options and the tax withholding obligations resulting from the exercise 
the tax obligation associated with this exercise was approximately  and we settled this obligation in may this payment is presented under financing activities on the statement of cash flows 
pursuant to mr 
pickett s transition agreement  we made a transition payment of  on march  in october   eric t 
gillespie  our former senior vice president  products  technology and information  resigned 
pursuant to mr 
gillespie s separation and release agreement  we made payments totaling  for severance and accrued but unused vacation in november in november   michael s 
balsam announced his resignation as chief strategy officer of onvia  effective december  pursuant to mr 
balsam s transition services agreement he was entitled to a transition payment and accrued but unused vacation totaling  which was paid on december   subject to all required or agreed upon deductions and withholdings 
if we engage in merger or acquisition transactions or our overall operating plans change  we may require additional equity or debt financing to meet future working capital needs  which may have a dilutive effect on existing stockholders or may include securities that have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the rights of our common stock 
we cannot make assurances that if additional financing is required  it will be available  or that such financing can be obtained on satisfactory terms 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in operating cash flow is primarily due a reduction in operating expenses that exceeded the reduction in sales 
investing activities net cash used by investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to net cash provided by investing activities of million for the year ended december  we purchased million in short term investments during the twelve months of compared to million in short term investments and  in long term investments for the same period of during the twelve months of we received million from the sale and maturity of investments  compared to million during the same period of purchases of property and equipment and investments in our technology platform decreased by million in the twelve months of compared to the same period in in addition   of our security deposit on the lease for our corporate headquarters was returned to us in both march and march financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was  for the year ended december  compared to net cash used in financing activities of  for the year ended december  the increase in cash used is primarily due to tax obligations associated with mr
