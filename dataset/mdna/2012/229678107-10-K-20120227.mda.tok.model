overview cubist s strategic intent is to become the leading global biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering  developing  and commercializing therapies for acutely ill patients 
guided by this intent  we are pursuing three complementary paths to growing long term value for our shareholders optimizing cubicin our iv antibiotic  cubicin  continues to be the foundation of our business 
the cash flow generated from the sale and use of this product for the treatment of patients with certain serious infections caused by gram positive bacteria  including mrsa  funds important investments to drive our future growth 
in addition  we are building today on the scientific  medical  commercial and operational expertise we have gained as cubicin was developed and commercialized 
in  we secured this important foundation with the settlement of our patent litigation with teva 
as a result of this agreement we anticipate an exclusivity period for cubicin until either late december or late june in addition  as a result of the supply arrangement with teva  we have added an anticipated multi year revenue stream from our share of teva s future gross margin from 
table of contents the sales of a generic daptomycin 
also in  we added to the cubicin patent portfolio 
based on our current orange book listed patents  our supply arrangement with teva is expected to extend until september in february  we received notification from hospira that it has submitted an anda to the fda for approval to market a generic version of cubicin before the expiration of the orange book patents covering cubicin 
we are confident in our intellectual property portfolio protecting cubicin  including the patents listed in the orange book 
cubicin s revenue growth in the us in keeps us on track toward our stated goal of achieving at least billion in peak year net cubicin revenues in the us alone 
outside of the us  cubicin was approved and launched in another significant market in japan 
cubicin is now available for the treatment of seriously ill patients in markets around the world 
revenues to cubist from sales of cubicin to our international partners were up in advancing our late stage clinical pipeline as we entered  we had phase clinical trials nearing completion for two programs first  cxa an iv antibiotic in development as treatment for serious infections caused by certain gram negative pathogens  second  cb an oral antibiotic drug candidate discovered internally by cubist  which is in development for the treatment of cdad 
we reported positive phase results in june of for both cxa and cb later in  we initiated phase clinical trials of cxa for the potential treatment of cuti and ciai 
additionally  we expect to initiate phase trials for cb and cxa for the potential treatment of habp and vabp in pursuing business development opportunities the teva settlement in april created important momentum for our business development activities 
our focus for the past year has been on executing business agreements that leverage our existing us acute care infrastructure and that are financially disciplined 
our first business development deal in was the two year agreement reached with optimer to help commercialize their cdad therapy  dificid  in us hospitals 
we have been earning service revenues under this agreement since july later in  we acquired adolor 
through this acquisition  we gained rights to an existing hospital based therapy  entereg  for which we can immediately leverage our us acute care commercial infrastructure  as well as a clinical candidate  cb  which we plan to advance into phase clinical trials in entereg is now being supported by our us sales and medical affairs organizations 
we are assessing opportunities for finding a partner for cb financial highlights the following table sets forth our total net revenues  net income and net income per share for the periods presented for the years ended december  in millions  except per share data total revenues  net net income basic net income per common share diluted net income per common share during the year ended december   we recognized million of contingent consideration expense primarily related to increasing the fair value of our contingent

the following is a breakdown of our product revenues for the years ended december  in millions us cubicin revenues  net us entereg revenues  net international product revenues total worldwide product revenues  net we derive substantially all of our revenues from cubicin  which we currently commercialize on our own in the us our worldwide net product revenues represent net us product revenues of cubicin and  beginning in december  entereg  as well as international product revenues  which relate to the payments we receive from international distributors in connection with their commercialization of cubicin 
international product revenues are primarily based on sales of cubicin by novartis  our distribution partner in the eu 
we expect both net revenues from sales of cubicin in the us and our revenues from cubicin sales outside the us to continue to increase due primarily to increased vial sales  market penetration into the mrsa market and price increases we may implement 
we also expect an increase in net product revenues as a result of the addition of entereg to our product portfolio and the recognition of a full year of revenue from sales of entereg in there are a number of events  trends and uncertainties that are impacting or may impact our revenues from cubicin and entereg and the growth of such revenues 
these events  trends and uncertainties are set forth in the risk factors section in item a of part i to this annual report on form k 
as noted above  in february  we received a paragraph iv certification notice letter from hospira notifying us that it has submitted an anda to the fda seeking approval to market a generic version of cubicin 
hospira s notice letter advised that it is seeking fda approval to market daptomycin for injection prior to the expiration of each of the orange book patents which protect cubicin 
the patents expire between june and september the notice letter further stated that hospira is asserting that claims in the referenced patents are invalid  and or not infringed  and or unenforceable 
we plan to file a patent infringement lawsuit against hospira in response to the anda filing 
by statute  if we initiate such a lawsuit within days of receiving the notice letter  the fda would be automatically precluded from approving hospira s anda for months or such shorter or longer period as ordered by the court because either party failed to expedite the lawsuit  or until a district court decision finding the patents invalid or not infringed  whichever occurs earlier 
once the lawsuit is filed  the month stay period will begin as of the date we were notified of the filing

acquisition of adolor in december  we completed our acquisition of adolor 
under the terms of the agreement and plan of merger  we paid adolor shareholders in cash for each share of adolor common stock  or approximately million  in aggregate  which we funded from our existing cash balances 
adolor s former shareholders also received one non transferable cpr  which represents the right to receive up to an additional for each share of adolor common stock owned  or up to approximately million in aggregate  which cubist will pay upon achievement of certain

co promotion agreement with optimer in april  we entered into a co promotion agreement with optimer in which optimer engaged cubist as its exclusive partner for the promotion of dificid in the us dificid was approved by the fda in may for the treatment of cdad 
under the terms of the co promotion agreement  optimer and cubist will co promote dificid to physicians  hospitals  long term care facilities and other health care institutions as well as jointly provide medical affairs support for dificid 
the co promotion agreement also provides that cubist is entitled to a quarterly fee of million  or an aggregate of million during the term of the co promotion agreement  and is also eligible to receive an additional million in the first year after first commercial sale and million in the second year after first commercial sale if mutually agreed upon annual sales targets are achieved  as well as of optimer s gross profits derived from net sales of dificid above the specified annual targets  if any

table of contents product revenues  net cubist s total net product revenues included million of sales of cubicin in the us  million of sales of entereg in the us and million of international product revenues for the year ended december   as compared to million of net us product revenues from sales of cubicin in the us and million of international product revenues for the year ended december  gross us product revenues totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the million increase in gross us product revenues was primarily due to price increases for cubicin in january and july  which resulted in million of additional gross cubicin us product revenues and to an increase of approximately in vial sales of cubicin in the us  which resulted in higher gross cubicin us product revenues of million 
gross us product revenues are offset by provisions for the years ended december  and  as follows for the years ended december  change in millions gross us product revenues provisions offsetting us product revenues contractual adjustments governmental rebates total provisions offsetting product revenues us product revenues  net contractual adjustments include pricing and early payment discounts extended to our external customers  as well as sales returns and wholesaler distribution fees 
governmental rebates represent estimated amounts for medicaid and medicare coverage gap discount programs  as well as chargebacks related to b phs and fss drug pricing programs 
the increase in provisions against gross product revenue was primarily driven by increases in chargebacks  medicaid rebates and pricing discounts due to increased us sales of cubicin and the price increases described above 
in addition  medicaid rebates also increased as a result of health care reform  which increased the amount of medicaid rebates and the number of individuals eligible to participate in the medicaid program 
international product revenues increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december   primarily related to amounts due to us from novartis for selling cubicin 
we expect international product revenues to increase in as a result of an increase in anticipated sales of cubicin by our international alliance partners 
service revenues service revenues for the years ended december  and  were million and million  respectively 
service revenues for the year ended december   related to quarterly fees earned under the co promotion agreement with optimer to promote dificid in the us service revenues for the year ended december   related to our exclusive agreement with astrazeneca to promote and provide other support in the us for merrem iv the merrem iv agreement  as amended  expired in accordance with its terms at the end of june we expect service revenues to increase in as compared to as a result of a full year of receiving quarterly payments from optimer for our co promotion activities of dificid 

table of contents other revenues other revenues for the years ended december  and  were million and million  respectively 
other revenues for the year ended december   includes a million cumulative adjustment under the contingency adjusted performance model associated with a million milestone payment received under our agreement with merck related to regulatory approval of cubicin in japan 
the remainder of the milestone payment was recognized as deferred revenue and will be amortized to other revenues over the performance period ending january in addition  we received a million sales milestone during the year ended december   as a result of novartis achieving a predetermined level of aggregate sales of cubicin to third parties  which we recognized as other revenue upon achievement 
costs and expenses the following table sets forth costs and expenses for the periods presented for the years ended december  change in millions cost of product revenues research and development contingent consideration selling  general and administrative restructuring charges n a total costs and expenses cost of product revenues cost of product revenues were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
included in our cost of product revenues are royalties owed on net sales of cubicin under our license agreement with eli lilly  costs to procure  manufacture and distribute cubicin  and the amortization expense related to certain intangible assets 
our gross margin for the years ended december  and  was 
the increase in cost of product revenues of million during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   is primarily attributable to the increase in sales of cubicin in the us we expect our gross margin percentage in to be similar to our gross margin percentage in research and development expense total research and development expense for the year ended december   was million as compared to million for the year ended december   and consisted of the following for the years ended december  change in millions third party research and development costs other research and development costs milestone and upfront payments total research and development 
table of contents the increase in research and development expense was due primarily to i an increase of million in clinical trial expenses related to cxa  in which phase clinical trials for cuti and ciai were completed and first patient enrollment in phase clinical trials for both indications was achieved during  ii an increase of million in milestone expense related to a million development milestone paid to astellas as a result of first patient enrollment for the phase trial of cxa in cuti in and a million development milestone recorded during the year ended december   and paid to hydra in january  as a result of a cta filing in december for cb  and iii an increase of million in employee related expenses 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in the increase in expense is expected to be driven by clinical trial expenses  including the cost to purchase the material for use in clinical trials  and continued investment in process and development activities of our pipeline  particularly phase clinical trial activities related to the development of cxa  cb and cb contingent consideration expense contingent consideration expense was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this expense primarily represents the change in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability relating to potential remaining amounts payable to calixa s former stockholders upon the achievement of certain development  regulatory and sales milestones  pursuant to our agreement to acquire calixa in december approximately million of the change in the fair value for the year ended december   relates to achieving the milestones for first patient enrollment in the phase clinical trials of cxa for cuti and ciai  increasing the probabilities of success for subsequent associated milestones and recognizing expense related to the time value of money 
in addition  the probability of enrollment in a phase clinical trial of cxa as a potential treatment for habp and vabp in was increased  and the resulting fair value of the associated milestone was increased  which resulted in additional expense of million 
contingent consideration expense may fluctuate significantly in future periods depending on changes in estimates  including probabilities associated with achieving the milestones and the period in which we estimate these milestones will be achieved 
we expect that contingent consideration expense will decrease in as compared to selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense for the year ended december   was million as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in selling  general and administrative expense is primarily related to an increase of million in payroll  benefits and other employee related expenses due to an increase in headcount and transaction fees of million incurred in connection with the acquisition of adolor in december the increase was partially offset by a decrease of approximately million in rental expense as a result of the acquisition of the building and land located at hayden in july  which we previously leased 
we expect selling  general and administrative expense in to increase modestly  in the aggregate  primarily due to an increase in salaries  benefits and employee related expenses due to an increase in headcount during  as well as selling related expenses to support entereg and expenses related to litigation we plan to file against hospira with respect to hospira s anda filing 
restructuring expense in connection with our acquisition of adolor  we committed to a restructuring program in the fourth quarter of  which included severance benefits to former adolor employees and execution of 
table of contents a lease termination agreement for adolor s operating lease for its facility in exton  pennsylvania  as of december  cubist incurred charges of million in the fourth quarter of related to these activities

net cash provided by financing activities in included cash received from the issuance of million of our notes  offset by repayment of million in aggregate principal of our notes and million of debt issuance costs incurred in connection with the issuance of the notes 
see note m  debt  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
net cash provided by financing activities also included cash received from stock option exercises and purchases of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
commitments and contingencies legal proceedings in april  we entered into a settlement agreement with teva and its affiliates to resolve our patent infringement litigation with respect to cubicin 
we originally filed the patent infringement lawsuit in march in response to the february notification to us by teva that it had submitted an anda to the fda seeking approval to market a generic version of cubicin 
the settlement agreement provides for a full settlement and release by both us and teva of all claims that were or could have been asserted in the patent infringement litigation and all resulting damages or other remedies 
among other things  we granted teva a non exclusive  royalty free license to sell a generic daptomycin for injection product in the us beginning on the later of i december   and ii if our daptomycin for injection product receives pediatric exclusivity  june  see the business section in item of part i of this annual report on form k for additional information on the agreement  including  among other things  a summary of the licenses granted under the agreement  terms of the agreement that relate to the timing of the licenses  the scope of the licenses  the termination provisions  and provisions related to our obligation to supply cubicin to teva 

table of contents contingent consideration adolor if certain regulatory milestones  sales milestones or a combination of both are achieved  with respect to cb  we have committed  under the terms of the acquisition agreement pursuant to which we acquired adolor in december  to make future payments to the former shareholders of adolor 
we granted non transferable cprs to the former shareholders of adolor  which represent the right to receive additional payments above the upfront purchase price  up to a maximum amount of for each share owned by adolor s former shareholders upon achievement of such milestones 
the aggregate  undiscounted amount that cubist could pay under the merger agreement ranges from zero to approximately million 
calixa if certain development  regulatory  or commercial milestones are achieved with respect to cxa  or other products that incorporate cxa  we have committed  under the terms of the merger agreement pursuant to which we acquired calixa in december  to make future milestone payments to the former stockholders of calixa 
first patient enrollment in phase clinical trials for cuti and ciai triggered a million milestone obligation related to cuti and a million milestone obligation related to ciai 
cubist paid the cuti related milestone to calixa s former stockholders during the third quarter of and paid the ciai related milestone in january we may be required to make up to an additional million of undiscounted payments to the former stockholders of calixa  including a million milestone expected to be triggered in the second half of related to first patient enrollment in a phase clinical trial for hapb and vabp 
in accordance with accounting for business combinations guidance  contingent consideration liabilities are required to be recognized on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
estimating the fair value of contingent consideration requires the use of significant assumptions primarily relating to expectations regarding the probability of achieving certain development  regulatory  and sales milestones  the expected timing in which these milestones will be achieved  and a discount rate 
the use of different assumptions could result in materially different estimates of fair value 
as of december   the contingent consideration related to the adolor and calixa acquisitions are our only financial liabilities measured using level inputs in accordance with accounting guidance for fair value measurements and represents of the total financial liabilities measured at fair value 
see note f  fair value measurements  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

table of contents contractual obligations contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties 
the following summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december   and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods payments due by period year or less years years more than years total in millions convertible senior and subordinated notes interest on convertible senior and subordinated notes royalty payments inventory purchase obligations contingent consideration obligations other purchase obligations other liabilities total contractual cash obligations the convertible senior and subordinated notes consist of a remaining million aggregate principal amount of our notes  due in november  and a remaining million aggregate principal amount of our notes  due in june the notes require semi annual interest payments beginning in may through maturity  and the notes require semi annual interest payments through maturity 
the royalty payments listed above represent amounts expected to be owed through december   to i eli lilly on sales of cubicin  ii eli lilly and shire on sales of entereg  and iii glaxo on sales of entereg through december  committed payments do not reflect the impact of royalties on future sales of cubicin and entereg beyond december   because we are unable to reliably estimate such total cubicin and entereg sales on which royalties would be due 
the inventory purchase obligations listed above primarily represent purchases for the manufacturing of cubicin api by our supplier  acsd  under the amended manufacturing and supply agreement with acsd  as well as payments for converting cubicin api into its finished  vialed and packaged formulation under separate agreements for these services 
the expected payments for minimum inventory purchase obligations have been translated to us dollars using the exchange rate between us dollars and euros at december  the contingent consideration obligations included above represent amounts for which we can reliably estimate the timing and amount of payments expected to be made to i the former stockholders of calixa upon the achievement of certain development milestones with respect to cxa in connection with our acquisition of calixa  and ii the former stockholders of adolor upon the achievement of certain regulatory and commercialization milestones with respect to cb these contingent consideration obligations have not been probability adjusted or discounted 
cubist made a million milestone payment  included in the table above  in january the total undiscounted amounts potentially payable to the former stockholders of calixa and adolor  in excess of amounts included in the table above  are million and million  respectively  the payment of which is contingent upon the achievement of certain development  regulatory and sales based milestones 
other purchase obligations listed above primarily represent expected amounts owed to our cros  and independent clinical investigators related to clinical trials of candidates in our product 
table of contents pipeline  as well as amounts owed to our third party service provider for the purposes of conducting clinical trials on our behalf related to cxa other purchase obligations also include expected amounts for future research funding under our collaboration agreements 
other liabilities listed above primarily represent amounts owed to glaxo as a result of the termination agreement entered into between adolor and glaxo in june adolor agreed to pay glaxo million  of which million was paid in august  payable in six remaining installments over a six year period beginning in august in exchange for the return to adolor of full commercialization rights to entereg 
in december  we assumed the remaining obligations of million owed to glaxo as a result of the acquisition of adolor 
the annual payments listed above have not been discounted 
in addition to the commitments discussed above  we have commitments to make potential future milestone payments to third parties under our license and collaboration arrangements totaling approximately million  which include million for development milestones  million for regulatory milestones and million for sales based milestones 
these milestones primarily include the commencement and results of clinical trials  obtaining regulatory approval in various jurisdictions and the future commercial success of development programs  the outcome and timing of which are difficult to predict and subject to significant uncertainty 
in addition to the milestones discussed above  we are obligated to pay royalties on future sales  which are contingent on generating levels of sales of future products that have not been achieved and may never be achieved 
since we are unable to reliably estimate the timing and amounts of such milestone and royalty payments  or whether they will occur at all  these contingent payments have been excluded from the table above 
see note c  business agreements  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our license  collaboration and acquisition arrangements 
reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of million have also been excluded from the table above due to the inability to predict the timing of tax audit resolutions 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any relationships with entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements  including off balance sheet arrangements as described in sec regulation s k item as such we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  which requires management to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures 
we evaluate our estimates  judgments and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
actual amounts may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  inventories  clinical research costs  investments  
table of contents business combinations  intangible assets and impairment income taxes  stock based compensation  and contingent consideration 
i 
revenue recognition our principal sources of revenue are i sales of cubicin in the us  ii revenues derived from sales of cubicin by our international distribution partners  iii license fees and milestone payments that are derived from collaboration  license and distribution agreements with other pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies  and iv service revenues derived from our promotion and support of dificid 
we expect to include sales of entereg in the us as an additional source of revenue in the future 
in all instances  revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  and collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
multiple element arrangements on january   we adopted new authoritative guidance on revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements 
the guidance  which applies to multiple element arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after january   amends the criteria for separating and allocating consideration in a multiple element arrangement by modifying the fair value requirements for revenue recognition and eliminating the use of the residual method 
the fair value of deliverables under the arrangement may be derived using a best estimate of selling price if vendor specific objective evidence and third party evidence is not available 
deliverables under the arrangement will be separate units of accounting  provided i a delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis  and ii if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item  delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in our control 
we entered into the co promotion agreement with optimer in april  which was evaluated under the accounting guidance on revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements  as noted below 
cubist s other existing license and collaboration agreements continue to be accounted for under previously issued revenue recognition guidance for multiple element arrangements 
us product revenues  net we maintain a drop ship program under which orders are processed through wholesalers  but shipments are sent directly to our end users  who are generally hospitals and acute care settings 
we generally do not allow wholesalers to stock cubicin or entereg 
this results in sales trending closely to actual hospital and acute care settings purchases 
all revenues from product sales are recorded net of applicable provisions for returns  chargebacks  discounts  wholesaler management fees and medicaid and medicare coverage gap discount program rebates in the same period the related sales are recorded 
reserves for us product revenues our return policy allows our customers to return product within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the expiration date of the product 
our estimate of the provision offsetting returns is analyzed quarterly and is based upon many factors  including historical experience of actual returns  analysis of the level of inventory in the distribution channel  if any  and reorder rates of end users 
if 
table of contents we discontinue the drop ship program and allow wholesalers to stock cubicin  our net product sales may be impacted 
we analyze our estimates and assumptions for chargebacks and medicaid and medicare coverage gap discount program rebate reserves quarterly 
our reserves for chargebacks and for medicaid and medicare rebates have two components i an estimate of outstanding claims for known end user rebate eligible sales that have occurred  but for which related claim submissions have not been received  and ii an estimate of chargebacks and medicaid and medicare rebates based on an analysis of customer sales mix data to determine which sales may flow through to a rebate or chargeback eligible customer 
effective march   the affordable care act extended medicaid rebates to drug volume issued to medicaid patients whose drug coverage is managed by mcos under individual agreements with states 
we accrue for the expected liability at the time we record the sale  however  the time lag between sale and payment of medicaid and medicare rebates can be lengthy 
due to the time lag  in any particular period our medicaid and medicare rebate adjustments may incorporate revisions of accruals for several periods 
reserves for medicaid and  commencing in january  medicare coverage gap discount program rebates  are included in accrued liabilities and were million and million at december  and  respectively 
reserves for returns  discounts  chargebacks and wholesaler management fees are offset against accounts receivable and were million and million at december  and  respectively 
we believe that the reserves we have established are reasonable and appropriate based upon current facts and circumstances 
applying different judgments to the same facts and circumstances would result in the estimated amounts for sales returns  chargebacks and medicaid rebate reserves to vary 
however  due to the drop ship model under which we currently operate  and our experience to date of actual product returns  chargebacks and medicaid rebate claims  we do not expect that the differences would be material 
international product revenues we sell our product to international distribution partners based upon transfer price arrangements that are generally established annually 
once cubist s distribution partner sells the product to a third party  we may be owed an additional payment or royalty based on a percentage of the net selling price to the third party  less the initial transfer price previously paid for the product 
under no circumstances would the subsequent adjustment result in a refund to the distribution partner of the initial transfer price 
we recognize the additional revenue upon receipt of royalty statements from our distribution partners 
certain agreements with our distribution partners contain multiple elements in which cubist has continuing performance obligations 
in such arrangements in which we determined that the undelivered elements in each arrangement did not have reliable evidence of fair value  payments from distribution partners are recorded as deferred revenue 
we amortize deferred revenue to international product revenue over the performance period of each arrangement under the contingency adjusted performance model 
service revenues service revenues represent amounts earned as a result of agreements we have established with partners to co promote drug products 
we use our existing sales force to assist in the promotion of these drugs to physicians  hospitals  long term care facilities and other health care institutions 
we currently have an agreement with optimer to co promote dificid in the us the initial term of the co promotion agreement is approximately two years from the date of first commercial sale of dificid in the us  which occurred in july we assessed the co promotion agreement under the accounting guidance on revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements 
the deliverables under 
table of contents the co promotion agreement with optimer include co promotion of dificid  participation in joint committees and providing medical affairs support for dificid 
each identified deliverable within the arrangement was determined to be a separate unit of accounting  and the performance period of each deliverable was deemed to be the term of the co promotion agreement 
there are no performance obligations extending beyond the term of the arrangement 
as a result  we are recognizing the service fees ratably over the performance period ending july  see note c  business agreements  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
other revenues other revenues include revenue related to upfront license payments  license fees and milestone payments received through cubist s license  collaboration and commercialization agreements 
on january   we adopted new authoritative guidance on revenue recognition for milestone payments related to arrangements with continuing performance obligations 
consideration for events that meet the definition of a milestone in accordance with the accounting guidance for the milestone method of revenue recognition is recognized as revenue in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved only if all of the following conditions are met i the milestone is commensurate with either cubist s performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the delivered item as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our performance to achieve the milestone  ii the consideration relates solely to past performance  and iii the amount of the milestone consideration is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms  including other potential milestone consideration  within the arrangement 
otherwise  the milestone payments are not considered to be substantive and are  therefore  deferred and recognized as revenue over the term of the arrangement as cubist completes its performance obligations 
the adoption of this guidance did not materially change our previous method of recognizing milestone payments 
during the year ended december   merck received regulatory approval of cubicin in japan  which triggered a million milestone payment to cubist 
the milestone was assessed under the accounting guidance for the milestone method of revenue recognition and was not deemed to be substantive and  therefore  only approximately million was recognized as other revenue during the year ended december  the remainder of the milestone payment will be amortized to other revenues over the performance period ending january see note c  business agreements  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
ii 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined under the first in  first out fifo basis 
on a quarterly basis  we analyze our inventory levels and write down inventory that is expected to expire prior to being sold  inventory in excess of expected sales requirements and inventory that fails to meet commercial sale specifications through a charge to cost of product revenues 
expired inventory is disposed of  and the related costs are written off to cost of product revenues 
charges for inventory write downs are not reversed if it is later determined that the product is saleable 
therefore  any such written down inventory would be sold at significantly higher margin 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 

table of contents iii 
clinical research costs we utilize external entities such as cros  independent clinical investigators  and other third party service providers to assist us with the execution of our clinical studies 
contracts and studies vary significantly in duration and are generally composed of a fixed management fee  variable indirect reimbursable costs and amounts owed on a per patient enrollment basis 
we record costs for clinical study activities based upon the estimated amount of services provided but not yet invoiced for each study  and include these costs in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets and within research and development expense in our consolidated statements of income 
we defer and capitalize nonrefundable advance payments made by us for research and development activities  including clinical research activities  until the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
milestones paid to collaborators are expensed as incurred if the payment is not payment for future services 
we monitor the activity levels and patient enrollment levels of the studies through communication with the service providers  detailed invoice and task completion review  analysis of actual expenses against budget  pre approval of any changes in scope and review of contractual terms 
these estimates may or may not match the actual services performed by the service providers as determined by actual patient enrollment levels and other variable activity costs 
the level of clinical study expense may vary from period to period based on the number of studies that are in process  the duration of each study  the level of patient enrollment  the number of sites involved in each study and the global location of sites 
clinical trials that bear the greatest risk of change in estimates are typically those that have a significant number of sites  require significantly high patient enrollment rates  have complex patient screening requirements or that span multiple years 
if we receive incomplete or inaccurate information from our third party service providers  we may under or over estimate activity levels associated with various studies at a given point in time 
in this event  we could record adjustments to prior period accruals that increase or reverse research and development expenses in future periods when the actual activity level becomes known 
iv 
investments investments with original maturities of greater than days and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short term investments 
investments with remaining maturities of greater than one year are classified as long term investments 
our short term investments include bank deposits  corporate and municipal notes  us treasury securities  and us government agency securities 
long term investments may include corporate notes  us treasury securities and us government agency securities 
investments are considered available for sale as of december  and  and are carried at fair value 
in accordance with fair value measurement guidance  we categorize investments within the fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used to estimate fair value  which may be based on observable and or unobservable inputs 
observable inputs reflect readily obtainable data from independent sources  while unobservable inputs reflect certain market assumptions 
the fair value hierarchy level is determined by asset class based on the lowest level of significant input 
as of december   the fair value estimates for our investments utilize observable inputs and are categorized as level or level of the fair value hierarchy  which is described in note b  accounting policies  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
investments are initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued using information obtained through a third party pricing service 
the pricing service uses various market inputs to determine value  including trade information  broker or dealer quotes  bids  offers  market interest rates or a combination of these data sources 
we corroborate the prices provided by our third party pricing service by obtaining  analyzing market data from other pricing sources and confirming that the relevant markets are active 
see note e  investments  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

table of contents unrealized gains and temporary losses on investments are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss as a separate component of stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses  dividends  interest income and declines in value judged to be other than temporary credit losses are included in other income expense 
any premium or discount arising at purchase is amortized and or accreted to interest income 
v 
business combinations on december   we acquired adolor for total consideration of million  consisting of a cash payment of million and contingent consideration with an estimated fair value of million 
the transaction was accounted for as a business combination under the acquisition method of accounting 
accordingly  the tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at fair value 
transaction costs were expensed as incurred 
the following table summarizes these estimated fair values december  in millions cash investments inventory ipr d entereg intangible asset deferred tax assets goodwill other assets acquired total assets acquired deferred tax liabilities payable to glaxo other liabilities assumed total liabilities assumed total net assets acquired the difference between the purchase price of million and the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed of million was recorded as goodwill 
none of this goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes 
we acquired commercial entereg inventory and recorded it at its fair value  which required a step up adjustment to recognize the inventory at its expected net realizable value 
the inventory step up will be recorded to cost of product revenues within the consolidated statement of income as the related inventory is sold  which is expected to be over a period of approximately eight years 
of the identifiable assets acquired through our acquisition of adolor  million relates to ipr d for cb the fair value of the acquired ipr d asset was determined using an income approach  including a discount rate of  applied to the probability adjusted after tax cash flows 
we believe the assumptions are representative of those a market participant would use in estimating fair value 
cb is an oral  peripherally restricted mu opioid receptor antagonist currently in development for the treatment of chronic oic 
cubist expects to initiate phase clinical trials in the estimated research and development cost to advance cb to commercialization ranges from million to million  which includes potential milestones associated with cb assuming successful results in clinical trials  we intend to commercially launch cb in 
table of contents we also recorded million of finite lived other intangible assets related to the rights to entereg 
the fair value of the acquired entereg intangible asset was determined using an income approach  including a discount rate of  applied to the after tax cash flows 
the entereg intangible asset is being amortized using the straight line method over approximately nine years 
estimating the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination requires significant judgment 
the use of different estimates could result in materially different fair values 
vi 
intangible assets and impairment other intangible assets other intangible assets consist of patents  intellectual property  acquired technology rights  manufacturing rights  and other intangibles 
we amortize our intangible assets using the straight line method over their estimated economic lives  which range from six years to years 
determining the economic lives of intangible assets requires us to make significant judgments and estimates and can materially impact our operating results 
other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate 
judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on historical and projected future operating results  changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets  overall business strategy  and market and economic trends 
future events could cause management to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that certain long lived assets are impaired 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated from the use of the asset group and its eventual disposition 
we did not recognize an impairment charge related to our long lived and other intangible assets during the years ended december   and goodwill goodwill totaled approximately million as of december   and relates to our acquisitions of adolor and calixa in december and december  respectively 
goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired under the acquisition method of accounting 
goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment within our single reporting unit on an annual basis  during the fourth quarter  or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting unit below its carrying amount 
in september  the fasb issued amended guidance that simplified how to test for goodwill impairment  which we early adopted for our annual goodwill impairment test 
this guidance permits us to first perform a qualitative assessment as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then performing the two step impairment test is not required 
if the two step goodwill impairment test was required  we would assess the fair value of our reporting unit as compared to its carrying value  including goodwill  as part of the first step 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of our reporting unit  then goodwill may be impaired and the second step of the impairment test is performed in order to determine the amount of goodwill impairment 
in the second step  if the carrying value of our reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then cubist would record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
as provided for in the amended guidance  we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and instead performed step one of the two step goodwill impairment test 
we determined that the carrying value of our single reporting unit did not exceed its fair value  
table of contents and therefore  goodwill was not impaired as of december  we did not recognize any impairment charges related to goodwill during the years ended december   and ipr d upon acquisition  ipr d assets are recorded at their acquisition date fair value 
until the underlying project is completed  these assets are accounted for as indefinite lived intangible assets 
once the project is completed  the carrying value of the ipr d is amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset and is subject to impairment testing 
post acquisition research and development expenses related to the ipr d projects are expensed as incurred 
the valuation models used to estimate the fair values of our ipr d reflects significant assumptions regarding the estimates a market participant would make in order to evaluate a drug development asset  including probability of successfully completing clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approval  market size and market growth projections  estimates regarding the timing of and the expected costs to advance our clinical programs to commercialization  estimates of future cash flows from potential product sales  and a discount rate 
the use of different assumptions or changes in assumptions used could result in materially different fair values 
in connection with the acquisition of calixa in december  we identified and recorded million as ipr d assets relating to cxa for cuti  ciai  habp and vabp indications 
as of the date of acquisition  the intangible asset related to cxa for habp and vabp had an estimated fair value of million  and the intangible assets related to cxa for cuti and ciai had an estimated fair value of million 
we assessed the fair value of ipr d assets using an income approach  including discounted cash flow models that are probability adjusted for assumptions relating to the development and potential commercialization of cxa development of cxa requires various levels of in house and external testing  clinical trials and approvals from the fda or comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it could be commercialized in the us or other territories 
the estimated research and development cost to advance cxa to commercialization  which includes potential milestones  ranges from million to million for the cuti and ciai indications and from million to million for the pneumonia indications 
assuming successful results in clinical trials and regulatory approval  we expect to commercially launch cxa with cuti and ciai indications in and with the pneumonia indications in the estimated costs to complete each ipr d project represent management s best estimate of expected costs  but are subject to change based on additional information to be received as development activities advance 
in connection with the acquisition of adolor in december  we also indentified and recorded ipr d relating to cb see business combinations within this critical accounting policies and estimates section for additional information 
the successful development of new pharmaceutical products is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  those set forth in the risk factors section of this annual report on form k 
given these uncertainties  there can be no assurance that our clinical programs will be successfully developed for the pursued indications or  if successfully developed  that these programs will be developed in the timeframes described above 
if such development is not successful or 
table of contents completed in a timely manner or is more expensive than currently anticipated  we may not realize the financial benefits expected for our clinical programs or for the related acquisitions as a whole  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
ipr d is tested for impairment on an annual basis  in the fourth quarter  or more frequently if impairment indicators are present  using projected discounted cash flow models 
if ipr d becomes impaired or is abandoned  the carrying value of the ipr d is written down to its revised fair value with the related impairment charge recognized in the period in which the impairment occurs 
if the fair value of the asset becomes impaired as the result of unfavorable data from any ongoing or future clinical trial  changes in assumptions that negatively impact projected cash flows  or because of any other information regarding the prospects of successfully developing or commercializing our programs  we could incur significant charges in the period in which the impairment occurs 
the valuation techniques utilized in performing impairment tests incorporate significant assumptions and judgments to estimate the fair value  as described above 
the use of different valuation techniques or different assumptions could result in materially different fair value estimates 
we did not recognize any impairment charges related to ipr d during the years ended december   and vii 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
a deferred tax asset is established for the expected future benefit of nol and credit carryforwards 
a valuation reserve against net deferred tax assets is required if  based upon available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in accounting for uncertain tax positions  we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the tax position 
the evaluation of uncertain tax positions is based on factors that include  but are not limited to  changes in tax law  the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns  the effective settlement of matters subject to audit and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position 
any changes to these estimates  based on the actual results obtained and or a change in assumptions  could impact our income tax provision in future periods 
interest and penalty charges  if any  related to unrecognized tax benefits would be classified as a provision for income tax in the consolidated statement of income 
viii 
stock based compensation we expense the fair value of employee stock options and other forms of stock based employee compensation  including restricted stock units  using the straight line method over the employees service periods  which are generally the vesting period of the equity award 
in order to determine the fair value of option awards on the date of grant  we use the black scholes option pricing model 
inherent in this model are assumptions related to expected stock price volatility  estimated option life  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
the risk free interest rate is a less subjective assumption as it is based on factual data derived from public sources 
we use a dividend yield of zero as we have never paid cash dividends and have no intention to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
our expected stock price volatility assumption is based on historical volatilities of our stock  which are obtained from public data sources 
the expected life represents the weighted average period of time that stock based awards are expected to be outstanding giving consideration to vesting schedules and our historical exercise patterns 
we determine the expected life assumption based on the exercise behavior and post vesting behavior that has been exhibited historically  adjusted for specific factors that 
table of contents may influence future exercise patterns 
we estimate forfeitures based on our historical experience of stock based pre vesting cancellations 
we believe that our estimates are based on outcomes that are reasonably likely to occur 
to the extent actual forfeitures differ from our estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
see note k  employee stock benefit plans  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
ix 
contingent consideration each period we revalue the contingent consideration obligations associated with certain acquisitions to their then fair value and record increases in the fair value as contingent consideration expense and record decreases in the fair value as a reduction of contingent consideration expense 
changes in contingent consideration expense result from changes in the assumptions regarding probabilities of successful achievement of related milestones  the estimated timing in which the milestones are achieved and the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the liability 
contingent consideration expense may change significantly as development of our clinical programs in certain indications progress and additional data is obtained  impacting our assumptions 
the assumptions used in estimating fair value require significant judgment 
the use of different assumptions and judgments could result in a materially different estimate of fair value 
see note f  fair value measurements  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued amended accounting guidance for goodwill in order to simplify how companies test goodwill for impairment 
the amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted 
we adopted this guidance for the year ended december  the adoption did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
see note b  accounting polices  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
in june  the fasb issued an amendment to the accounting guidance for presentation of comprehensive income 
under the amended guidance  a company may present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in either case  a company is required to present each component of net income along with total net income  each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income  and a total amount for comprehensive income 
the amendment originally required the company to present on the face of the financial statements reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statement s where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented  however  this provision was deferred under amended accounting guidance issued by the fasb in december for public companies  the amendment to the accounting guidance for presentation of comprehensive income is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december   and shall be applied retrospectively 
we adopted this amendment on january  other than a change in presentation  the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb amended the accounting guidance for fair value to develop common requirements between gaap and international financial reporting standards 
the amendments clarify the fasb s intent about the application of existing fair value measurement and disclosure requirements and in some instances change a particular principle or requirement for measuring fair value or for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
notable changes under the amended guidance include i application of the highest and best use and valuation premise concepts solely for 
table of contents non financial assets and liabilities  ii measuring the fair value of an instrument classified in a reporting entity s shareholders equity  and iii disclosing quantitative information about unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement within level of the fair value hierarchy

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  which may include bank deposits  money market instruments  securities issued by the us government and its agencies  and investment grade corporate and municipal bonds 
these investments are primarily denominated in us dollars 
all of our interest bearing securities are subject to interest rate risk and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate 
we currently own securities that are sensitive to market risks as part of our investment portfolio 
the primary objective in managing our cash is to preserve capital and provide adequate liquidity to fund operations 
none of these market risk sensitive securities are held for trading purposes 
the potential change in the fair value of our fixed rate investments has been assessed on a hypothetical basis point adverse movement across all maturities 
we estimate that such hypothetical adverse basis point movement would result in a decrease in fair value of million and million on our fixed rate investments at december  and  respectively 
as of december   the fair value of the notes and notes was estimated by us to be million and million  respectively 
as of december   the fair value of the notes and notes was estimated by us to be million and million  respectively 
we determined the estimated fair value of the notes and notes by using quoted market rates 
if interest rates were to increase by basis points  the fair value of our notes and our notes would decrease approximately million and million  respectively  at december  if interest rates were to increase by basis points  the fair value of our notes and our notes would decrease approximately million and million  respectively  at december
