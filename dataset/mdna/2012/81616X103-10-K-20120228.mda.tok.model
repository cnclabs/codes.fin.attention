effective in the first quarter of  we changed our accounting policy for payments due from financial services companies for credit card and debit card transactions 
historically  at each reporting period  we classified all credit card and debit card transactions that processed in less than seven days as cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheets 
we now classify these credit card and debit card transactions as accounts receivable until the cash is received 
we believe that our new policy is preferable because the presentation i more appropriately aligns with our view that these credit card and debit card receivables are not part of our cash management processes ie  these receivables are non interest bearing and are not taken into consideration when making cash management decisions  and ii is more consistent with the nature of the credit card and debit card receivables  which are subject to the credit risk of the financial services companies
