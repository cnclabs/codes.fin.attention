item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s investing activities are not part of its operating business and function as a separate segment 
the company also engages in the short selling of stock 
when this occurs  the short position is marked to market and this adjustment is recorded as a unrealized gain or loss in the statement of operations for the period presented historical cost is used by the company to determine all gains and losses  and fair market value is obtained by readily available market quotes on all securities 
the company s investment goals  strategies and policies are as follows the company s investment goals are capital preservation  maintaining returns on capital with a high degree of safety and generating income from dividends and option sales to help offset operating losses 
in order to achieve these goals  the company maintains a diversified securities portfolio comprised primarily of electric utility common and preferred stocks 
the company also sells covered calls on portions of its portfolio and also sells puts on stocks it is willing to own 
it also sells uncovered calls and may have net short positions in common stock up to of the value of the portfolio 
the company s net short position may temporarily rise to of the company s portfolio without any specific action because of changes in valuation  but should not exceed this amount 
the company s investment policy is to maintain a minimum of of its portfolio in electric utilities 
the board of directors has authorized this minimum to be temporarily lowered to when company management deems it to be necessary 
investments in utilities are primarily in electric companies 
investments in non utility stocks will generally not exceed of the value of the portfolio 
investment in speculative issues  including short sales  maximum of 
limited use of options to increase yearly investment income 
a 
the use of call options 
covered options can be sold up to a maximum of of the value of the portfolio 
this provides extra income in addition to dividends received from the company s investments 
the risk of this strategy is that investments may be called away  which the company may have preferred to retain 
therefore  a limitation of is placed on the amount of stock on which options can be written 
the amount of the portfolio on which options are actually written is usually between of the portfolio 
the historical turnover of the portfolio is such that the average holding period is in excess of five years for available for sale securities 
b 
the use of put options 
put options are written on stocks which the company is willing to purchase 
while the company does not have a high rate of turnover in its portfolio  there is some turnover  for example  due to preferred stocks being called back by the issuing company  or stocks being called away because call options have been written 
if the stock does not go below the put exercise price  the company records the proceeds from the sale as income 
if the put is exercised  the cost basis is reduced by the proceeds received from the sale of the put option 
there may be occasions where the cost basis of the stock is lower than the market price at the time the option is exercised 
c 
speculative short sales short options 
the company normally limits its speculative transactions to no more than of the value of the portfolio 
the company may sell uncovered calls on certain stocks 
if the stock price does not rise to the price of the call  the option is not exercised and the company records the proceeds from the sale of the call as income 
if the call is exercised  the company will have a short position in the related stock 
the company then has the choice of covering the short position  or selling a put against it 
if the put is exercised  then the short position is covered 
the company s current accounting policy is to mark to market at the end of each quarter any short positions  and include it in the income statement 
while the company may have so called speculative positions equal to of its accounts  in actual practice the net short stock positions usually account for less than of the assets of the company 
in the event of a merger  the company will elect to receive shares in the new company if this is an option 
if the proposed merger is a cash only offer  the company will receive cash and be forced to sell the stock 
item a 
risk factors operating losses the company has incurred cumulative net operating losses of  during the five year period ended december  these losses have mainly resulted from ongoing expenses for marketing and research and development as the company attempts to build a market for its products 
during this same time period  the company s cumulative net income from investments and other items exceeded the operating losses and provided the necessary funds for our continued research and development and marketing 
it is the opinion of management that the financial health of the company would have been adversely affected if our net income from investments during this time had been substantially less than losses from operations 
there is no guarantee that future net income from investments will continue to completely offset operating losses as was the case for the five year period ended december  sales of blood volume kits in the company s fiscal year ended december   the sale of blood volume kits accounted for of the company s total consolidated operating revenue 
there were four customers hospitals that accounted for of the company s revenue from blood volume kits 
management believes that the loss of any one customer would have an adverse effect on the company s consolidated business for a short period of time 
all four of these hospitals have purchased their bva equipment 
management believes that when more hospitals purchase equipment  they will continue to purchase volumex kits 
the company continues to seek new customers  so that any one hospital will represent a smaller percentage of overall sales 
in the company s fiscal year ended december   the sale of blood volume kits accounted for of the company s total consolidated operating revenue 
there were four customers hospitals that accounted for of the company s revenue from the sale of blood volume kits 
medicare and medicaid reimbursement as disclosed in our previous filings  the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms implemented a significant policy change affecting the reimbursement for all diagnostic radiopharmaceutical products and contrast agents which was effective as of january  as a result of this policy change  diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals such as daxor s volumex are no longer separately reimbursable by medicare for outpatient services 
at this time  it is still unclear if this policy change will also be implemented by private third party health insurance companies 
the reimbursement policy for hospital outpatients through december  included payment for both the cost of the procedure to perform a blood volume analysis bva and the radiopharmaceutical daxor s volumex radiopharmaceutical 
cms s policy now only includes the reimbursement for the procedure and would require the hospital to absorb the cost of the radiopharmaceutical 
there will be an upward adjustment for the procedure code to include some of the costs of the radiopharmaceutical 
however  this upward adjustment does not entirely cover the costs associated with the procedure and the radiopharmaceutical 
in response to medicare s change in its reimbursement policy for diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals  daxor has lobbied cms both individually and as a member of the society of nuclear medicine s apc task force  which is a select group of representatives from industry and healthcare that represents the more than  nuclear medicine professionals in the united states 
one of the missions of the apc task force is to work directly with the cms in an attempt to amend the current policy limiting the reimbursement of diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals for outpatient diagnostic services 
there is no guarantee that the apc task force will be successful in their efforts to persuade the cms to amend their policy of limiting the reimbursement of diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals for outpatient diagnostic services 
this change in medicare s reimbursement policy was still in effect at december  health insurance legislation on march   the us house of representatives passed the patient protection and affordable care act hr 
this legislation was signed into law by president obama on march  the goal of this legislation is to make health care more accessible to americans 
at this time  we are unable to quantify how this legislation will affect our operating income 
although it is possible that increased coverage could lead to greater access to our products and services if the reimbursement rate is lower  this would limit the benefit to daxor and could have a negative effect on our operating results and our business 
available for sale securities at december   of the fair market value of the company s investment portfolio consisted of utility stocks whose market price can be sensitive to rising interest rates 
at december   of the company s investment portfolio consisted of utility stocks 
the company s investment policy calls for a minimum of of the investment portfolio to consist of utility stocks 
the board of directors has authorized this minimum to be temporarily lowered to when management deems it to be necessary 
at december   the company s investment portfolio consisted of separate stocks 
the top five holdings as of this date in the investment portfolio were the common stock of entergy  exelon  first energy  bank of america and national grid 
these five holdings comprised of the value of the investment portfolio 
entergy  exelon  first energy and national grid accounted for of the dividend income for the year ended december  the company also receives significant income from option sales related to its investment portfolio 
the income from options is variable  and less predictable than income from dividends from the company s portfolio  which have minor variations 
the ability of the company to sell options is related to the market value of its available for sale securities 
if there is a decrease in the market value of the company available for sale securities  this could negatively impact income from option sales 
there is a risk that in an environment of rising interest rates that the market value of these stocks could decline and the utilities could reduce their dividend payments to compensate for increased interest expense 
this could have an adverse effect on the company s ability to fund research and development and marketing efforts necessary to build a market for our products 
key individual the company has a significant dependence on a single individual  dr 
joseph feldschuh  who is the ceo of the company 
dr 
feldschuh is the chief scientist of the company and is believed to have more experience with blood volume measurement than any other physician in the united states 
he is involved in assisting and advising various physician groups that are conducting research 
his scientific knowledge would be difficult to replace 
dr 
feldschuh is also the sole individual responsible for investment decisions with respect to the company s investment portfolio 
the loss of his services in this area would be expected to result in a material reduction in return on the company s assets 
patents our patents for the bva expired in the company filed two additional patent applications for an automated instrument to measure human blood volume in march of the filings describe innovations which will be incorporated into the company s bva blood volume analyzer 
these applications supplement the patent application filed in the fourth quarter of for a total body albumin analyzer 
the company does not know when  or if these patent applications will be approved 
the blood volume analyzer  however  works most efficiently with the tracer injection kit system which has a separate patent and which expires in it is possible that another company could develop another version of the blood volume analyzer which would use a different tracer injection kit 
to the best of our knowledge  this has not happened yet and management views the development of a competing tracer injection kit as unlikely 
volumex syringes all of the company s orders for volumex syringes are filled by a single fda approved radio pharmaceutical manufacturer 
this manufacturer is the only one approved by the fda in the united states to manufacture volumex for interstate commerce 
if this manufacturer were to cease filling the volumex syringes for daxor before the company had a chance to make alternative arrangements  the effect on daxor s operating revenue could be material 
regulatory risk or approvals there is a risk of delay until regulatory approvals are received for any new products the company may attempt to bring to market in the future 
at this point  management is unable to assess how long such a delay would be or the effect on sales that it could have

business overview daxor corporation is a medical device manufacturing company which provides additional biotechnology services  such as cryobanking and frozen blood storage  through its wholly owned subsidiary scientific medical systems corp 
the main focus of daxor corporation has been the development and marketing of the bva blood volume analyzer  an instrument that rapidly and accurately measures human blood volume 
this instrument is used in conjunction with a single use diagnostic injection and collection kit volumex that the company also sells to its customers 
recent developments blood volume derangements are associated with a variety of medical and surgical conditions 
it is well established that clinical assessments of blood volume using physical examination or simple blood tests are frequently inadequate to determine total blood volume 
daxor is therefore actively supporting blood volume research in several strategic areas including heart failure  critical care trauma  and transfusion decisions during surgery 
these therapeutic areas are ones in which patient diagnosis and or treatment may be greatly improved by the information obtained from a blood volume analysis  as outlined below 
heart failure heart failure  a major cause of morbidity and mortality among the elderly  is a serious public health problem 
expenditures related to the care of heart failure patients approach billion annually  which makes congestive heart failure the most expensive condition covered by medicare 
the majority of patients treated for heart failure must be treated with medications which produce drastic changes in their blood volumes 
daxor has previously sponsored several studies to assess the benefits of blood volume analysis in heart failure patients 
one landmark study  conducted by dr 
stuart katz when he was an investigator at the columbia presbyterian medical center  categorized patients as hypervolemic volume expanded  normovolemic having a normal blood volume  or hypovolemic volume contracted and recorded their outcomes over time 
at the end of one year  of the hypervolemic patients had died or received an urgent heart transplant 
in contrast  none of the normovolemic or hypovolemic patients died or received an urgent transplant 
at the end of two years  of hypervolemic patients had died or received an urgent heart transplant  while the normovolemic patients continued to have a mortality rate 
this study showed a remarkable correlation between blood volume and outcome and suggested that effectively treating patients to normovolemia may dramatically improve their outcomes 
this study also examined the accuracy of clinical assessment of volume status in these patients 
experienced cardiologists assessed patients blood volume status using standard laboratory tests and physical examination 
when choosing between three possible choices decreased  normal  or increased blood volume specialists were correct only of the time in categorizing these severely ill cardiac patients relative to the direct measurement results provided by the bva this study was cited in the american college of cardiology american heart association guidelines for the treatment of chronic heart failure in support of the recommendation to assess blood volume status of heart failure patients at every doctor s visit 
daxor has enrolled patients in a multi center study which is a follow up to this earlier study 
the team hf t reatment to e uvolemia normovolemia by a ssessment and m easured blood volume in h eart f ailure study will enroll a total of patients from thirteen participating medical centers 
the team hf study will compare heart failure management strategies based on clinical assessment of volume status versus direct measurement of blood volume using the bva to determine whether use of blood volume data leads to decreases in re hospitalization and mortality  and improved function and quality of life for heart failure patients 
dr 
stuart katz  who is now the director of the heart failure program at new york university  is extending his previous research by serving as the national principal investigator for this study 
data collection and management for the team hf study is being performed by an independent data collection center the nathan s 
kline institute for psychiatric research 
daxor has also retained the services of three statisticians  two of whom are faculty members at new york university  to assist with data analysis for the team hf study 
in addition  daxor is currently supporting a study which will determine whether use of blood volume measurement to help guide fluid removal by ultrafiltration uf in patients hospitalized with decompensated heart failure hf leads to improved outcomes 
the patients who enroll in this interventional study will undergo blood volume measurements immediately before uf  minutes after uf is complete  at day follow up and at day follow up 
patients will be randomized into two groups in the experimental group  the physician will be given the bva results  which in conjunction with continuous hematocrit monitoring will guide fluid removal during uf 
in the control group  the physician will not be given the bva results 
in this case  fluid removal will be based upon physicians clinical assessment 
some of the outcomes that will be compared between the two groups include survival  rehospitalization  the incidence of decreased kidney function  and the need for long term hemodialysis 
this study is currently in progress  and patients have enrolled to date 
daxor also provided support along with medtronic  inc for a clinical study to assess whether the optivol implantable cardiac device is able to provide an accurate estimate of patients blood volume status 
at the present time  it is difficult to accurately identify increases in blood volume that may predict which patients are likely to experience a worsening of symptoms and future heart failure events 
one invasive method that is sometimes used to identify early blood volume increases is medtronic s optivol system  which continuously monitors the thoracic fluid status of heart failure patients 
the objective of this study was to determine whether there is a correlation between intrathoracic bio impedance  as measured by medtronic s optivol system  and total blood and plasma volume as measured by daxor s non invasive bva blood volume analyzer 
this study was led by dr 
adrian van bakel  the medical director of the heart failure and cardiac transplant program of the medical university of south carolina 
the study was part of a larger study fast study of  patients 
the lead investigator was dr 
dj van veldhuisen 
the study  however  was prematurely terminated 
the reason for the termination was that patients treated on the basis of the optivol bio impedance monitor had a higher death rate 
the bio impedance monitor was essentially a surrogate measure of changes in the patient s blood volume or fluid congestion in the lungs 
with the exception of the study in south carolina  none of the other institutions used a blood volume measurement in evaluating the optivol instrument 
in reviewing the published reports and communicating with the senior investigator  dr 
feldschuh noted that the optivol instrument was never calibrated to the individual patient s blood volume 
there have been a number of recent communications with senior researchers at medtronic regarding the problem with the utilization of the optivol most likely stemming from the factthat there was no calibration of the patient s individual blood volume to the instrument 
in discussions with the company  dr 
feldschuh has expressed his opinion that if the instrument was calibrated by measuring a patient s actual blood volume  then it could be possible  on a daily basis  to monitor changes in blood volume in congestive heart failure patients 
these discussions have taken place over the past three months and are continuing 
critical care trauma optimal management of fluid status is an essential component of critical care medicine 
at the present time  physicians rely on imprecise clinical signs and symptoms to guide their fluid resuscitation decisions 
direct blood volume measurement can be used to take the guesswork out of volume assessment and to enable more precise and appropriate treatment 
dr 
mihae yu and colleagues at the queen s medical center in honolulu  hawaii  have been studying the use of blood volume measurement in the critical care unit 
they have performed blood volume measurement in the surgical intensive care unit and recorded how the results have influenced their treatment decisions 
some of their results were published in the february issue of the american journal of surgery 
the findings were based on blood volume measurements from patients  and showed that blood volume measurement results led to a change in treatment plan of the time 
among patients who received a pulmonary artery catheter pac for hemodynamic measurements  treatment would have been changed of the time if blood volume data had been available to treating physicians 
among patients who did not receive pac measurement  treatment would have changed of the time if the blood volume data had been available 
dr 
yu recently completed a major study  partially funded by daxor  in which blood volume measurement was conducted in the intensive care unit 
the purpose of the study was to determine whether survival and length of hospital stay could be improved by incorporating blood volume measurement into treatment decisions in the intensive care unit 
they found that use of the bva to guide fluid and red blood cell management led to a significant improvement in mortality in critically ill surgical patients with septic shock  severe sepsis  severe respiratory failure and or cardiovascular collapse 
patients in the control group  whose resuscitation was guided by findings from pulmonary artery catheterization pac demonstrated statistically significant untreated volume abnormalities and red blood cell deficiencies more often than patients in the group who were resuscitated based on blood volume measurement data vs 
and vs 
 respectively 
this correlated with significantly greater mortality for patients in the control group mortality than for patients in the blood volume measurement group mortality  p 
these findings indicate that blood volume analysis permits more accurate assessment of patients volume status and more precise fluid resuscitation and saves lives 
their most recent findings were published in the march issue of the journal shock 
daxor also supported a second study of blood volume analysis in critically injured trauma patients 
this study  which assessed blood volume changes over a three day period  was led by dr 
marty schreiber  chief of trauma at the oregon health and science university 
they found that the peripheral hematocrit which is traditionally used as a marker for blood loss does not provide an adequate estimate of red blood cell volume in critically ill patients who have been fluid resuscitated 
although the peripheral hematocrit was relatively accurate in patients with normal or contracted blood volumes  based on comparison to the results of direct blood volume measurement  it was quite inaccurate in patients with expanded blood volumes 
in fact  the peripheral hematocrit led to overdiagnosis of anemia in of critically ill patients with expanded blood volumes 
these findings were published in the march issue of the journal of trauma 
transfusion decisions during surgery effective volume management during surgery requires accurate assessment of a patient s need for transfusions 
the decision to transfuse a patient depends on appropriately balancing the benefits vs 
risks of transfusion for each patient at any given time 
blood volume measurement  by quantifying a patient s blood volume prior to surgery  can provide important information about how much blood loss a patient can safely sustain 
daxor recently sponsored a study of blood volume changes throughout cardiac surgery as measured by the bva this study was led by principal investigator dr 
mark nelson at the virginia commonwealth university 
three sequential blood volume analyses were conducted before surgery  immediately after surgery  and hours after transfer to the intensive care unit 
the hypothesis was that red cell volume would be well conserved as a result of cell salvage and transfusion practices employed in the operating room 
the preliminary findings from this study demonstrated a greater than anticipated loss of red cells and total blood volume during and after surgery 
these results were presented at the society of cardiovascular anesthesiologists meeting and are expected to be published in the future 
results of operations operating revenues for the year ended december   consolidated revenue from operations was  versus  for the year ended december  for a decrease of  or 
equipment sales and kit sales decreased from  in to  in in  the company did not sell any blood volume analyzers versus a sale of one for  versus one in revenue from service contracts on bva blood volume ananlyzers and related maintenance services increased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the revenue from kit sales decreased by for the year ended december  versus the same period in the number of kits sold decreased by for the year ended december  versus the same period in for the year ended december   the company sold  blood volume measurement kits versus  in for the year ended december   the company provided volumex doses free of charge to facilities utilizing the bva for research versus in the number of blood volume analyzers placed into service was at december  and at december  the decrease in revenue from kit sales in versus can be attributed to a decrease in visits by patients with the type of conditions that would require blood volume measurement to facilities utilizing the blood volume analyzer on a trial basis

research and development expenses for daxor and the bva segment decreased in by  or to  from  in the major reasons for this decrease were reductions in the year ended december  of  in salary and related expenses   in software development and  in laboratory expenses 
daxor remains committed to making blood volume analysis a standard of care in multiple disease conditions 
in order to help achieve this goal  the company filed a patent in the fourth quarter of for a semi automated instrument to measure total body albumin 
as a supplement to this application  the company filed two additional patents in march of for a semi automated instrument to measure human blood volume analysis 
the company is sponsoring a multi center study to compare heart failure management studies based on clinical assessment of volume status versus direct measurement of blood volume using the bva to determine whether use of blood volume data leads to decreases in re hospitalization and mortality  and improved function and quality of life for heart failure patients 
daxor is also currently supporting a study which will determine whether use of blood volume measurement to help guide fluid removal by ultrafiltration uf in patients with decompensated heart failure hf leads to improved outcomes

revenue  net of interest expense for the year ended december  decreased to billion from billion during the year ended december  on january   bank of america reported net income of billion for the year ended december  versus a net loss of billion for the same period in in order to be well capitalized under federal bank regulatory agency definitions  a bank holding company must have a tier capital ratio of at least  a total capital ratio of at least  and a leverage ratio of at least not to be subject to a federal reserve board directive to maintain higher capital levels 
at december   the tier capital ratio was  the total capital ratio was and the leverage ratio was 
bank of america is considered well capitalized under the federal regulatory agency definitions at december  after considering the available positive and negative evidence in addition to the ability of daxor to hold the stock until the market price exceeds our cost as it did at march   management has determined that an impairment charge is not necessary at december  on bank of america

critical accounting policies available for sale securities available for sale securities represent investments in debt and equity securities primarily common and preferred stock of utility companies that management has determined meet the definition of available for sale under fasb asc  investments 
accordingly  these investments are stated at fair market value and all unrealized holding gains or losses are recorded in the stockholders equity section as accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
conversely  all realized gains  losses and earnings are recorded in the statement of operations under other income expense 
the company will also engage in the short selling of stock 
when this occurs  the short position is marked to the market and this adjustment is recorded in the statement of operations 
any gain or loss is recorded for the period presented 
historical cost is used by the company to determine all gains and losses  and fair market value is obtained by readily available market quotes on all securities 
the company s investment goals  strategies and policies are as follows the company s investment goals are capital preservation  maintaining returns on capital with a high degree of safety and generating income from dividends and option sales to help offset operating losses 
in order to achieve these goals  the company maintains a diversified securities portfolio comprised primarily of electric utility common and preferred stocks 
the company also sells covered calls on portions of its portfolio and also sells puts on stocks it is willing to own 
it also sells uncovered calls and may have net short positions in common stock up to of the value of the portfolio 
the company s net short position may temporarily rise to of the company s portfolio without any specific action because of changes in valuation  but should not exceed this amount 
the company s investment policy is to maintain a minimum of of its portfolio in electric utilities 
the board of directors has authorized this minimum to be temporarily lowered to when company management deems it to be necessary 
investments in utilities are primarily in electric companies 
investments in non utility stocks will generally not exceed of the value of the portfolio 
investment in speculative issues  including short sales  maximum of 
limited use of options to increase yearly investment income 
a 
the use of call options 
covered options can be sold up to a maximum of of the value of the portfolio 
this provides extra income in addition to dividends received from the company s investments 
the risk of this strategy is that investments may be called away  which the company may have preferred to retain 
therefore  a limitation of is placed on the amount of stock on which options can be written 
the amount of the portfolio on which options are actually written is usually between of the portfolio 
the historical turnover of the portfolio is such that the average holding period is in excess of five years for available for sale securities 
b 
the use of put options 
put options are written on stocks which the company is willing to purchase 
while the company does not have a high rate of turnover in its portfolio  there is some turnover  for example  due to preferred stocks being called back by the issuing company  or stocks being called away because call options have been written 
if the stock does not go below the put exercise price  the company records the proceeds from the sale as income 
if the put is exercised  the cost basis is reduced by the proceeds received from the sale of the put option 
there may be occasions where the cost basis of the stock is lower than the market price at the time the option is exercised 
c 
speculative short sales short options 
the company normally limits its speculative transactions to no more than of the value of the portfolio 
the company may sell uncovered calls on certain stocks 
if the stock price does not rise to the price of the call  the option is not exercised and the company records the proceeds from the sale of the call as income 
if the call is exercised  the company will have a short position in the related stock 
the company then has the choice of covering the short position  or selling a put against it 
if the put is exercised  then the short position is covered 
the company s current accounting policy is to mark to the market at the end of each quarter any short positions  and include it in the income statement 
while the company may have so called speculative positions equal to of its accounts  in actual practice the net short stock positions usually account for less than of the assets of the company 
in the event of a merger  the company will elect to receive shares in the new company if this is an option 
if the proposed merger is a cash only offer  the company will receive cash and be forced to sell the stock 
our investment policy calls for a minimum of of the value of our portfolio of available for sale securities to be maintained in utility stocks 
operating under this policy  management s investment strategy is to purchase utility stocks which it considers to be undervalued relative to the market in anticipation of an increase in the market price 
it is possible that the market value of a stock may go below our cost after we purchase it even though we considered the stock to be undervalued relative to the market at the time we purchased it 
when that occurs  we follow the provisions of sec staff accounting bulletin codification of staff accounting bulletins  topic m sab m miscellaneous accounting  other than temporary investments in debt and equity securities in determining whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired 
the factors we review and or consider include the following the extent to which the market value has been less than cost 
an evaluation of the financial condition of an issuer including a review of their profit and loss statements for the most recent completed fiscal year and the preceding two years 
the examination of the general market outlook of the issuer 
this could include but is not limited to the issuer having a unique product or technology which would appear likely to have a positive impact on future earnings 
a review of the general market conditions 
our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for the anticipated recovery in market value
