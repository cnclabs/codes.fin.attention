back to contents overview of results summarized below are the key highlights for for additional information  see the remaining sections of this md a  which discuss both consolidated and segment results in more detail 
key consolidated financial data dollars in millions revenues medical membership in thousands shareholders income from continuing operations adjusted income from operations cash flows from operating activities shareholders equity includes medical members of the company s health care segment as well as the international health care business  including global health benefits 
for a definition of adjusted income from operations  see the consolidated results of operations section of this md a beginning on page consolidated results of operations revenues rose in  reflecting solid growth in the company s strategically targeted domestic and international customer segments of its ongoing health care  disability and life  and international businesses 
in addition  the increase in revenue reflects the effect of the programs to hedge equity and growth interest rate exposures in the run off reinsurance operations 
see the run off reinsurance section of this md a beginning on page for additional information 
these increases were partially offset by the exit from certain non strategic markets  primarily the medicare advantage individual private fee for service medicare ipffs business 
medical membership increased  reflecting growth in targeted markets  primarily the middle and select market segments domestically as well as growth in the global health benefits business 
these increases were partially offset by exits from certain non strategic markets  primarily medicare ipffs 
shareholders income from continuing operations decreased in  reflecting higher losses in the gmib business substantially offset by higher overall earnings from the company s ongoing businesses 
adjusted income from operations increased in  continuing to demonstrate the value of the company s diversified portfolio of businesses  resulting in strong earnings contributions from each of the company s ongoing businesses 
these results were achieved primarily as a result of continued growth  effective execution of the company s business strategy and low medical services utilization trend in the health care business 
cash flows from operating activities in reflected the strong earnings contributions from the ongoing businesses  partially offset by pension plan contributions and claim run out from the medicare ipffs business 
liquidity and financial condition during  the company entered into several transactions to strengthen its liquidity and financial condition as well as to strategically deploy its capital as follows entered into an agreement to acquire healthspring  inc healthspring for approximately billion in cash and cigna stock awards 
the transaction closed on january   the healthspring acquisition was financed in part by the issuance of billion of debt and million shares of common stock for million million  net of underwriting discount and fees in the fourth quarter of as a result of these transactions  cash at the parent company was approximately billion at december   acquired firstassist for approximately million in the fourth quarter of  contributed million to its domestic qualified pension plans  repurchased million shares of stock for million  and entered into a new five year revolving credit and letter of credit agreement for billion  that permits up to million to be used for letters of credit 
the credit agreement includes options to increase the commitment amount to billion and to extend the term past june cigna corporation form k 
back to contents shareholders equity increased substantially during  reflecting strong shareholders net income  increased invested asset values primarily fixed maturities reflecting lower market yields largely due to lower interest rates  and the impact of the fourth quarter common stock issuance 
those favorable items were partially offset by the unfavorable effects of the pension plan liability on shareholders equity due to a basis point decline in the discount rate and lower than expected asset returns

for further discussion of the company s actions to manage its balance sheet exposures  see the section on run off operations discussed below 
key to the company s strategy is effectively deploying capital in pursuing additional opportunities in high growth markets 
consistent with this objective  cigna achieved a significant milestone with the acquisition of healthspring  inc in january healthspring  a leading provider of medical benefits to the population through the medicare advantage program  strengthens cigna s ability to serve individuals across their life stages as well as deepens cigna s presence in a number of geographic markets

back to contents in addition to the company specific factors cited above  overall results are influenced by a range of economic and other factors  especially cost trends and inflation for medical and related services  utilization patterns of medical and other services  employment levels  the tort liability system  developments in the political environment both domestically and internationally  including us health care reform  interest rates  equity market returns  foreign currency fluctuations and credit market volatility  including the availability and cost of credit in the future  and federal  state and international regulation 
the company regularly monitors the trends impacting operating results from the above mentioned key factors to appropriately respond to economic and other factors affecting its operations  both in its ongoing and run off operations 
run off operations the company s run off reinsurance operations have significant exposures  primarily from its guaranteed minimum death benefits gmdb  also known as vadbe and guaranteed minimum income benefits gmib products 
as part of its strategy to effectively manage these exposures  the company operates an equity hedge program to substantially reduce the impact of equity market movements on the liability for the gmdb business 
in february  the company implemented additional hedges designed to offset a portion of the equity market risk for gmib contracts and a portion of the interest rate risks related to gmdb and gmib contracts 
the company actively monitors the performance of and will continue to evaluate further adjustments for these hedging programs 
these products are also influenced by a range of economic and behavioral factors that were not hedged or only partially hedged as of december   including a portion of equity market risk for gmib contracts  a portion of interest rate risks  future partial surrender impacts for gmdb contracts  including equity market risk and election rates  annuity election rates for gmib contracts  mortality and lapse rates  and the collection of amounts recoverable from retrocessionaires 
in order to manage these factors  the company actively studies policyholder behavior experience and adjusts future expectations based on the results of the studies  as warranted  actively monitors the hedging programs and will continue to evaluate further adjustments to the hedging programs  performs regular audits of ceding companies to ensure compliance with agreements as well as to help maximize the collection of receivables from retrocessionaires  and monitors the financial strength and credit standing of its retrocessionaires and establishes or collects collateral when warranted 
in the first quarter of  the company contributed million to its subsidiary  cigna arbor life insurance company arbor 
with the impact of declining interest rates during  arbor s statutory surplus at december  was approximately million  which remains in excess of minimum risk based capital requirements and the company s internal guidelines 
cigna corporation form k 
back to contents health care reform in the first quarter of  the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act health care reform were signed into law 
certain of the law s provisions that affected the company became effective during and and others will take effect from to commercial minimum medical loss ratio requirements became effective in january  requiring payment of premium rebates beginning in to employers and customers covered under the company s comprehensive commercial medical insurance if certain annual minimum loss ratios mlr are not met 
the company recorded its rebate accrual based on estimated medical loss ratios calculated as prescribed by health care reform using full year premium and claim information by state and market segment for each legal entity that issues comprehensive medical insurance 
for the year ended december   the company accrued an estimated rebate of million pre tax million after tax 
in  the department of health and human services hhs provided a special methodology for calculating the mlr for limited benefit and global health benefit plans 
this special methodology  which resulted in no premium rebates being due in for these businesses  has been extended through for limited benefit plans and indefinitely for global health benefit plans 
health care reform also changed tax laws related to certain future retiree benefit and compensation related payments earned after that resulted in after tax charges of approximately million in and million in in addition  the company incurred after tax costs of approximately million in and million in related to health care reform to build the infrastructure necessary to comply with the provisions of health care reform that became effective in these costs represent the estimated cost of internal staff redeployed to work on health care reform initiatives 
certain fees  including the annual health insurer fee  become effective in and for cigna and others to help fund the additional insurance benefits and coverages provided by this legislation 
payment of these fees will result in charges to the company s financial results in future periods 
in addition  since these fees will generally not be tax deductible  the company s effective tax rate is expected to be adversely impacted in future periods 
however  the company is unable to estimate the amount of these fees or the impact on the effective tax rate because guidance for these calculations has not been finalized 
health care reform also impacts cigna s medicare advantage and medicare part d prescription drug plan businesses acquired with healthspring in a variety of additional ways  including reduced medicare premium rates which began with the contract year  transition of medicare advantage benchmark rates to medicare fee for service parity  reduced enrollment periods and limitations on disenrollment  and providing quality bonuses for medicare advantage plans with a rating for four or five stars from cms 
funding for medicare advantage plans has been and may continue to be altered by federal legislation 
management is currently unable to estimate the full impact of health care reform on the company s future results of operations  and its financial condition and liquidity due to uncertainties related to interpretation  implementation and timing of its many provisions 
it is possible  however  that this impact could be material to future results of operations 
the company s strengths and the capabilities of its broad health and wellness portfolio are expected to help leverage potential business opportunities resulting from health care reform 
management  through its internal task force  continues to closely monitor implementation of the law  report on the company s compliance with health care reform  actively engage with regulators to assist with the ongoing conversion of legislation to regulation and assess potential opportunities arising from health care reform 
for additional information regarding health care reform  see the regulation section beginning on page of this form k 
acquisitions and dispositions in line with its growth strategy  the company has strengthened its market position and reduced balance sheet exposures through the following acquisition and disposition transactions 
acquisition of healthspring  inc on january   the company acquired all of the outstanding shares of healthspring  inc healthspring for per share in cash and cigna stock awards  representing an estimated cost of approximately billion 
healthspring provides medicare advantage coverage in states and the district of columbia as well as a large  national stand alone medicare prescription drug business 
the company funded the acquisition with internal cash resources that included billion of additional debt  approximately million of new equity million net of underwriting discount and fees issued during the fourth quarter of and net proceeds from its issuance of commercial paper 
cigna corporation form k 
back to contents acquisition of firstassist on november   the company acquired firstassist group holdings limited firstassist for approximately million 
firstassist is based in the united kingdom  uk and provides travel and protection insurance services that the company expects will enhance its supplemental health  life and accident business around the world 
the company used available cash on hand for the purchase 
reinsurance of run off workers compensation and personal accident business on december   the company essentially exited from its workers compensation and personal accident reinsurance business by purchasing retrocessional coverage from a bermuda subsidiary of enstar group limited and transferring administration of this business to the reinsurer 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
sale of workers compensation and case management business on december  the company completed the sale of its workers compensation and case management business to genex holdings  inc the company recognized an after tax gain on sale of million million before tax which was reported in other revenues in the disability and life segment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
acquisition of vanbreda international on august   the company acquired of the voting stock of vanbreda international nv vanbreda international  based in antwerp  belgium for a cash purchase price of million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about the acquisition of vanbreda international 
new accounting pronouncement deferred acquisition cost as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company will implement the new requirements of asu related to deferred acquisition costs on january  through retrospective adjustment of prior periods 
the company s deferred acquisition costs arise from sales and renewal activities primarily in its international segment 
because the new requirements further restrict the types of costs that are deferrable  more of the company s acquisition costs will be expensed as incurred 
the company expects the cumulative effect of implementing this new guidance to decrease shareholders equity as of january  by approximately million to million 
in addition  as a result of acquisition costs no longer eligible for deferral under the new guidance  the company expects that full year shareholders net income on a retrospectively adjusted basis will decrease by approximately million 
the reduction will primarily occur in the company s international segment 
the effect of the new guidance on shareholders net income in is expected to be generally comparable to that estimated for implementation of this new guidance will have no impact on the underlying economic value  revenues or cash flows of the company s businesses  nor will it impact the company s liquidity or the statutory surplus of its insurance subsidiaries

back to contents consolidated results of operations the company measures the financial results of its segments using segment earnings loss  which is defined as shareholders income loss from continuing operations before after tax realized investment results 
adjusted income from operations is defined as consolidated segment earnings loss excluding special items defined below and the results of the gmib business 
adjusted income from operations is another measure of profitability used by the company s management because it presents the underlying results of operations of the company s businesses and permits analysis of trends in underlying revenue  expenses and shareholders net income 
this measure is not determined in accordance with gaap and should not be viewed as a substitute for the most directly comparable gaap measure  which is shareholders income from continuing operations

back to contents overview of consolidated results of operations shareholders income from continuing operations decreased in compared with  due to significantly higher gmib losses principally reflecting lower interest rates  substantially offset by higher adjusted income from operations as explained further below 
see the run off reinsurance section of the md a beginning on page for additional information on gmib results 
adjusted income from operations increased in compared with primarily due to higher earnings contributions from the company s health care and international segments 
these results reflect solid business growth in strategically targeted markets and continued low medical services utilization trend 
see the individual segment sections of this md a for further discussion 
overview of consolidated results of operations shareholders income from continuing operations increased in compared with  reflecting strong growth in adjusted income from operations as well as significant improvement in realized investment results  partially offset by a loss in the gmib business in compared with a significant gain in adjusted income from operations increased in compared with primarily due to strong earnings growth in the ongoing business segments health care  disability and life and international  reflecting focused execution of the company s strategy  which includes a growing global customer base as well as higher net investment income reflecting improved economic conditions and asset growth 
special items and gmib management does not believe that the special items noted in the table above are representative of the company s underlying results of operations 
accordingly  the company excluded these special items from adjusted income from operations in order to facilitate an understanding and comparison of results of operations and permit analysis of trends in underlying revenue  expenses and shareholders income from continuing operations 
special items for included after tax costs incurred in the fourth quarter of associated with the january acquisition of healthspring and the november acquisition of firstassist  and tax benefits associated with the completion of the and irs examinations see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding this special item 
special items for included a gain resulting from the resolution of a federal income tax matter  consisting of a million release of a deferred tax valuation allowance and million of accrued interest 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information  a loss on the extinguishment of debt resulting from the decision of certain holders of the company s notes due and notes due to accept the company s tender offer to redeem these notes for cash 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information  and a loss on reinsurance of the run off workers compensation and personal accident reinsurance businesses to enstar 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
special items for included a curtailment gain resulting from the decision to freeze the pension plan see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information  cost reduction charges related to the cost reduction program  and benefits resulting from the completion of the and irs examinations see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the company also excludes the results of the gmib business  including the results of the related hedges starting in  from adjusted income from operations because the fair value of gmib assets and liabilities must be recalculated each quarter using updated capital market assumptions 
the resulting changes in fair value  which are reported in shareholders net income  are volatile and unpredictable 
see the critical accounting estimates section of the md a beginning on page of the company s form k for more information on the effects of capital market assumption changes on shareholders net income 
because of this volatility  and since the gmib business is in run off  management does not believe that its results are meaningful in assessing underlying results of operations 
cigna corporation form k 
back to contents outlook for the company expects consolidated adjusted income from operations to be higher than results 
this outlook reflects strong organic growth  an expected increase in medical services utilization and contributions from the healthspring acquisition 
this outlook assumes break even results for gmdb also known as vadbe for  which assumes that actual experience  including capital market performance  will be consistent with long term reserve assumptions 
see note to the consolidated financial statements as well as the critical accounting estimates section of the md a beginning on page of the form k for more information on the effects of capital market and other reserve assumption changes on shareholders net income 
information is not available for management to reasonably estimate the future results of the gmib business or realized investment results due in part to interest rate and stock market volatility and other internal and external factors 
in addition  the company is not able to identify or reasonably estimate the financial impact of special items in  however they will include potential adjustments associated with healthspring  inc acquisition costs  and may include litigation and assessment related items 
the company s outlook for is subject to the factors cited above and in the cautionary statement beginning on page of this form k and the sensitivities discussed in the critical accounting estimates section of the md a beginning on page of this form k 
if unfavorable equity market and interest rate movements occur  the company could experience losses related to investment impairments and the gmib and gmdb businesses 
these losses could adversely impact the company s consolidated results of operations and financial condition and liquidity by potentially reducing the capital of the company s insurance subsidiaries and reducing their dividend paying capabilities 
revenues total revenues increased by in  compared with  and in compared with changes in the components of total revenue are described more fully below

back to contents other revenues other revenues included pre tax losses of million in compared with million in and million in related to futures and swaps entered into as part of a dynamic hedge program to manage equity and growth interest rate risks in the company s run off reinsurance operations 
see the run off reinsurance section of the md a beginning on page for more information on this program 
excluding the impact of these swaps and futures contracts  other revenues declined in  compared with the decline primarily reflects the absence of revenue in from the workers compensation and case management business  which was sold in as well as lower revenues in from cigna government services  which was sold in the second quarter of excluding the impact of the futures contracts associated with the gmdb equity hedge program  other revenues increased in  compared with primarily reflecting the pre tax gain on the sale of the workers compensation and case management business of million 
realized investment results realized investment results in were lower than in primarily due to higher impairment losses on fixed maturities and valuation declines on hybrid securities  partially offset by higher gains on sales of real estate properties held in joint ventures 
realized investment results in were significantly higher than in primarily due to lower impairments on fixed maturities and real estate funds in  increased prepayment fees on fixed maturities received in as a result of favorable market conditions and issuer specific business circumstances  and gains on sales of real estate held in joint ventures and other investments in these favorable effects were partially offset by an increase in commercial mortgage loan impairments recorded in  reflecting continued weakness in the commercial real estate market

back to contents critical accounting estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material effect on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the company s board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures presented below 
in addition to the estimates presented in the following table  there are other accounting estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements  including estimates of liabilities for future policy benefits other than those identified in the following table  as well as estimates with respect to goodwill  unpaid claims and claim expenses  postemployment and postretirement benefits other than pensions  certain compensation accruals  and income taxes 
management believes the current assumptions used to estimate amounts reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements are appropriate 
however  if actual experience differs from the assumptions used in estimating amounts reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated results of operations  and in certain situations  could have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity and financial condition 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on significant accounting policies that impact the company 
balance sheet caption nature of critical accounting estimate effect if different assumptions used future policy benefits guaranteed minimum death benefits gmdb also known as vadbe these liabilities are estimates of the present value of net amounts expected to be paid  less the present value of net future premiums expected to be received 
the amounts to be paid represent the excess of the guaranteed death benefit over the values of contractholders accounts 
the death benefit coverage in force at december  representing the amount payable if all of approximately  contractholders had submitted death claims as of that date was approximately billion 
liabilities for future policy benefits for these contracts as of december were as follows in millions current assumptions and methods used to estimate these liabilities are detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
based on current and historical market  industry and company specific experience and management s judgment  the company believes that it is reasonably likely that the unfavorable changes in the key assumptions and or conditions described below could occur 
if these unfavorable assumption changes were to occur  the approximate after tax decrease in shareholders net income would be as follows increase in claim mortality rates million decrease in lapse rates million increase in election rates for future partial surrenders million basis point decrease in interest rates unhedged mean investment performance million discount rate million increase in volatility million as of december   if contractholder account values invested in underlying equity mutual funds declined by due to equity market performance  the after tax decrease in shareholders net income resulting from an increase in the unhedged provision for partial surrenders would be approximately million 
as of december   if contractholder account values invested in underlying bond money market mutual funds declined by due to bond money market performance  the after tax decrease in shareholders net income resulting from an increase in the provision for partial surrenders and an increase in unhedged exposure would be approximately million 
the amounts would be reflected in the run off reinsurance segment

back to contents balance sheet caption nature of critical accounting estimate effect if different assumptions used accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities  and other assets  including other intangibles guaranteed minimum income benefits these net liabilities are calculated with an internal model using many scenarios to determine the fair value of amounts estimated to be paid  less the fair value of net future premiums estimated to be received  adjusted for risk and profit charges that the company anticipates a hypothetical market participant would require to assume this business 
the amounts estimated to be paid represent the excess of the anticipated value of the income benefit over the value of the annuitants accounts at the time of annuitization 
the assets associated with these contracts represent receivables in connection with reinsurance that the company has purchased from two external reinsurers  which covers of the exposures on these contracts 
liabilities related to these contracts as of december  were as follows in millions as of december  estimated amounts receivable related to these contracts from two external reinsurers  were as follows in millions current assumptions and methods used to estimate these liabilities are detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s results of operations are expected to be volatile in future periods because most capital market assumptions will be based largely on market observable inputs at the close of each period including interest rates and market implied volatilities 
based on current and historical market  industry and company specific experience and management s judgment  the company believes that it is reasonably likely that the unfavorable changes in the key assumptions and or conditions described below could occur 
if these unfavorable assumption changes were to occur  the approximate after tax decrease in shareholders net income  net of estimated amounts receivable from reinsurers  would be as follows basis point decrease in interest rates rates aligned with libor used for projecting market returns and discounting  net of the impact of hedging programs million basis point decrease in interest rates used for projecting claim exposure year treasury rates million increase in volatility million decrease in mortality million increase in annuity election rates million decrease in lapse rates million increase to the risk and profit charges million market declines expose the company to a larger net liability 
decreases in annuitants account values resulting from a equity market decline could decrease shareholders net income by approximately million  net of the impact of hedging programs 
decreases in annuitants account values resulting from a decline due to bond money market performance could decrease shareholders net income by approximately million 
if credit default swap spreads used to evaluate the nonperformance risk of the company were to narrow or the credit rating of its principal life insurance subsidiary were to improve  it would cause a decrease in the discount rate of the gmib liability  resulting in an unfavorable impact to earnings 
if the discount rate decreased by basis points due to this  the decrease in shareholders net income would be approximately million 
if credit default swap spreads used to evaluate the nonperformance risk of the company s gmib retrocessionaires were to widen or the retrocessionaires credit ratings were to weaken  it would cause an increase in the discount rate of the gmib asset  resulting in an unfavorable impact to earnings 
if the discount rate increased by basis points due to this  the decrease in shareholders net income would be approximately million 
all of these estimated impacts due to unfavorable changes in assumptions and or conditions could vary from quarter to quarter depending on actual reserve levels  the actual market conditions or changes in the anticipated view of a hypothetical market participant as of any future valuation date 
the amounts would be reflected in the run off reinsurance segment

back to contents balance sheet caption nature of critical accounting estimate effect if different assumptions used accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities pension liabilities these liabilities are estimates of the present value of the qualified and nonqualified pension benefits to be paid attributed to employee service to date net of the fair value of plan assets 
the accrued pension benefit liability as of december was as follows in millions see note to the consolidated financial statements for assumptions and methods used to estimate pension liabilities 
using past experience  the company expects that it is reasonably possible that a favorable or unfavorable change in assumptions for the discount rate or expected return on plan assets of basis points could occur 
an unfavorable change is a decrease in these key assumptions with resulting impacts as discussed below 
if discount rates for the qualified and nonqualified pension plans decreased by basis points annual pension costs for would decrease by approximately million  after tax  and the accrued pension benefit liability would increase by approximately million as of december  resulting in an after tax decrease to shareholders equity of approximately million as of december  if the expected long term return on domestic qualified pension plan assets decreased by basis points  annual pension costs for would increase by approximately million after tax 
if the company used the market value of assets to measure pension costs as opposed to the market related value  annual pension cost for would increase by approximately million after tax 
if the december  fair values of domestic qualified plan assets decreased by  the accrued pension benefit liability would increase by approximately million as of december  resulting in an after tax decrease to shareholders equity of approximately million 
an increase in these key assumptions would result in impacts to annual pension costs  the accrued pension liability and shareholders equity in an opposite direction  but similar amounts 
health care medical claims payable medical claims payable for the health care segment include both reported claims and estimates for losses incurred but not yet reported 
liabilities for medical claims payable as of december were as follows in millions gross  net gross  net  these liabilities are presented above both gross and net of reinsurance and other recoverables and generally exclude amounts for administrative services only business 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding assumptions and methods used to estimate this liability 
in  actual experience differed from the company s key assumptions as of december   resulting in million of favorable incurred claims related to prior years medical claims payable or of the current year incurred claims as reported in in  actual experience differed from the company s key assumptions as of december   resulting in million of favorable incurred claims related to prior years medical claims  or of the current year incurred claims reported in specifically  the favorable impact is due to faster than expected completion factors and lower than expected medical cost trends  both of which included an assumption for moderately adverse experience 
the impact of this favorable prior year development was an increase to shareholders net income of million after tax million pre tax in the change in the amount of the incurred claims related to prior years in the medical claims payable liability does not directly correspond to an increase or decrease in shareholders net income as explained in note to the consolidated financial statements

back to contents balance sheet caption nature of critical accounting estimate effect if different assumptions used valuation of fixed maturity investments fixed maturities are primarily classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss within shareholders equity 
fair value is defined as the price at which an asset could be exchanged in an orderly transaction between market participants at the balance sheet date 
the determination of fair value for a financial instrument requires management judgment 
the degree of judgment involved generally correlates to the level of pricing readily observable in the markets 
financial instruments with quoted prices in active markets or with market observable inputs to determine fair value  such as public securities  generally require less judgment 
conversely  private placements including more complex securities that are traded infrequently are typically measured using pricing models that require more judgment as to the inputs and assumptions used to estimate fair value 
there may be a number of alternative inputs to select  based on an understanding of the issuer  the structure of the security and overall market conditions 
in addition  these factors are inherently variable in nature as they change frequently in response to market conditions 
approximately two thirds of the company s fixed maturities are public securities  and one third are private placement securities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the company s fair value measurements and the procedures performed by management to determine that the amounts represent appropriate estimates 
assessment of other than temporary impairments of fixed maturities to determine whether a fixed maturity s decline in fair value below its amortized cost is other than temporary  the company must evaluate the expected recovery in value and its intent to sell or the likelihood of a required sale of the fixed maturity prior to an expected recovery 
to make this determination  the company considers a number of general and specific factors including the regulatory  economic and market environment  length of time and severity of the decline  and the financial health and specific near term prospects of the issuer 
see notes c and to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the company s review of declines in fair value  including information regarding the company s accounting policies for fixed maturities 
typically  the most significant input in the measurement of fair value is the market interest rate used to discount the estimated future cash flows from the instrument 
such market rates are derived by calculating the appropriate spreads over comparable us treasury securities  based on the credit quality  industry and structure of the asset 
if the spreads used to calculate fair value changed by basis points  the fair value of the total fixed maturity portfolio of billion would change by approximately billion 
for all fixed maturities with cost in excess of their fair value  if this excess was determined to be other than temporary  shareholders net income for the year ended december  would have decreased by approximately million after tax

back to contents segment reporting operating segments generally reflect groups of related products  but the international segment is generally based on geography 
the company measures the financial results of its segments using segment earnings loss  which is defined as shareholders income loss from continuing operations excluding after tax realized investment gains and losses 
adjusted income from operations for each segment is defined as segment earnings excluding special items and the results of the company s gmib business 
adjusted income from operations is another measure of profitability used by the company s management because it presents the underlying results of operations of the segment and permits analysis of trends 
this measure is not determined in accordance with gaap and should not be viewed as a substitute for the most directly comparable gaap measure  which is segment earnings

back to contents other operating expenses 
one measure of the segment s overall operating efficiency is the operating expense ratio calculated as total operating expenses divided by segment revenues 
this measure can be significantly influenced by the mix of business between fully insured and fee based business  since the expense ratio on fee based business  which comprises most of the segment s business is higher than the corresponding ratio for fully insured business 
the ratio is also influenced by the level of fixed versus variable expenses 
the segment s variable expenses include premium taxes and commissions  while the fixed component consists primarily of infrastructure costs and certain strategic investments 
the variable component fluctuates due to changes in revenue  mix of business  and other items 
excluding the impact of the medicare ipffs business  the operating expense ratio improved from in to in  driven largely by continued focus on expense management 
on a reported basis  the operating expense ratio increased from in to in primarily driven by a change in business mix resulting from the company s decision to exit the non strategic medicare ipffs business  that was a fully insured business 
because fully insured businesses collect premium revenue compared with a relatively lower administrative fee for aso business  they typically have a lower expense ratio than the company s current business mix that is more heavily weighted toward fee based products 
excluding the impact of the medicare ipffs business  the operating expense ratio improved from in to in  driven largely by continued focus on cost reduction initiatives including staffing  real estate and pension changes  as well as strong revenue growth in the commercial risk businesses 
these favorable effects were partially offset by investment in segment expansion  compliance and higher management incentive compensation 
on a reported basis  the operating expense ratio decreased from in to in primarily due to the significant revenue growth in the medicare ipffs business in since medicare ipffs was a fully insured business  it had a lower expense ratio than the business mix in that was more heavily weighted toward fee based products

the components were as follows in millions gmdb equity hedge program gmdb growth interest rate hedge program other  including gmib hedge programs total other revenues the hedging programs generally produce losses when equity markets and interest rates are rising and gains when equity markets and interest rates are falling

benefits and expenses benefits and expenses were comprised of the following in millions gmib fair value gain loss other benefits and expenses benefits and expenses gmib fair value gain loss 
under the gaap guidance for fair value measurements  the company s results of operations are expected to be volatile in future periods because capital market assumptions needed to estimate the assets and liabilities for the gmib business are based largely on market observable inputs at the close of each reporting period including interest rates libor swap curve and market implied volatilities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about assumptions and asset and liability balances related to gmib 
gmib fair value losses of million for  were primarily due to a decline in both the interest rate used for projecting claim exposure year treasury rates and the rate used for projecting market returns and discounting libor swap curve 
gmib fair value losses of million for  were primarily due to declining interest rates  partially offset by increases in underlying account values resulting from favorable equity and bond fund returns 
gmib fair value gains of million for  were primarily due to increases in interest rates and increases in underlying account values in the period resulting from favorable equity market and bond fund returns 
these favorable effects were partially offset by increases to the annuitization assumption and updates to the lapse assumptions 
the gmib liabilities and related assets are calculated using an internal model and assumptions from the viewpoint of a hypothetical market participant 
this resulting liability and related asset is higher than the company believes will ultimately be required to settle claims primarily because the company does not believe that the market observable interest rates used to project growth in account values of the underlying mutual funds reflect actual growth expected over the next to years the time period over which gmib claims are expected to occur 
however  the company s expectation that gmib claim payments will be lower than the liability recorded at fair value may not be fully realized under certain circumstances 
for example  significant declines in mutual fund values that underlie the contracts together with declines in the year treasury rates used to determine claim payments similar to what occurred periodically during the last few years would increase the expected amount of claims that would be paid out for contractholders who choose to annuitize 
it is also possible that such unfavorable market conditions would have an impact on the level of contractholder annuitizations  particularly if these unfavorable market conditions persisted for an extended period

as explained in other revenues above  these changes do not affect shareholders net income because they are offset by gains or losses on futures contracts used to hedge equity market performance 
gmdb reserve strengthening the following highlights the impacts of gmdb reserve strengthening the reserve strengthening was primarily driven by adverse impacts due to volatile equity market conditions 
volatility risk is not covered by the hedging programs 
also  the equity market volatility reduced the effectiveness of the hedging program for equity market exposures  in part because the market does not offer futures contracts that exactly match the diverse mix of equity fund investments held by contractholders 
adverse interest rate impacts reflecting management s consideration of the anticipated impact of continuing low current short term interest rates 
this evaluation also led management to lower the mean investment performance assumption for equity funds from to for those funds not subject to the growth interest rate hedge program 
adverse impacts of overall market declines in the third quarter of that include an increase in the provision for expected future partial surrenders and declines in the value of contractholders non equity investments such as bond funds  neither of which are included in the hedge programs 
the reserve strengthening primarily reflects management s consideration of the anticipated impact of the continued low level of current short term interest rates and  to a lesser extent  a reduction in assumed lapse rates for policies that have taken or are assumed to take significant partial withdrawals 
the reserve strengthening was primarily due to an increase in the provision for future partial surrenders due to overall market declines in the first quarter  adverse volatility related impacts due to turbulent equity market conditions and adverse interest rate impacts 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about assumptions and reserve balances related to gmdb 
other  including operating expenses the increase in compared with was due to the reduced favorable impacts of reserve studies  and the increase in compared to was due to the reduced impact of favorable settlements and commutations on business that was ceded to enstar group limited on december  cigna corporation form k 
back to contents segment summary the company s payment obligations for underlying reinsurance exposures assumed by the company under these contracts are based on ceding companies claim payments 
for gmdb and gmib  claim payments vary because of changes in equity markets and interest rates  as well as mortality and policyholder behavior 
any of these claim payments can extend many years into the future  and the amount of the ceding companies ultimate claims  and therefore the amount of the company s ultimate payment obligations and corresponding ultimate collection from retrocessionaires may not be known with certainty for some time 
the company s reserves for underlying reinsurance exposures assumed by the company  as well as for amounts recoverable from retrocessionaires  are considered appropriate as of december   based on current information 
however  it is possible that future developments  which could include but are not limited to worse than expected claim experience and higher than expected volatility  could have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
the company bears the risk of loss if its payment obligations to cedents increase or if its retrocessionaires are unable to meet  or successfully challenge  their reinsurance obligations to the company

in  the parent company s cash obligations are expected to consist of the following acquisition of healthspring for approximately billion  scheduled interest payments of million on outstanding long term debt of billion at december   contributions to the domestic qualified pension plan of million  and approximately million of commercial paper outstanding as of december  the company expects to have approximately million outstanding as of march  based on cash on hand  current projections for dividends from the company s subsidiaries  as well as its ability to issue additional commercial paper  debt or equity securities in the capital markets  the company expects to have sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations 
however  the company s cash projections may not be realized and the demand for funds could exceed available cash if ongoing businesses experience unexpected shortfalls in earnings  regulatory restrictions or rating agency capital guidelines reduce the amount of dividends available to be distributed to the parent company from the insurance and hmo subsidiaries including the impact of equity market deterioration and volatility on subsidiary capital  significant disruption or volatility in the capital and credit markets reduces the company s ability to raise capital or creates unexpected losses related to the gmdb and gmib businesses  a substantial increase in funding over current projections is required for the company s pension plan  or a substantial increase in funding is required for the company s gmdb and gmib equity and interest rate hedge programs 
in those cases  the company expects to have the flexibility to satisfy liquidity needs through a variety of measures  including intercompany borrowings and sales of liquid investments 
the parent company may borrow up to million from cglic without prior state approval 
in addition  the company may use short term borrowings  such as the commercial paper program and the committed line of credit agreement of up to billion subject to the maximum debt leverage covenant in its line of credit agreement 
as of december   the company had billion of borrowing capacity under the credit agreement  reflecting million of letters of credit issued as of december  within the maximum debt leverage covenant in the line of credit agreement  the company has approximately billion of additional borrowing capacity in addition to the billion of debt outstanding 
though the company believes it has adequate sources of liquidity  significant disruption or volatility in the capital and credit markets could affect the company s ability to access those markets for additional borrowings or increase costs associated with borrowing funds 
solvency regulation many states have adopted some form of the national association of insurance commissioners naic model solvency related laws and risk based capital rules rbc rules for life and health insurance companies 
the rbc rules recommend a minimum level of capital depending on the types and quality of investments held  the types of business written and the types of liabilities incurred 
if the ratio of the insurer s adjusted surplus to its risk based capital falls below statutory required minimums  the insurer could be subject to regulatory actions ranging from increased scrutiny to conservatorship 
in addition  various non us jurisdictions prescribe minimum surplus requirements that are based upon solvency  liquidity and reserve coverage measures 
during  the company s hmos and life and health insurance subsidiaries  as well as non us insurance subsidiaries  were compliant with applicable rbc and non us surplus rules 
unfunded pension plan liability as of december   the unfunded pension liability was billion  an increase from december   reflecting a decline in discount rates of basis points  and lower than expected asset returns  partially offset by pension contributions of million in pension contributions in under the pension protection act of are not expected to significantly change from the company s planned funding targets  since discount rates used for funding purposes are based on a month moving average that is less susceptible to volatility than the rate required to be used to compute the liability for the financial statements

this directive will impose economic risk based solvency requirements and supervisory rules and is expected to become effective in january  although certain regulators are requiring companies to demonstrate technical capability and comply with increased capital levels in advance of the effective date 
cigna s european insurance companies are capitalized at levels consistent with projected solvency ii requirements and in compliance with anticipated technical capability requirements 
guarantees and contractual obligations the company is contingently liable for various contractual obligations entered into in the ordinary course of business 
the maturities of the company s primary contractual cash obligations  as of december   are estimated to be as follows in millions  on an undiscounted basis total less than year years years after years on balance sheet insurance liabilities contractholder deposit funds future policy benefits health care medical claims payable unpaid claims and claims expenses short term debt long term debt other long term liabilities off balance sheet purchase obligations operating leases total on balance sheet insurance liabilities 
contractual cash obligations for insurance liabilities  excluding unearned premiums and fees  represent estimated net benefit payments for health  life and disability insurance policies and annuity contracts 
recorded contractholder deposit funds reflect current fund balances primarily from universal life customers 
contractual cash obligations for these universal life contracts are estimated by projecting future payments using assumptions for lapse  withdrawal and mortality 
these projected future payments include estimated future interest crediting on current fund balances based on current investment yields less the estimated cost of insurance charges and mortality and administrative fees 
actual obligations in any single year will vary based on actual morbidity  mortality  lapse  withdrawal  investment and premium experience 
the sum of the obligations presented above exceeds the corresponding insurance and contractholder liabilities of billion recorded on the balance sheet because the recorded insurance liabilities reflect discounting for interest and the recorded contractholder liabilities exclude future interest crediting  charges and fees 
the company manages its investment portfolios to generate cash flows needed to satisfy contractual obligations 
any shortfall from expected investment yields could result in increases to recorded reserves and adversely impact results of operations 
the amounts associated with the sold retirement benefits and individual life insurance and annuity businesses  as well as the reinsured workers compensation and personal accident businesses  are excluded from the table above as net cash flows associated with them are not expected to impact the company

fair values are based on quoted market prices when available 
when market prices are not available  fair value is generally estimated using discounted cash flow analyses  incorporating current market inputs for similar financial instruments with comparable terms and credit quality 
in instances where there is little or no market activity for the same or similar instruments  the company estimates fair value using methods  models and assumptions that the company believes a hypothetical market participant would use to determine a current transaction price 
the prices the company used to value investment assets are representative of prices that would be received to sell the assets at the measurement date exit prices and are classified appropriately in the fair value hierarchy 
the company performs ongoing analyses of prices used to value invested assets to determine that they represent appropriate estimates of fair value 
this process involves quantitative and qualitative analysis that is overseen by the company s investment professionals  including reviews of pricing methodologies  judgments of valuation inputs  and assessments of the significance of any unobservable inputs  pricing statistics and trends 
these reviews are also designed to ensure prices do not become stale  have reasonable explanations as to why they have changed from prior valuations  or require additional review of other anomalies 
the company also performs sample testing of sales values to confirm the accuracy of prior fair value estimates 
exceptions identified during these processes indicate that adjustments to prices are infrequent and result in immaterial adjustments to the valuations

back to contents commercial mortgage loans the company s commercial mortgage loans are fixed rate loans  diversified by property type  location and borrower to reduce exposure to potential losses 
loans are secured by high quality commercial properties and are generally made at less than of the property s value at origination of the loan 
in addition to property value  debt service coverage  building tenancy and stability of cash flows are all important financial underwriting considerations 
property type  location  quality  and borrower are all important underwriting considerations as well 
the company holds no direct residential mortgage loans and does not securitize or service mortgage loans 
the company completed its annual in depth review of its commercial mortgage loan portfolio during the second quarter of this review included an analysis of each property s year end financial statements  rent rolls  operating plans and budgets for  a physical inspection of the property and other pertinent factors 
based on property values and cash flows estimated as part of this review  and considering updates for loans where material changes were subsequently identified  the overall health of the portfolio improved from  consistent with recovery in many of the commercial real estate markets 
based on this review and subsequent portfolio activity  the average loan to value ratio improved to and the debt service coverage ratio was estimated to be at december  the average loan to value ratio decreased from as of december   and the debt service coverage ratio increased from as of december  the decrease in average loan to value ratio generally reflects increased valuations for the majority of the underlying properties 
valuation changes varied by property type as apartments and hotels demonstrated the strongest recovery  retail and office properties showed modest improvement and industrial properties exhibited a slight decline 
the slight increase in debt service coverage ratio reflects greater demand for apartments and hotels  partially offset by slower recovery in leasing rates on industrial properties and ongoing portfolio activity 
commercial real estate capital markets remain most active for well leased  quality commercial real estate located in strong institutional investment markets 
the vast majority of properties securing the mortgages in cigna s mortgage portfolio possess these characteristics 
while commercial real estate fundamentals continued to improve in  the improvement has varied across geographies and property types 
a broad recovery is dependent on continued improvement in the national economy

senior interests in these first mortgage loans were then sold to other institutional investors 
this strategy allowed the company to effectively utilize its origination capabilities to underwrite high quality loans with strong borrower sponsorship  limit individual loan exposures  and achieve attractive risk adjusted yields 
in the event of a default  the company would pursue remedies up to and including foreclosure jointly with the holders of the senior interests  but would receive repayment only after satisfaction of the senior interest 
in the table above  there are four loans in the or above category with an aggregate carrying value of million that exceeds the value of their underlying properties by million 
all of these loans have a current debt service coverage of or greater  along with significant borrower commitment

other long term investments the company s other long term investments include million in security partnership and real estate funds as well as direct investments in real estate joint ventures 
the funds typically invest in mezzanine debt or equity of privately held companies securities partnerships and equity real estate 
given its subordinate position in the capital structure of these underlying entities  the company assumes a higher level of risk for higher expected returns 
to mitigate risk  investments are diversified across approximately separate partnerships  and approximately general partners who manage one or more of these partnerships 
also  the funds underlying investments are diversified by industry sector or property type  and geographic region 
no single partnership investment exceeds of the company s securities and real estate partnership portfolio 
although the total fair values of investments exceeded their carrying values as of december   the fair value of the company s ownership interest in certain funds that are carried at cost was less than carrying value by million 
fund investment values continued to improve  but remained at depressed levels reflecting the impact of declines in value experienced predominantly during and due to economic weakness and disruption in the capital markets  particularly in the commercial real estate market 
the company expects to recover its carrying value over the average remaining life of these investments of approximately years 
given the current economic environment  future impairments are possible  however  management does not expect those losses to have a material effect on the company s results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
problem and potential problem investments problem bonds and commercial mortgage loans are either delinquent by days or more or have been restructured as to terms  which could include concessions by the company for modification of interest rate  principal payment or maturity date 
potential problem bonds and commercial mortgage loans are considered current no payment more than days past due  but management believes they have certain characteristics that increase the likelihood that they may become problems 
the characteristics management considers include  but are not limited to  the following request from the borrower for restructuring  principal or interest payments past due by more than but fewer than days  downgrade in credit rating  collateral losses on asset backed securities  and for commercial mortgages  deterioration of debt service coverage below or value declines resulting in estimated loan to value ratios increasing to or more 
the company recognizes interest income on problem bonds and commercial mortgage loans only when payment is actually received because of the risk profile of the underlying investment

investment outlook the financial markets continue to be impacted by economic uncertainty in the united states and europe  however  asset values increased during  reflecting a decrease in market yields 
future realized and unrealized investment results will be impacted largely by market conditions that exist when a transaction occurs or at the reporting date 
these future conditions are not reasonably predictable 
management believes that the vast majority of the company s fixed maturity investments will continue to perform under their contractual terms  and that declines in their fair values below carrying value are temporary 
based on the strategy to match the duration of invested assets to the duration of insurance and contractholder liabilities  the company expects to hold a significant portion of these assets for the long term 
future credit related losses are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or liquidity 
while management believes the commercial mortgage loan portfolio is positioned to perform well due to its solid aggregate loan to value ratio  strong debt service coverage and minimal underwater positions  broad commercial real estate market fundamentals continue to be under stress reflecting a slow economic recovery 
should these conditions remain for an extended period or worsen substantially  it could result in an increase in problem and potential problem loans 
given the current economic environment  future impairments are possible  however  management does not expect those losses to have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or liquidity

back to contents market risk financial instruments the company s assets and liabilities include financial instruments subject to the risk of potential losses from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
the company s primary market risk exposures are interest rate risk on fixed rate  medium term instruments 
changes in market interest rates affect the value of instruments that promise a fixed return and impact the value of liabilities for reinsured gmdb and gmib contracts 
foreign currency exchange rate risk of the us dollar primarily to the south korean won  euro  taiwan dollar  and british pound 
an unfavorable change in exchange rates reduces the carrying value of net assets denominated in foreign currencies 
equity price risk for domestic equity securities and for the value of reinsured gmdb and gmib contracts resulting from unfavorable changes in variable annuity account values based on underlying mutual fund investments 
for further discussion of reinsured contracts  see note for gmdb contracts and note for gmib contracts in the consolidated financial statements 
the company s management of market risks the company predominantly relies on three techniques to manage its exposure to market risk investment liability matching 
the company generally selects investment assets with characteristics such as duration  yield  currency and liquidity that correspond to the underlying characteristics of its related insurance and contractholder liabilities so that the company can match the investments to its obligations 
shorter term investments support generally shorter term life and health liabilities 
medium term  fixed rate investments support interest sensitive and health liabilities 
longer term investments generally support products with longer pay out periods such as annuities and long term disability liabilities 
use of local currencies for foreign operations 
the company generally conducts its international business through foreign operating entities that maintain assets and liabilities in local currencies 
while this technique does not reduce the company s foreign currency exposure of its net assets  it substantially limits exchange rate risk to those net assets 
use of derivatives 
the company generally uses derivative financial instruments to minimize certain market risks 
see notes c and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about financial instruments  including derivative financial instruments 
effect of market fluctuations on the company the examples that follow illustrate the adverse effect of hypothetical changes in market rates or prices on the fair value of certain financial instruments including a hypothetical increase in market interest rates  primarily for fixed maturities and commercial mortgage loans  partially offset by liabilities for long term debt and gmib contracts  a hypothetical strengthening of the us dollar to foreign currencies  primarily for the net assets of foreign subsidiaries denominated in a foreign currency  and a hypothetical decrease in market prices for equity exposures  primarily for equity securities and gmib contracts

back to contents management believes that actual results could differ materially from these examples because these examples were developed using estimates and assumptions  changes in the fair values of all insurance related assets and liabilities have been excluded because their primary risks are insurance rather than market risk  changes in the fair values of investments recorded using the equity method of accounting and liabilities for pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit plans and related assets have been excluded  consistent with the disclosure guidance  and changes in the fair values of other significant assets and liabilities such as goodwill  deferred policy acquisition costs  taxes  and various accrued liabilities have been excluded  because they are not financial instruments  their primary risks are other than market risk 
the effects of hypothetical changes in market rates or prices on the fair values of certain of the company s financial instruments  subject to the exclusions noted above particularly insurance liabilities  would have been as follows as of december market scenario for certain non insurance financial instruments in millions loss in fair value basis point increase in interest rates strengthening in us dollar to foreign currencies decrease in market prices for equity exposures the effect of a hypothetical increase in interest rates was determined by estimating the present value of future cash flows using various models  primarily duration modeling and  for gmib contracts  stochastic modeling 
the impact of a hypothetical increase to interest rates at december  was less than that at december  reflecting an increase in the fair value of long term debt  primarily due to billion of new borrowings in november  partially offset by an increase to the fair value of the company s fixed income investments 
the effect of a hypothetical strengthening of the us dollar relative to the foreign currencies held by the company was estimated to be of the us dollar equivalent fair value 
the company s foreign operations hold investment assets  such as fixed maturities  that are generally invested in the currency of the related liabilities 
due to the increase in the fair value of these investments in  which are primarily denominated in the south korean won  the effect of a hypothetical strengthening in us dollar to foreign currencies at december  was greater than that effect at december  the effect of a hypothetical decrease in the market prices of equity exposures was estimated based on a decrease in the equity mutual fund values underlying gmib reinsured by the company  in the equity futures contracts used to partially hedge the gmib equity exposures  and in the value of equity securities held by the company 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the company uses futures contracts as part of a gmdb equity hedge program to substantially reduce the effect of equity market changes on certain reinsurance contracts that guarantee minimum death benefits based on unfavorable changes in underlying variable annuity account values 
the hypothetical effect of a increase in the s p  s p  russell  nasdaq  topix japanese  eurostoxx and ftse british equity indices and a weakening in the us dollar to the japanese yen  british pound and euro would have been a decrease of approximately million in the fair value of the futures contracts outstanding under this program as of december  a corresponding decrease in liabilities for gmdb contracts would result from the hypothetical increase in these equity indices and weakening in the us dollar 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this program and related gmdb contracts 
as noted above  the company manages its exposures to market risk by matching investment characteristics to its obligations
