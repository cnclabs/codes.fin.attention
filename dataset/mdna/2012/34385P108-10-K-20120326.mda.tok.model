item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements based on our current expectations  assumptions  estimates and projections about fluidigm and our industry 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those indicated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  as more fully described in risk factors in item a of this form k  in this item  and elsewhere in this form k 
we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason  even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future 
overview we develop  manufacture and market microfluidic systems for growth markets in the life science and agricultural biotechnology  or ag bio  industries 
our proprietary microfluidic systems consist of instruments and consumables  including chips  assays and other reagents 
our systems are designed to significantly simplify experimental workflow  increase throughput and reduce costs  while providing the excellent data quality demanded by our customers 
in addition  our proprietary technology enables genetic analysis that in many instances was previously impractical 
we actively market three microfluidic systems  including eight different commercial chips for nucleic acid research and three families of assays  to leading academic institutions  diagnostic laboratories  and pharmaceutical  biotechnology and ag bio companies 
we have sold over systems to customers in over countries worldwide 
we have launched several product lines  including our biomark system for gene expression analysis  genotyping and digital pcr in  our ep system for snp genotyping and digital pcr in  our access array system for target enrichment in  and our biomark hd real time pcr system for high throughput gene expression analysis  single cell analysis  snp genotyping and digital pcr in in  we also launched our assay and reagent products  including our deltagene assays for gene expression  including single cell analysis  our snptype assays for snp genotyping  and our access array target specific primers for next generation dna sequencing 
our systems utilize one or more chips designed for particular applications and include specialized instrumentation and software  as well as assays and other reagents for certain applications 
we distribute our microfluidic systems through our direct sales force and support organizations located in north america  europe and asia pacific  and through distributors or sales agents in several european  latin american  middle eastern and asia pacific countries 
our manufacturing operations are primarily located in singapore 
our facility in singapore manufactures our instruments and fabricates all of our chips for commercial sale and for our research and development purposes 
our south san francisco facility fabricates chips for our own research and development purposes and manufactures our assays and produces other reagents for commercial sale 
since  we have received revenue from government grants 
our most significant grant relationship has been with the singapore economic development board  or edb 
the edb  an agency of the government of singapore  promotes research  development and manufacturing activities in singapore and associated employment of singapore nationals by providing incentive grants to companies conducting operations in singapore that satisfy the requirements of edb s government programs 
under our agreements with edb  we were eligible to receive incentive grant payments from edb  provided we satisfied certain agreed upon targets 
our agreements with edb provided for incentive funding eligibility through may from january  through december   we recognized million of grant revenue from edb 
our total revenue grew from million in to million in we have incurred significant net losses since our inception in and  as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 

table of contents critical accounting policies  significant judgments and estimates our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this form k are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
changes in accounting estimates may occur from period to period 
accordingly  actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our future financial statement presentation  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows will be affected 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity than our other accounting policies 
accordingly  these are the policies we believe are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we generate revenue from sales of our products  license and collaboration arrangements  research and development contracts and government grants 
our products consist of instruments and consumables  including chips  assays and other reagents related to our microfluidic systems 
product revenue includes services for instrument installation  training and customer support 
we do not sell software separately  however  we offer post contract software support services for certain of our instruments that contain software that is essential to their functionality 
we have entered into collaboration  license  and research and development contracts  and have received government grants to conduct research and development activities 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue from the sales of our products that are not part of multiple element arrangements are recognized when no significant obligation remains undelivered and collection is reasonably assured  which is generally when delivery has occurred 
delivery occurs when there is a transfer of title and risk of loss passes to the buyer 
payments received in advance of revenue recognition are classified as deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets 
the evaluation of these revenue recognition criteria requires significant management judgment 
for instance  we use judgment to assess collectibility based on factors such as the customer s creditworthiness and past collection history  if applicable 
if we determine that collection is not reasonably assured  revenue recognition is deferred until receipt of payment 
we also use judgment to assess whether a price is fixed or determinable  including  but not limited to  reviewing contractual terms and conditions related to payment 
certain of our sales contracts involve the delivery or performance of multiple products or services 
significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting for revenue from multiple element arrangements  including whether the deliverables should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes  how the related sales price should be allocated among the elements  when to recognize revenue for each element and the period over which revenue should be recognized 
revenue recognition for contracts with multiple deliverables is based on the individual units of accounting determined to exist in the contract 
on january   new accounting guidance regarding revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverables became effective 
as a result  for sales of products and services after  we allocate the contract consideration at the inception of the contract to the deliverables based upon their relative selling prices 
a 
table of contents delivered item is considered to be a separate unit of accounting when it has value to the customer on a stand alone basis 
we use our best estimate of selling price for individual deliverables when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence is unavailable 
when the contractual price of each deliverable in an arrangement falls within the range established for estimated selling prices  we recognize revenue for the deliverable based on the contractual price 
in other cases  we allocate revenue to each deliverable based on its selling price 
revenue is only recognized for each deliverable when the revenue recognition criteria have been met 
for sales of products and services prior to  we allocated revenue for transactions that included multiple elements to each unit of accounting based on its relative fair value  and recognized revenue for each unit of accounting when the applicable revenue recognition criteria were met 
when objective and reliable evidence of fair value existed for the undelivered items but not for the delivered items  the residual method was used to allocate arrangement consideration 
under the residual method  the amount of arrangement consideration allocated to the delivered items equaled the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of the undelivered items 
when we were unable to establish stand alone value for delivered items or when fair value of undelivered items had not been established  revenue was deferred until all elements were delivered and services had been performed  or until fair value could objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements 
if the only undelivered element was post contract software support services for which objective and reliable evidence of fair value had not been established  the entire arrangement consideration was recognized ratably over the service period 
until the third quarter of  product installation was considered essential to the functionality of our biomark systems 
accordingly  revenue recognition for all sales of our biomark systems began upon installation 
during the third quarter of  we began shipping our biomark systems fully assembled and calibrated 
we concluded that installation was no longer essential to the functionality of these instruments since the installation could be performed by the customer or an independent third party 
as a result  beginning in the fourth quarter of  we have treated our biomark systems and their related installation as separate units of accounting and instrument revenue is recognized upon delivery  provided that other applicable revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied 
installation revenue is recognized when the installation service is complete 
our products are sold with no right of return 
accruals for estimated warranty expenses are provided for at the time the associated revenue is recognized 
we use judgment to estimate these accruals and  if we were to experience an increase in warranty claims or if costs of servicing our products under warranty were greater than our estimates  our cost of product revenue could be adversely affected in future periods 
we have entered into license  collaboration and research and development arrangements that generally provide us with up front and periodic milestone payments 
revenue from license agreements is recognized when payment is received  up front fees are generally recognized over the term of the agreement  milestone payments are generally recognized when the milestones are achieved  and fees based upon agreed rates for time incurred by our research team are recognized as time is incurred on the project 
revenue from government grants relates to the achievement of agreed upon milestones and expenditures and is recognized in the period in which the related costs are incurred  provided that the conditions under which the government grants are awarded have been substantially met and only perfunctory obligations remain outstanding 
with respect to the edb grants  upon satisfaction of grant conditions  we received incentive grant payments equal to a portion of qualifying expenses we incurred in singapore 
qualifying expenses include salaries  overhead  outsourcing and subcontracting expenses  operating expenses and raw material purchases 
royalties paid are not qualifying expenses under the incentive grant program 
we submitted requests to the edb for incentive grant payments on a quarterly basis  which were subject to the edb s review and our satisfaction of the grant conditions 
our first grant agreement with the edb was completed in july  at which time we submitted our final progress report and evidence of achievement of our development targets under the letter agreement 
in october  we received confirmation from edb that all of our obligations under the first grant 
table of contents had been met and  in october  we received our final grant payment relating thereto 
our second grant agreement with the edb was completed in may based on correspondence with edb  we believe we have satisfied our obligations applicable to our edb grant revenue through december  changes in judgments and estimates regarding application of these revenue recognition guidelines as well as changes in facts and circumstances could result in a change in the timing or amount of revenue recognized in future periods 
stock based compensation we measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments  including stock options and restricted stock units  based on the grant date fair value of the award 
the fair value of options on the grant date is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires the use of certain subjective assumptions  including expected term  volatility  risk free interest rate and the fair value of our common stock 
these assumptions generally require significant judgment 
our board of directors sets the terms  conditions and restrictions related to the grant of stock options and restricted stock units  including the number of shares underlying the grants and the vesting criteria 
with respect to performance based stock options  depending on the extent to which the vesting criteria are met  our board of directors determines the number of shares that vest under the grants 
the resulting costs of our equity awards  net of estimated forfeitures  are recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award  usually a time based vesting period 
we amortize the fair value of stock based compensation on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods 
for performance based stock options  we recognize stock based compensation over the requisite service periods using the accelerated attribution method 
we account for stock options issued to nonemployees at their estimated fair value determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
the fair value of the options granted to nonemployees is remeasured as they vest and the resulting change in value  if any  is recognized as expense during the period in which the related services are rendered 
our common stock has a limited trading history because our common stock was not publicly traded until our initial public offering  or ipo  in february accordingly  the expected volatility of our common stock was derived from the historical volatilities of several unrelated public companies within the life science industry 
when selecting our industry peer companies  we considered the company s stage of development  size and financial leverage 
these historical volatilities are weighted based on certain qualitative factors and combined to produce a single volatility factor 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield in effect at the time of grant for zero coupon us treasury notes with maturities approximately equal to each grant s expected life 
we estimate the expected lives of employee options using the simplified method as the midpoint of the expected time to vest and the contractual term 
for out of the money option grants  we estimate the expected lives based on the midpoint of the expected time to a liquidity event and the contractual term 
the calculated fair value of our stock options could change significantly if we determine that another method is more reasonable  or if another method for calculating these input assumptions is prescribed by authoritative guidance 
higher volatility and longer expected lives result in an increase in stock based compensation expense determined at the date of grant 
stock based compensation expense affects our cost of product revenue  research and development expense  and selling  general and administrative expense 
we estimate our forfeiture rate based on an analysis of our actual forfeitures and we will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience  analysis of employee turnover behavior and other factors 
quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant 
table of contents effect on reported stock based compensation expense  as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed 
if a revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate  an adjustment is made that will result in a decrease to the stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
if a revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate  an adjustment is made that will result in an increase to the stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
the effect of forfeiture adjustments was insignificant during  and we will continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected term  volatility and forfeiture rate related to our stock based compensation 
also required to compute the fair value calculation of options is the fair value of the underlying common stock 
we have historically granted stock options with exercise prices no less than the fair value of our common stock as determined at the date of grant by our board of directors with input from management 
prior to our ipo  our board of directors determined the estimated fair value of our common stock based on an analysis of relevant metrics  including contemporaneous valuations of our common stock by an unrelated third party 
the unrelated third party valuations were prepared using the income or discounted cash flow approach to estimate our aggregate enterprise value at each valuation date 
there is inherent uncertainty in these estimates and if we or the valuation firm had made different assumptions  the amount of our stock based compensation expense  net loss and net loss per share amounts could have been significantly different 
following the completion of our ipo in february  the fair value of options granted is based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant as quoted on the nasdaq global market 
historically  certain of our stock options were granted to officers  with vesting acceleration features based upon the achievement of certain performance milestones 
the timing of the attainment of these milestones affected the timing of expense recognition since we recognize compensation expense only for the portion of stock options that are expected to vest 
we recorded stock based compensation of million  million and million during  and  respectively 
as of december   we had million of unrecognized stock based compensation costs  which are expected to be recognized over an average period of three years 
accounting for income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision benefit for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
our provision for income taxes generally consists of tax expense benefit related to current period earnings 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we continuously monitor the circumstances impacting the expected realization of our deferred tax assets for each jurisdiction 
we consider all available evidence  including historical operating results in each jurisdiction  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
to the extent a deferred tax asset cannot be recognized  a valuation allowance is established to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets in the foreseeable future 
these deferred tax assets primarily consist of net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credits 
we intend to maintain this valuation allowance until sufficient evidence exists to support its reduction 
we make estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans and estimates 
should the actual amounts differ from our estimates  the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted 
changes in these estimates may result in significant increases or decreases to our tax provision in a period in which such estimates are changed  which in turn would affect net income or loss 

table of contents we recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not  based on the technical merits  that the position will be sustained upon examination 
any interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions will be reflected in income tax provision benefit 
inventory valuation we record adjustments to inventory for potentially excess  obsolete  slow moving or impaired goods in order to state inventory at its net realizable value 
the business environment in which we operate is subject to rapid changes in technology and customer demand 
we regularly review inventory for excess and obsolete products and components  taking into account product life cycle and development plans  product expiration and quality issues  historical experience and our current inventory levels 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than anticipated  additional inventory adjustments could be required 
warrants to purchase convertible preferred stock we accounted for freestanding warrants to purchase shares of our convertible preferred stock as liabilities because the warrants may have conditionally obligated us to transfer assets at some point in the future 
the warrants were subject to remeasurement at each balance sheet date  and any change in fair value was recognized as a component of other income expense  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
we estimated the fair value of these warrants at the respective balance sheet dates using the black scholes option pricing model 
upon the completion of our ipo in february  a portion of these outstanding warrants converted into warrants to purchase common stock 
the remainder of the warrants either expired or were net exercised for shares of our common stock and the related liability was reclassified to additional paid in capital 
results of operations revenue we generate revenue from sales of our products  license and collaboration agreements and government grants 
our product revenue consists of sales of instruments and related services  and consumables  including chips  assays and other reagents 
we have entered into license and collaboration agreements and research and development contracts  and have received government grants to conduct research and development activities 
the following table presents our revenue by source for each period presented in thousands 
year ended december  revenue instruments consumables product revenue license and collaboration revenue grant revenue total revenue 
table of contents the following table presents our product revenue by geography and as a percentage of total product revenue by geography based on the billing address of our customers for each period presented in thousands 
year ended december  united states europe japan asia pacific other total grant revenue is received from our incentive grants with the edb and the california institute of regenerative medicine  or cirm 
license and collaboration revenue is primarily generated in the united states 
as we expand our business internationally  we expect our product revenue from outside of the united states to increase as a percentage of our total product revenue 
our customers include academic research institutions  diagnostic laboratories  and pharmaceutical  biotechnology and ag bio companies worldwide 
total revenue from our five largest customers in each of the periods presented comprised  and of revenue in  and  respectively 
comparison of the years ended december  and december  total revenue total revenue increased by million  or  to million for as compared to million for product revenue product revenue increased by million  or  to million for as compared to million for  reflecting increased revenue from sales of instruments and consumables 
consumables revenue increased by million  or  resulting from our higher installed base of instruments and the launch of our assays business in the first half of instrument revenue increased by million  or  resulting from an increase in instrument sales volume of  primarily driven by sales of our access array instrument 
average instrument selling prices were higher for compared to due to the launch of our biomark hd system in the first quarter of  which has a higher average selling price than our other systems  and increased sales in japan and europe  where average selling prices are higher  partially offset by increased sales of our access array systems  which has a lower average selling price compared to our biomark and ep systems 
we expect unit sales of both instruments and consumables to continue to increase in future periods as we continue our efforts to grow our customer base and expand our geographic market coverage 
however  we expect the average selling prices of our instruments to fluctuate over time based on product mix 
license and collaboration revenue license and collaboration revenue was million for compared to million for  primarily related to a fixed fee research and development collaboration agreement the agreement or arrangement that we entered into in may the arrangement provided for an up front fee of million that was recognized on a straight line basis over the estimated period of performance under the agreement 
in march  we amended the agreement and received an additional million payment 
under the amendment  certain milestones and the payment terms associated with satisfaction of the milestones were modified 
the million up front 
table of contents payment and the million payment received in march were being recognized on a straight line basis through september   which was management s best estimate of its period of performance under the amended agreement 
during july  we reassessed the period of performance and extended it through november this change in estimate did not have a material impact on the recognition of the remaining deferred revenue under the agreement 
the arrangement also provided for milestone payments for the design and development of product prototypes  which have been recognized as we achieved each milestone 
during  we achieved three milestones  submitted our final report under the agreement  and recognized million of milestone revenue 
during  we achieved three milestones and recognized million of milestone revenue 
all of our performance obligations under the agreement were completed at december  we may receive additional payments if and when we finalize our on going negotiations with our partner for the next phase of the agreement 
we cannot predict the outcome of these negotiations 
grant revenue grant revenue consists of incentive grants from government entities  including edb and cirm 
grant revenue decreased million to million for compared to million for the decrease relates to a reduction in activity under the edb grant agreements as we achieved certain milestones and reached the end of the grant periods  partially offset by new grant revenue from cirm 
under our incentive grant agreements with edb  we received incentive grant payments equal to a portion of qualifying expenses we incurred in singapore 
qualifying expenses incurred by us in singapore were million in and million in our agreements with edb provided that grants extended to us were subject to certain grant conditions  including increasing our levels of research  development and manufacturing in singapore through the use of local service providers  the hiring and training of personnel in singapore  the incurrence of research and development expenses in singapore  receipt of new investment in our company and the achievement of certain agreed upon milestones relating to the development of our products 
development and manufacturing milestones achieved include completion of feasibility studies and prototype development  establishment of manufacturing lines  process automation and manufacturing yield improvements for our chips and related instruments 
these agreements further provided edb with the right to demand repayment of a portion of past grants in the event that we did not meet our obligations under the applicable agreements 
based on correspondence with edb  we believe we have satisfied our obligations applicable to our edb grant revenue through december  our first grant agreement with the edb was completed in july in october  we received confirmation from edb that all of our obligations under the first grant had been met and  in october  we received our final grant payment relating thereto 
our second grant agreement with the edb was completed in may based on correspondence with edb  we believe we have satisfied our obligations applicable to our edb grant revenue through december  our first cirm grant was awarded in in the amount of million to be earned over a two year period 
our second cirm grant was awarded in in the amount of million to be earned over a three year period 
the cirm grant revenue is recognized as the related research and development services are performed and costs associated with the grants are recognized as research and development expense during the period incurred 
we expect total grant revenue for and future periods to decrease compared to as our edb agreements were completed during and this decrease is partially offset by grant revenue from cirm for us to design and develop prototype microfluidic systems for use in stem cell research 

table of contents cost of product revenue the following table presents our cost of product revenue and product margin for each period presented in thousands

costs related to license  collaboration and grant revenue are included in research and development expense 
cost of product revenue increased million  or  to million for from million for due to increased product sales in cost of product revenue as a percentage of related revenue decreased to for compared to for this decrease was primarily due to lower instrument component costs and higher instrument average selling prices  and  to a lesser extent  lower chip manufacturing costs

we have made substantial investments in research and development since our inception 
our research and development efforts have focused primarily on enhancing our technologies and to support development and commercialization of new and existing products and services 
research and development expense increased million  or  to million for compared to million for the increase relates primarily to increased lab supplies and consumables of million  consulting and professional fees of million to support our new product development  and increased compensation and personnel related costs of million  which include stock based compensation  partially offset by lower equipment and depreciation expense of million 
we believe that our continued investment in research and development is essential to our long term competitive position and these expenses may increase in future periods 

table of contents selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel costs for our sales and marketing  business development  finance  legal  human resources and general management  as well as professional services  such as legal and accounting services 
selling  general and administrative expense increased million  or  to million for  compared to million for the increase was primarily due to increased compensation costs and related expenses  including stock based compensation  of million  resulting from increased headcount to support our business and revenue growth  increased legal and professional fees of million  increased other costs of million to support our public company requirements and increased advertising and promotional costs of million to support our new product introductions and to increase market awareness of our products  partially offset by lower rent expense of million resulting from our lease renewal on more favorable terms for our headquarters facility in south san francisco  california and a decrease in our provision for bad debt expense of million 
we expect selling  general and administrative expense to increase in future periods as we continue to grow our sales  technical support  marketing and administrative headcount  support increased product sales  broaden our customer base and incur additional costs to support our expanded global footprint and the overall growth in our business 
we also expect legal  accounting and compliance costs to increase as a result of being a public company 
litigation settlement on june   we settled certain litigation and entered into a series of patent license agreements resulting in a net million payment by us to life technologies corporation and its applied biosystems  llc subsidiary  referred to as life 
the payment was recognized as litigation settlement expense in our consolidated statement of operations because the amount paid by us was principally attributable to resolving life s litigation claims against us with respect to a specific expiring us patent and its foreign counterparts 
under the terms of the agreements  each party had the option  exercisable for thirty days from the date of the agreements  to limit or preclude certain patent litigation between the parties over a period of two to four years 
these rights were subject to certain exceptions and required an additional payment by the party exercising the option at the time of exercise 
in july  we exercised our option and paid life million 
as a result  subject to certain exceptions  life may not initiate litigation under its patents existing as of june  against our customers for two years and against us  with respect to our current products and equivalent future products  for four years 
the additional payment was recorded in other assets and is being amortized to selling  general and administrative expense over four years on a straight line basis beginning in july the additional payment is being amortized to selling  general and administrative expense because it precludes life from initiating litigation under its relevant patents for any alleged prior and future infringement by us for four years  and because such preclusion relates to our equivalent future products 
life elected not to exercise its option

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
foreign currency exchange risk as we expand internationally our results of operations and cash flows will become increasingly subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
our revenue is generally denominated in the local currency of the contracting party 
historically  the substantial majority of our revenue has been denominated in us dollars 
our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies in which our operations are located  which is primarily in the united states  with a portion of expenses incurred in singapore where our manufacturing facility is located 
our results of operations and cash flows are  therefore  subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates could harm our business in the future 
the effect of a adverse change in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated cash  receivables and payables as of december  and december  would not have been material 
to date  we have not entered into any material foreign currency hedging contracts although we may do so in the future 
interest rate sensitivity we had cash and cash equivalents of million as december  these amounts were held primarily in cash on deposit with banks and money market funds  which are short term 
we had million in investments at december  held primarily in us government agency securities with maturities of less than twelve months 
cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes are held for working capital purposes 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates  however  will reduce future investment income 
if overall interest rates had decreased by during the periods presented  our interest income would not have been materially affected 
as of december   the principal amount of our long term debt outstanding was million and we had no outstanding balance on our bank line of credit 
the interest rates on our long term debt are fixed 
if overall interest rates had increased by during the periods presented  our interest expense would not have been materially affected 
fair value of financial instruments we do not have material exposure to market risk with respect to investments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
we may adopt specific hedging strategies in the future
