fiscal and each contained weeks each  while fiscal contained weeks 
fiscal was a year characterized by significant fluctuations in demand for semiconductor equipment  which is applied s largest business  coupled with an extremely weak market environment for display and solar equipment 
mobility  connectivity and cloud computing trends drove the semiconductor industry spending  with mobility as the biggest influence 
applied also completed its acquisition of varian in the first quarter of fiscal consumer buying patterns for electronic products  combined with growing semiconductor customer concentration  contributed to a seasonality effect  with relatively strong demand for semiconductor equipment led by foundry customers during the first half of fiscal  followed by softening of demand from foundry and logic customers in the third quarter of fiscal and further declines across all categories of wafer fab equipment customers in the fourth quarter of fiscal low investment levels for display equipment continued in fiscal  characterized by decreased capacity requirements for larger flat panel televisions as conditions in this industry remained challenging 
as with the semiconductor industry  demand for mobility products  such as smartphones and tablets  significantly influenced equipment spending in the display industry 
in the solar industry  fiscal was characterized by continued excess manufacturing capacity  which led to significantly reduced demand for c si equipment  as well as weaker operating performance and outlook by the fourth quarter of fiscal the first nine months of fiscal reflected increased demand across all segments except display due to more favorable global economic and industry conditions than in fiscal  although demand softened for semiconductor  lcd and solar equipment in the last quarter of fiscal towards the end of fiscal  the semiconductor  lcd and solar industries were negatively impacted by uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment and the lcd and solar equipment industries were also negatively impacted by overcapacity 
applied s strategic priorities for include expanding market share in wafer fab equipment and growing its technical capabilities  extending its technology leadership in solar and display equipment and enhancing its organization in key product areas 
in semiconductor equipment  applied intends to increase investment in mm and mm research and development and enhance the technical field team

impairment of goodwill applied tested goodwill of the energy and environmental solutions reporting unit for potential impairment during the second quarter of fiscal in light of second quarter developments that included current industry trends  financial performance  weaker short term outlooks  and other adverse operating conditions within the solar industry 
the results of the first step of the impairment test indicated that goodwill of the energy and environmental solutions reporting unit was not impaired at that time 
during the third quarter of fiscal  applied noted no events that would significantly impact the results of the impairment test performed in the second quarter of fiscal however  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the solar industry faced increasing challenges of solar panel manufacturing overcapacity and weaker operating performance and outlook  leading to the deterioration of the solar equipment market and applied s customers financial condition  coupled with lower market valuations 
taking these factors into account  applied reassessed its financial outlook of the energy and environmental solutions reporting unit  and consequently reevaluated the recoverability of energy and environmental solutions goodwill 
accordingly  applied performed the two step impairment test and concluded that the energy and environmental solutions reporting unit s carrying value exceeded its fair value and recorded a million goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  applied also performed a qualitative assessment to test goodwill for the remaining reporting units for impairment and determined that it was more likely than not that each of the silicon systems group  applied global services  and display reporting units fair values exceeded its respective carrying values and that it was not necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test for these reporting units 
the evaluation of goodwill for impairment requires the exercise of significant judgment 
in the event of future changes in business conditions  applied will be required to reassess and update its forecasts and estimates used in future impairment analyses 
if the results of these analyses are lower than current estimates  a material impairment charge may result at that time

recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued authoritative guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income to require an entity to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the authoritative guidance also required presentation of adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income in the statement where the components of net income and the components of other compressive income are presented  which was indefinitely deferred by the fasb in december applied early adopted this authoritative guidance in fiscal the implementation of this authoritative guidance did not have an impact on applied s financial position or results of operations 
in july  the fasb amended its existing guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets 
this authoritative guidance gives companies the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired 
to perform a qualitative assessment  a company must identify and evaluate changes in economic  industry and company specific events and circumstances that could affect the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset 
if a company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of such an asset exceeds its carrying amount  it would not need to calculate the fair value of the asset in that year 
this authoritative guidance becomes effective for applied in the first quarter of fiscal  with early adoption permitted 
the implementation of this authoritative guidance is not expected to have a material impact on applied s financial position or results of operations 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources applied s cash  cash equivalents and investments decreased to billion at october  from billion at october  the decrease in cash was the result of the completion of the acquisition of varian during the first quarter of fiscal  and cash paid for stock repurchases and dividends  which were partially offset by cash generated from operations

for further details regarding applied s operating  investing and financing activities  see the consolidated statements of cash flows in this report 
for details on standby letters of credit and other agreements with banks  see off balance sheet arrangements below 
off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business  applied provides standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third parties as required for certain transactions initiated by either applied or its subsidiaries 
as of october   the maximum potential amount of future payments that applied could be required to make under these guarantee agreements was approximately million 
applied has not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantee agreements beyond that required to appropriately account for the underlying transaction being guaranteed 
applied does not believe  based on historical experience and information currently available  that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under these guarantee agreements 
applied also has agreements with various banks to facilitate subsidiary banking operations worldwide  including overdraft arrangements  issuance of bank guarantees  and letters of credit

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies 
a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of applied s consolidated financial statements and that requires management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on applied s financial condition or results of operations 
specifically  these policies have the following attributes applied is required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate  and different estimates applied could reasonably have used  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur  would have a material effect on applied s financial condition or results of operations 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
applied bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as additional information is obtained and as applied s operating environment changes 
these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known 
in addition  management is periodically faced with uncertainties  the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time 
these uncertainties include those discussed in part i  item a  risk factors 
based on a critical assessment of its accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  management believes that applied s consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  and provide a meaningful presentation of applied s financial condition and results of operations 
management believes that the following are critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition applied recognizes revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is probable 
each sale arrangement may contain commercial terms that differ from other arrangements 
in addition  applied frequently enters into contracts that contain multiple deliverables 
judgment is required to properly identify the accounting units of the multiple deliverable transactions and to determine the manner in which revenue should be allocated among the accounting units 
moreover  judgment is used in interpreting the commercial terms and determining when all criteria of revenue recognition have been met in order for revenue recognition to occur in the appropriate accounting period 
while changes in the allocation of the estimated sales price between the units of accounting will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular sales arrangement  any material changes in these allocations could impact the timing of revenue recognition  which could have a material effect on applied s financial condition and results of operations 
warranty costs applied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is recognized 
estimated warranty costs are determined by analyzing specific product  current and historical configuration statistics and regional warranty support costs 
applied s warranty obligation is affected by product and component failure rates  material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting product failures during the warranty period 
as applied s customer engineers and process support engineers are highly trained and deployed globally  labor availability is a significant factor in determining labor costs 
the quantity and availability of critical replacement parts is another significant factor in estimating warranty costs 
unforeseen component failures or exceptional component performance can also result in changes to warranty costs 
if actual warranty costs differ substantially from applied s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required  which could have a material adverse effect on applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts applied maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
this allowance is based on historical experience  credit evaluations  specific customer collection history and any customer specific issues applied has identified 
changes in circumstances  such as an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligation to applied or its payment trends  may require applied to further adjust its estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to applied  which could have a material adverse effect on applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents inventory valuation inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined on a first in  first out basis 
the carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand 
applied evaluates the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand 
in addition  inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products 
if actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated  additional adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory may be required  which could have a material adverse effect on applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
goodwill and intangible assets applied reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable  and also annually reviews goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives for impairment 
intangible assets  such as purchased technology  are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition 
the value assigned to intangible assets is usually based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired 
if actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates  applied may be required to record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the reporting unit to its realizable value 
the fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using both the income approach and the market approach taking into account such factors as future anticipated operating results and estimated cost of capital 
management uses significant judgment when assessing goodwill for potential impairment  especially in emerging markets 
a severe decline in market value could result in an unexpected impairment charge for impaired goodwill  which could have a material adverse effect on applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
income taxes the effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings  tax regulations governing each region  non tax deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions and availability of tax credits 
management carefully monitors the changes in many factors and adjusts the effective income tax rate as required 
if actual results differ from these estimates  applied could be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust its effective income tax rate  which could have a material adverse effect on applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
applied accounts for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities using statutory tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities  net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets are also reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
management has determined that it is more likely than not that applied s future taxable income will be sufficient to realize its deferred tax assets  net of existing valuation allowance 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with applied s expectations could have a material impact on applied s results of operations and financial condition 
non gaap results management uses non gaap results to evaluate operating and financial performance in light of business objectives and for planning purposes 
applied believes these measures enhance investors ability to review the company s business from the same perspective as management and facilitate comparisons of this period s results with prior periods 
the non gaap results presented below exclude the impact of the following  where applicable certain discrete tax items  restructuring charges and any associated adjustments  certain acquisition related costs  impairments of assets  goodwill  or investments  and or gain or loss on sale of facilities 
these non gaap measures are not in accordance with gaap and may differ from non gaap methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies 
the presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for results prepared in accordance with gaap

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk applied is exposed to interest rate risk related to its investment portfolio and debt issuances 
applied s investment portfolio includes fixed income securities with a fair value of approximately billion at october  these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
based on applied s investment portfolio at october   an immediate basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of the portfolio of approximately million 
while an increase in interest rates reduces the fair value of the investment portfolio  applied will not realize the losses in the consolidated statement of operations unless the individual fixed income securities are sold prior to recovery or the loss is determined to be other than temporary 
at october   the carrying amount of debt issued by applied was billion with an estimated fair value of billion 
a hypothetical decrease in interest rates of basis points would result in an increase in the fair value of applied s debt issuances of approximately million at october  certain operations of applied are conducted in foreign currencies  such as japanese yen  euro  israeli shekel  taiwanese dollar and swiss franc 
applied enters into currency forward exchange and option contracts to hedge a portion of  but not all  existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions expected to occur within months 
gains and losses on these contracts are generally recognized in income at the time that the related transactions being hedged are recognized 
because the effect of movements in currency exchange rates on currency forward exchange and option contracts generally offsets the related effect on the underlying items being hedged  these financial instruments are not expected to subject applied to risks that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates 
applied does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
net foreign currency gains and losses were not material for fiscal
