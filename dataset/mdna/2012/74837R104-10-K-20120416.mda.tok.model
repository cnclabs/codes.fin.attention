md a is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  the other sections of this annual report 
until the sale of all of our interests in kgs  we conducted our operations in two segments our more dominant exploration and production segment  and our significantly smaller midstream segment 
except as otherwise specifically noted  or as the context requires otherwise  and except to the extent that differences between these segments or our geographic segments are material to an understanding of our business taken as a whole  we present this md a on a consolidated basis 
note to the consolidated financial statements in item contains additional information regarding the immaterial restatement to the results of operations primarily for the restated gain on sale of our interests in kgs and to a lesser extent additional depletion expense 
accordingly  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations has been revised for the effects of the immaterial restatement

overview we are an independent oil and gas company engaged primarily in the acquisition  exploration  development  and production of onshore oil and gas based in fort worth  texas 
we focus primarily on unconventional reservoirs where hydrocarbons may be found in challenging geological conditions such as fractured shales  coalbeds and tight sands 
we generate revenue  income and cash flows by producing and selling natural gas  ngls and oil 
we conduct acquisition  exploration  development  and production activities to replace the reserves that we produce 
at december   and of our proved reserves were natural gas and ngls  respectively 
consistent with one of our business strategies  we continue to develop our unconventional resources by applying our expertise to our development projects in our barnett shale asset  horseshoe canyon asset and horn river asset  which had  and  respectively  of our proved reserves at december  during  based on the success of our exploration in our horn river asset  we began to consider this a development area  particularly in the southern portion of our acreage 
our acreage in our horn river asset provides us the most immediate additional opportunity for further application of our unconventional resources expertise 
we focus on three key value drivers reserve growth  production growth  and maximizing our operating margin 
our reserve growth relies on our ability to apply our technical and operational expertise to explore and develop unconventional reservoirs 
we strive to increase reserves and production through aggressive 
table of contents management of our operations and through relatively low risk developmental drilling 
we will also continue to identify high potential exploratory projects with comparatively higher levels of financial risk 
all of our development and exploratory programs are aimed at providing us with opportunities to develop unconventional reservoirs 
we believe the acreage we hold in our core operating areas is well suited for production increases through developmental drilling 
we perform workover and infrastructure projects to reduce ongoing operating costs and enhance current and future production rates 
we regularly review the properties we operate to determine if steps can be taken to efficiently increase reserves and production 
in evaluating the results of our efforts  we consider the capital efficiency of our drilling program and also measure the following key indicators  whose recent results are shown below years ended december  organic reserve growth production volume bcfe cash flow from operating activities in millions diluted earnings loss per share this ratio is calculated by subtracting beginning of the year proved reserves from adjusted end of the year proved reserves and dividing by beginning of the year proved reserves 
adjusted end of the year reserves are calculated by adding back divested reserves and production and deducting acquired reserves from end of the year reserves 
highlights master limited partnership in october  we announced our intention to file a registration statement on form s with the sec in connection with the initial issuance of common units representing limited partner interest in a proposed master limited partnership the mlp 
we expect the mlp will use the proceeds from the sale of common units and borrowings under a planned new bank credit facility as consideration of certain of our barnett shale assets 
we will retain a significant ownership position in the mlp and will own of the general partner 
fortune creek in december  we announced the formation of fortune creek  a midstream partnership with kkr  dedicated to the construction and operation of midstream services to support us and potential producer customers primarily in british columbia  canada 
the highlights of the transaction include our contribution of our existing mile  inch gathering line and compression facilities and year contracts for gas deliveries into those facilities to the partnership  kkr s payment of million to us in exchange for a interest in the partnership  kkr will pay our portion of future development costs for the initial processing facility in exchange for preferential cash flow distributions to kkr  we will be the operator of the partnership  the partnership building and operating natural gas gathering  transportation and processing infrastructure to maximize the value of the production stream from our development in our horn river asset  our dedication of current and future production from our horn river asset to the partnership  our minimum capital commitment of million for drilling and completion activities in our horn river asset for  and  and the formation of an area of mutual interest for the midstream business covering approximately million potential acres in horn river  liard and cordova basins in british columbia and the northwest territories  which is expected to include third party transportation and processing infrastructure and agreements 

table of contents new credit facilities in september  we terminated and replaced our billion global senior secured credit facility with new separate five year syndicated senior secured revolving credit facilities for our us and canadian operations 
the billion initial us credit facility had a borrowing base of million  including a letter of credit capacity of million  as of september  the c million initial canadian credit facility had a borrowing base of c million  including a letter of credit capacity of c million  as of september  during december  the initial us credit facility and the initial canadian credit facility were amended and restated by the combined credit agreements 
the billion combined credit agreements have a global borrowing base of billion  including a global letter of credit capacity of million  as of december  we are currently working with our lending group of banks to establish a revolving credit facility for the mlp 
when it becomes effective  we expect the borrowing base on the combined credit facility to be reduced by million 
we expect the mlp credit facility to have an initial borrowing base of million at the closing of the facility 
convertible debentures on november   we repurchased substantially all of our outstanding convertible debentures for million  after they were presented to us for repurchase by debenture holders 
the repurchase transaction was completed utilizing borrowings from the initial us credit facility 
during the first quarter of  we repurchased the remaining debentures 
emerging basins we have built an acreage position of  acres in the sandwash basin of northwestern colorado in a square mile fairway prospective for the niobara and lower mancos shales 
we drilled and completed seven vertical wells through december  and drilled our first horizontal well in the fourth quarter of with initial production results of bbld and completed approximately  lateral feet  which is half of the length of the lateral we plan to ultimately drill 
we expect to drill and complete four to seven horizontal wells in we have also built a  acre position in the midland and delaware basins of west texas prospective in the bone springs and wolfcamp formations and principally concentrated in four core areas jeff davis and reeves counties  upton and crockett counties  pecos county and presidio county 
in early  we retained an investment bank to help evaluate the opportunities for a joint venture partner to help exploit our west texas acreage 
sale of bbep units during  we sold million bbep units for aggregate proceeds of million  recognizing total gains of million in our income statement as other income 
at december   we no longer owned any bbep units 
capital program we expect our capital program to be spent in the following areas barnett shale sandwash basin west texas total us horn river horseshoe canyon total canada total company in millions drilling and completion midstream leasehold evaluation and acquisition total budgeted capital 
table of contents the chart above does not include approximately million of overhead and interest expense that may be ordinarily capitalized and corporate and administrative capital 
financial risk management we have established internal control policies and procedures for managing risk within our organization 
the possibility of decreasing prices received for our natural gas  ngl and oil production is among the several risks that we face 
we seek to manage this risk by entering into derivative contracts which we strive to account for as hedges 
we have mitigated the downside risk of adverse price movements through the use of these derivatives but  in doing so  have also limited our ability to benefit from favorable price movements 
our commodity price strategy enhances our ability to execute our development and exploration programs  meet debt service requirements and pursue acquisition opportunities even in periods of price volatility or depression 
item a of this annual report contains details of our commodity price and interest rate risk management 
results of operations other us refers to the combined amounts for our operations in our sandwash asset and our bakken asset 
our audited net income is less than that reported in our press release of march  the difference is attributable to the following non cash adjustments recorded after march  million reduction in other revenue and long term derivative assets due to recognition of additional credit risk associated with our counterparties  million additional impairment charge for hcds based on downward revisions to fair value  and the related tax impact for these adjustments

the increase in natural gas volume from our barnett shale asset was primarily the result of additional producing wells in our alliance asset to meet our eni commitment as well as production throughout the basin up lift from well work over activity 
the canadian natural gas production increase was primarily the result of two additional producing wells in our horn river asset that were brought on line in december the decrease in our horseshoe canyon asset production was the result of reduced capital spending and the aging of the field 
the increase in ngl revenue for resulted from an increase in both realized prices and in production primarily from our barnett shale asset compared to the increase in production resulted from additional producing wells and work over activity in the southern portion of the basin 
natural gas revenue for increased from as a result of increases in production in our barnett shale asset  which was primarily the result of wells brought online during higher market prices for natural gas in also caused increased revenue  but were offset by a decrease from hedge contributions 
the small increase in ngl revenue for was due to increased market prices whose effect was reduced by payments made to settle hedges in and a decrease in production from our barnett shale asset compared to

the gas purchase commitment is more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report 
other revenue years ended december  in thousands midstream revenue kgs canada other us total midstream revenue unrealized gains on commodity derivatives gain loss from hedge ineffectiveness other total other revenue increased compared to due to our recognition of million in the period for unrealized gains on commodity derivatives that were not designated as hedges at inception 
these instruments were subsequently designated as hedges in august with unrealized gains and losses from that date forward recognized as a component of aoci 
we do not expect these charges to recur 
these unrealized gains were partially offset by a decrease in fair value of the related hedge assets due to credit risk of our counterparties as of december  us midstream revenue declined in primarily as a result of the sale of our interests in kgs in october and a decrease in volumes gathered in our hcds which contributed to the impairment more fully discussed elsewhere in these results of operations 
the increase in canada is primarily the result of additional customers under contract for the 
table of contents transportation of natural gas 
we had gains attributable to ineffectiveness of our production hedge derivatives for as compared to losses in other revenue for decreased as compared to midstream revenue was lower for primarily as a result of the sale of our interests in kgs in october and lower volume on our hcds

in addition  non variable costs such as compressor 
table of contents overhauls  repairs and replacements  environmental compliance and other costs increased by approximately million 
notably  saltwater disposal costs increased only slightly despite a increase in water volumes due to a higher percentage being piped and disposed of in our own disposal wells at a lower cost 
our horseshoe canyon asset lease operating expense increased primarily due to increases in compression overhauls  utilities and surface costs 
notably  costs per mcfe in our horn river asset decreased as a consequence of increased production levels creating greater coverage of the fixed portion of expense 
we expect the trend of lower unit lease operating expense in our horn river asset will continue in although us lease operating expense for was higher than  lease operating expense per mcfe was unchanged from to increased expense was the result of the increase in production volume in our barnett shale asset for as compared to lease operating expense for in canada was almost unchanged from despite a increase in production compared to lease operating expense for on a canadian dollar basis increased c million  or  from canadian lease operating expense on a canadian dollar basis per mcfe for increased less than from gathering  processing and transportation expense years ended december  in thousands  except per unit amounts per per per mcfe mcfe mcfe barnett shale other us total us horseshoe canyon horn river total canada total gpt increased for compared to primarily due to the loss of fees earned by kgs for gathering and processing production from our barnett shale asset following the closing of the crestwood transaction and the increase in our barnett shale asset production 
kgs revenue  net of associated operating expenses  was million  or per mcfe  for the remainder of the increase is attributable to increases in production although unit costs were lower in excluding kgs effects because more production came from the northern portion of the basin 
canadian gpt increased for as compared to both in total dollars and on a per mcfe basis primarily as a result of higher gathering fees and increased production from our horn river asset for and the recognition of million for unutilized capacity under the company s firm transportation agreements with third parties 
the decrease in our horseshoe canyon asset is primarily due to reduced transportation fees and a decrease in production volumes 
our horseshoe canyon asset gpt also decreased due to reduced operating costs on gathering lines which feature cost sharing arrangements 
gpt for compared to increased primarily due to the loss of fees earned by kgs for gathering and processing production from our barnett shale asset following the closing of the crestwood transaction 
kgs revenue  net of associated operating expense  averaged million per quarter for the first three quarters of fourth quarter gpt consisted primarily of fees charged by kgs 
canadian gpt increased for both in total dollars and on a per mcfe basis primarily as a result of transportation fees associated with higher production from our horn river asset for

the decrease in canadian production taxes is primarily the result of decreased volumes attributable to freehold acreage  which is subject to taxation  and due to decreased pricing upon which tax is levied 
the decrease in us ad valorem taxes as compared to is primarily the result of the sale of kgs  attributing million of the decrease 
the remaining approximate million decrease is attributable to reduced assessed property values as a function of lower prices 
the increase in canadian ad valorem taxes is due to increased rates on freehold lands and an increase in the midstream property base 
production taxes for reflect a increase in realized prices before hedge settlements for production from our barnett shale asset and an increase in production volume from our barnett shale asset when compared to higher us ad valorem taxes for reflect the addition of wells  particularly in areas with higher ad valorem tax rates  and increases to ad valorem tax rates assessed by taxing entities in texas when compared to production taxes for included million of ad valorem taxes attributable to kgs

depletion  depreciation and accretion years ended december  in thousands  except per unit amounts per per per depletion mcfe mcfe mcfe us canada total depletion depreciation of other fixed assets us canada total depreciation accretion total 
table of contents us depletion for reflected an increase in the us depletion rate and an increase in us production when compared to the period 
we expect that our consolidated depletion rate for will be approximately per mcfe 
the increase in the rate was due to a decrease in reserves and an increase in the depletion base associated with our capital program 
price deterioration adversely affected reserves in canadian depletion rate in was impacted by the impairment recognized in as the increase in proved reserves resulted in only a increase in the depletion base 
us depreciation decreased from primarily as the result of including kgs depreciation of million and a million impairment of midstream assets 
canadian depreciation for reflects seven months of depreciation on our horn river asset midstream additions which were contributed in the formation of fortune creek 
us depletion expense for was greater than as an increase in us production was partially offset by a decrease in the us depletion rate 
changes in the us canadian dollar exchange rate accounted for million of the increase in canadian depletion expense 
both our us and canadian depletion rates have been impacted by the impairment charges recognized during the canadian depletion rate has been further impacted by evaluated horn river asset capital costs and future development costs included in proved reserve estimates at december  the decrease in us depreciation expense as compared to is the result of the sale of kgs 
kgs depreciation expense through september was million as compared to million for all of impairment expense as required under gaap  we perform quarterly ceiling tests to assess impairment of our oil and gas properties 
we also assess our fixed assets reported outside the full cost pool when circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
information detailing the calculation of any impairment is more fully described in our critical accounting policies found below and in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report 
in performing our quarterly ceiling tests  we utilize first of month prices for the preceding months 
due to the decrease in natural gas prices in the first quarter compared to the first quarter  there is a significant likelihood of impairment of oil and gas properties 
as of december   our us and canadian ceiling tests included million and million  respectively  in value for our derivatives treated as hedges of production 
absent this recognition  after tax we would have recognized million of additional impairment expense for our us oil and gas properties and million for our canadian oil and gas properties 
we recognized a million non cash charge for impairment of our canadian oil and gas properties in the aeco natural gas price used to prepare the march  estimate of the ceiling limit for our canadian full cost pool decreased approximately from the aeco price used at december  when we also recognized an impairment charge for our canadian oil and gas properties 
our canadian ceiling test prepared at june   september  and december  resulted in no additional impairment of our canadian oil and gas properties 
our us ceiling tests  prepared quarterly  resulted in no impairment of our us oil and gas properties in in  we recognized a million impairment for certain midstream assets in texas that we retained after the sale of kgs 
the primary factors for the impairment were our inability to attract third party customers to utilize the pipe and a decrease in reserves from our assets that utilize the laterals 
during  we discontinued our efforts to actively market the hcds assets and recognized additional impairment of hcds 
we conducted an impairment analysis of the hcds and recorded million during to reduce the carrying value to estimated fair value 
in  we recognized impairment expense of million 
as a result of the decision by our board of directors to approve a plan for disposal of our hcds  we conducted an impairment analysis of the hcds and recognized a million non cash charge for impairment 
we also recognized a non cash million charge for impairment of our canadian oil and gas properties 
our canadian full cost pool has undergone significant change associated with the cost of bringing our initial horn river asset wells online and associated field costs while the proved reserves recognized have been limited due to the lack of any substantial production history for the area 

table of contents we recognized non cash charges totaling million for impairments related to both our us and canadian oil and gas properties in the primary factor that caused the decrease in the future cash flows from our proved oil and gas reserves was lower benchmark natural gas prices at march  for the us and canada and further canadian price decreases at june  the canadian impairment also resulted from a near term decrease in expected capital spending with a consequent reduction in near term production and revenue 
at september   the unamortized cost of our canadian oil and gas properties exceeded the full cost ceiling limitation by million 
as permitted by full cost accounting rules in effect at that date  improvements in aeco spot natural gas prices subsequent to september  eliminated the necessity to record a charge for impairment 
general and administrative expense years ended december  in thousands  except per unit amounts per per per mcfe mcfe mcfe equity compensation litigation settlement strategic transactions other total general and administrative costs for the period included million for litigation settlement and million for legal  accounting and professional fees incurred in connection with the evaluation of possible strategic transactions 
general and administrative expense for the period included costs for the settlement of a separate legal matter for million  professional and legal fees incurred in connection with the crestwood transaction of million plus million of kgs general and administrative expense arising prior to the crestwood transaction 
general and administrative expense for was million greater than due to an increase in stock based compensation expense  which included million for the vesting of all of kgs unvested stock based compensation at the time of its sale 
legal and professional fees for  however  were million lower than in primarily due to settlement of our litigation with bbep in april and a decrease in litigation settlement costs 
these decreases were partially offset by million incurred in for transaction costs  principally investment banking and legal fees  related to the crestwood transaction 
we expect elevated levels of general and administrative expense in as there will be additional costs after the mlp becomes publicly traded  such as costs for director fees  listing fees and investor relations 
gain on sale of kgs in october  we recognized a million gain upon closing of the crestwood transaction 
further information regarding the transaction can be found in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
income from earnings of bbep we record our portion of bbep s earnings during the quarter in which its financial statements become publicly available 
as a result  our  and annual results of operations include bbep s earnings for the months ended september   and  respectively 
additionally  we reduced our ownership of bbep units in and eliminated our remaining ownership position in as of december   we no longer owned any bbep units 

table of contents we recognized an million loss and income of million for equity earnings from our investment in bbep based upon its reported earnings for the month period ended september  and  respectively 
during the time we owned bbep units  bbep experienced significant volatility in its net earnings primarily due to changes in the value of its derivative instruments for which it did not employ hedge accounting 
impairment of investment in bbep during the first quarter of  we evaluated our investment in bbep for impairment in response to further decreases in prevailing commodity prices and the bbep unit price after december  as a result of these decreases  we made the determination that the decline in value was other than temporary 
accordingly  our impairment analysis  which utilized the march  closing price of per bbep unit  resulted in aggregate fair value of million for the portion of bbep units that we owned 
the million aggregate fair value was compared to the million carrying value of our investment in bbep 
we recorded the difference of million as an impairment charge during the first quarter of a similar analysis was performed at each subsequent quarter end of  and  which resulted in no further impairment

project and expenditure authorization in april  we entered into a project and expenditure authorization pea with ngtl  which supports the ngtl project through our commitment for future delivery of gas from our horn river asset 
in order to deliver gas that meets ngtl s specifications  we  through fortune creek  will construct a treatment facility for our gas 
under the pea  we agreed to provide financial assurances to cover ngtl s costs for the ngtl project  estimated to be c million including taxes of approximately c million  which is estimated to occur in stages based on ngtl s forecast of the ngtl project costs  in the following cumulative amounts ngtl cumulative financial assurances c in thousands us in thousands july  october  july  october  a letter of credit for c million is outstanding for the ngtl project as of december  the pea also requires that we execute firm transportation agreements for delivery of a minimum volume of gas of approximately mmcfd  increasing to mmcfd  over a ten year term commencing with the in service date of the ngtl project 
the pea may be terminated prior to completion of the ngtl project for various reasons  including the failure to obtain neb approval upon terms and conditions satisfactory to ngtl 
upon early termination  we must pay actual costs incurred or paid by ngtl  or for which ngtl is liable  as of the termination date except in certain limited situations 
in the event that the termination occurs  we would pay those costs plus approximately c million with the option to purchase for an additional commitment letter agreement in april  we entered into a commitment letter agreement the commitment letter with ngtl

if neither has occurred by the end of the term of the transportation agreements  we will be required to renew the contract on an annual basis for a minimum volume of mmcfd until either the cost recovery or volume delivery requirements have been met 
the commitment letter terminates if the pea terminates for any reason other than the completion of the ngtl project 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
in connection with the preparation of our financial statements  we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events  and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expense and the related disclosures 
we base our assumptions  estimates and judgments on historical experience  current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time we prepare our consolidated financial statements 
on a regular basis  management reviews the accounting policies  assumptions  estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with gaap 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ materially from our assumptions and estimates 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  and they require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with our audit committee 
oil and gas reserves policy description proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of oil  natural gas  and ngls that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
under the current rule adopted by the sec in december  we incorporated the following changes into our proved reserve process and related disclosures for  and the use of an unweighted average of the preceding month first day of the month prices for determination of proved reserve values included in calculating full cost ceiling limitations and for annual proved reserve disclosures  consideration of and limitations on the types of technologies that may be used to reliably establish and estimate proved reserves  reporting of investments and progress made during the year to convert proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves  and  reporting on the independence and qualifications of our personnel and independent petroleum engineers who are responsible for the preparation of our reserve estimates 
operating costs are the period end operating costs at the time of the reserve estimate and are held constant into future periods 
our estimates of proved reserves are determined and reassessed at least annually using available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data 
revisions may result from changes in  among other things  reservoir performance  prices  economic conditions and governmental restrictions 
our proved reserve estimates and related disclosures for  and are presented in compliance with this new rule 
the current sec rule allows the recognition of pud reserves to be booked beyond one offset location where reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances  whereas the prior rule allowed recognizing only one offset 
in accordance with the current rule  we recognized incremental pud locations in our barnett shale asset 
in our barnett shale asset  we had proved 
table of contents undeveloped gas well locations at december   including locations that are more than one offset 
additional information regarding our proved oil and gas reserves may be found under oil and natural gas reserves found in item of this annual report 
judgments and assumptions all of the reserve data in this annual report are based on estimates 
estimates of our oil  natural gas and ngl reserves are prepared in accordance with guidelines established by the sec 
reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating recoverable underground accumulations of oil  natural gas and ngls 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating recoverable quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves 
uncertainties include the projection of future production rates and the expected timing of development expenditures 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
as a result  reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of oil  natural gas and ngls that are ultimately recovered 
the passage of time provides more qualitative information regarding estimates of reserves  and revisions are made to prior estimates to reflect updated information 
the weighted average annual revisions to our reserve estimates over the last four years have been less than of the weighted average previous year s estimate excluding revisions due to price changes 
however  there can be no assurance that more significant revisions will not be necessary in the future 
if future significant revisions are necessary that reduce previously estimated reserve quantities  it could result in a ceiling test related impairment 
in addition to the impact of the estimates of proved reserves on the calculation of the ceiling limitation  estimation of proved reserves is also a significant component of the calculation of depletion expense 
for example  if estimates of proved reserves decline  the depletion rate will increase  resulting in a decrease in net income 
full cost ceiling calculations policy description we use the full cost method to account for our oil and gas properties 
under the full cost method  all costs associated with the acquisition  exploration  and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized and accumulated in cost centers on a country by country basis 
this includes any internal costs that are directly related to development and exploration activities  but does not include any costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
proceeds received from disposals are credited against accumulated cost except when the sale represents a significant disposal of reserves  in which case a gain or loss is calculated and recognized 
the application of the full cost method generally results in higher capitalized costs and higher depletion rates compared to its alternative  the successful efforts method 
the sum of net capitalized costs and estimated future development and dismantlement costs for each cost center is depleted on the equivalent unit of production basis using proved oil and gas reserves 
excluded from amounts subject to depletion are costs associated with unevaluated properties 
under the full cost method  net capitalized costs are limited to the lower of unamortized cost reduced by the related net deferred tax liability and asset retirement obligations or the cost center ceiling 
the cost center ceiling is defined as the sum of estimated future net revenue  discounted at per annum  from proved reserves  based on the unweighted average of the preceding month first day of the month prices adjusted to reflect local differentials and contract provisions  unescalated year end costs and financial derivatives that hedge our oil and gas revenue  the cost of properties not being amortized  the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties included in the cost being amortized less income tax effects related to differences between the book and tax bases of the oil and gas properties 
if the net book value reduced by the related net deferred income tax liability and asset retirement obligations exceeds the cost center ceiling limitation  a non cash impairment charge is required 
judgments and assumptions the discounted present value of future net cash flows from our proved oil  natural gas and ngl reserves is the major component of the ceiling calculation  and is determined in connection with the estimation of our proved oil  natural gas and ngl reserves 
estimates of reserves are forecasts based on engineering data  
table of contents projected future rates of production and the timing of future expenditures 
the process of reserve estimation requires substantial judgment  resulting in imprecise determinations  particularly for new discoveries 
different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities based on the same data 
while the quantities of proved reserves require substantial judgment  the associated prices of natural gas  ngl and oil reserves  and the applicable discount rate  that are used to calculate the discounted present value of the reserves do not require judgment 
the current sec rule requires the use of the future net cash flows from proved reserves discounted at 
therefore  the future net cash flows associated with the proved reserves is not based on our assessment of future prices or costs 
in calculating the ceiling  we adjust the future net cash flows by the discounted value of derivative contracts in place that hedge future prices 
this valuation is determined by calculating the difference between reserve pricing and the contract prices for such hedges also discounted at 
because the ceiling calculation dictates that our historical experience be held constant indefinitely and requires a discount factor  the resulting value is not necessarily indicative of the fair value of the reserves or the oil and gas properties 
oil and natural gas prices have historically been volatile 
at any time that we conduct a ceiling test  forecasted prices can be either substantially higher or lower than our historical experience 
also  marginal borrowing rates may be well below the required used in the calculation 
rates below  if they could be utilized  would have the effect of increasing the otherwise calculated ceiling amount 
therefore  oil and gas property ceiling test related impairments that result from applying the full cost ceiling limitation  and that are caused by fluctuations in price as opposed to reductions to the underlying quantities of reserves  should not be viewed as absolute indicators of a reduction of the ultimate value of the related reserves 
derivative instruments policy description we enter into financial derivative instruments to mitigate risk associated with the prices received from our production 
we may also utilize financial derivative instruments to hedge the risk associated with interest rates on our outstanding debt 
we account for our derivative instruments by recognizing qualifying derivative instruments on our balance sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at their fair value determined by reference to published future market prices and interest rates 
to designate a derivative as a cash flow hedge  we document at the hedge s inception our assessment that the derivative will be highly effective in offsetting expected changes in cash flows from the item hedged 
this assessment  which is updated at least quarterly  includes performing regression analysis and is generally based on the most recent relevant historical correlation between the derivative and the item hedged 
if  during the derivative s term  we determine the hedge is no longer highly effective  hedge accounting is prospectively discontinued and any remaining unrealized gains or losses  based on the effective portion of the derivative at that date  are reclassified to earnings as revenue or interest expense when the underlying transaction occurs 
for derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges  the effective portions of gains or losses are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income and recognized in earnings during the period in which the hedged transactions are realized 
gains or losses on qualified derivative instruments terminated prior to their original expiration date are deferred and recognized as income or expense in the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized 
if the hedged transaction becomes probable of not occurring  the deferred gain or loss is immediately recorded to earnings 
the ineffective portion of the hedge relationship is recognized currently as a component of other revenue 
the fair values of natural gas and ngl derivatives are estimated using published market prices of natural gas and ngls for the periods covered by the contracts 
estimates are determined by applying the net differential between the prices in each derivative and market prices for future periods  to the volume stipulated in each contract to arrive at an estimated value of future cash flow streams 
these estimated future cash flow values are then discounted for each contract at rates commensurate with federal treasury instruments with similar contractual lives to arrive at estimated fair value 
for derivative instruments that qualify as fair value hedges the gains or losses on the derivative instruments are recognized currently in earnings and the changes in value of the hedged items are also recognized currently in 
table of contents earnings 
any gains or losses on the derivative instruments not offset by the gains or losses on the hedged items are recognized as the value of ineffectiveness in the hedge relationships 
for interest rate swaps that qualify as fair value hedges of our fixed rate debt outstanding  ineffectiveness is recognized currently as a component of interest expense 
the fair value of all interest rate derivatives is estimated using published libor interest rates for the periods covered by the contracts 
the estimates are determined by applying the net differential between the interest rate in each derivative and interest rates for future periods  to the notional amount stipulated in each contract to arrive at estimated future cash flow streams 
we enter into derivatives with counterparties who are our lenders 
all versions of our credit facility provide for collateralization of amounts outstanding from our derivatives in addition to amounts outstanding under the facility 
additionally  default on any of our obligations under derivatives with counterparty lenders could result in acceleration of the amounts outstanding under the credit facility 
our credit facility and our internal credit policies require that any counterparties  including facility lenders  with whom we enter into commodity derivatives have credit ratings that meet or exceed bbb or baa from standard and poor s or moody s  respectively 
the fair value for each derivative takes credit risk into consideration  whether it be our counterparties or our own 
derivatives are classified as current or non current derivative assets and liabilities  based on the expected timing of settlements 
judgments and assumptions the estimates of the fair values of our commodity and interest rate derivative instruments require substantial judgment 
valuations are based upon multiple factors such as futures prices  volatility data from major oil and gas trading points  length of time to maturity and interest rates 
we compare our estimates of fair value for these instruments with valuations obtained from independent third parties and counterparty valuation confirmations 
the values we report in our financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results 
future changes to forecasted or realized commodity prices could result in significantly different values and realized cash flows for such instruments 
stock based compensation policy description an estimate of fair value is determined for all share based payment awards 
recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards is recognized over the vesting period for each award 
judgments and assumptions estimating the grant date fair value of our stock based compensation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the grant date fair value of our awards 
these assumptions and judgments include estimating the future volatility of our stock price  expected dividend yield  future employee turnover rates and future employee stock option exercise behaviors 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions that we use to determine stock based compensation expense 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to changes in stock based compensation expense that could be material 
if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions used  the stock based compensation expense reported in our financial statements may not be representative of the actual economic cost of the stock based compensation 
income taxes policy description deferred income taxes are established for all temporary differences between the book and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
in addition  deferred tax balances must be adjusted to reflect tax rates that we expect will be 
table of contents in effect during years in which we expect the temporary differences will reverse 
canadian taxes are computed at rates in effect or expected to be in effect in canada 
us deferred tax liabilities are not recognized on profits that are expected to be permanently reinvested in canada and thus are not considered available for distribution to us 
net operating loss carry forwards and other deferred tax assets are reviewed annually for recoverability  and if necessary  are recorded net of a valuation allowance 
judgments and assumptions we must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and provide judgment on the amount of financial statement benefit that an uncertain tax position will realize upon ultimate settlement 
to the extent that we believe that a more than probability exists that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  we must establish a valuation allowance 
significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets and in determining the amount of financial statement benefit to record for uncertain tax positions 
we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  to determine whether  based on the weight of the evidence  a valuation allowance is needed and consider the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement of an uncertain tax position using the facts  circumstances and information available at the reporting date to establish the appropriate amount of financial statement benefit 
evidence used for the valuation allowance includes information about our current financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years  as well as all currently available information about future years  including our anticipated future performance  the reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities and tax planning strategies available to us 
to the extent that a valuation allowance or uncertain tax position is established or changed during any period  we would recognize expense or benefit within our consolidated tax expense 
off balance sheet arrangements our contracts with ngtl provide financial assurances to it during the construction phase of the ngtl project  which is expected to continue through assuming the project is fully constructed at estimated costs of c million  we expect to provide letters of credit through note to the consolidated financial statements found in item of this annual report contains additional information about our contracts with ngtl 
recently issued accounting standards the information regarding recent accounting pronouncements materially affecting our consolidated financial statements is included in note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report  which is incorporated herein by reference

through terminations of a portion of our existing natural gas hedge positions  we executed a new series of hedges that accomplish a revised natural gas hedging platform of production year daily production floor cap mmbtud 
table of contents these hedges did not result in the transfer or the receipt of any net cash proceeds 
we expect our entire hedge portfolio to continue to qualify for hedge accounting 
the fair value of all derivative instruments included in these disclosures was estimated using prices quoted in markets for the periods covered by the derivatives and the value confirmed by counterparties 
estimates were determined by applying the net differential between the prices in each derivative and market prices for future periods to the amounts stipulated in each contract to arrive at an estimated future value 
this estimated future value was discounted on each contract at rates commensurate with federal treasury instruments with similar contractual lives 
interest rate risk in  we executed early settlements of our interest rate swaps that were designated as fair value hedges of our senior notes due and our senior subordinated notes 
we deferred gains of million as a fair value adjustment to our debt  which we began to recognize over the life of the associated debt instruments 
for  and  interest expense decreased million  million and million  respectively  because of our interest rate swaps 
should we be required to borrow under our combined credit agreements and based on interest rates as of december   each million in borrowings would result in additional annual interest payments of million 
if the current borrowing availability under our combined credit agreements were to be fully utilized by year end at interest rates as of december   we estimate that annual interest payments would increase by million 
if interest rates change by on our december  variable debt balances of million our annual pre tax income would decrease or increase by million 
in the future  we may enter into interest rate derivative contracts on a portion of our outstanding debt to mitigate the risk of fluctuation of rates or manage the floating versus fixed rate risk 
foreign currency risk our canadian subsidiary uses the canadian dollar as its functional currency 
to the extent that business transactions in canada are not denominated in canadian dollars  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
for  and  non functional currency transactions resulted in losses of million  million  and million  respectively  included in net earnings 
furthermore  the amended and restated canadian credit facility permits canadian borrowings to be made in either us or canadian denominated amounts 
however  the aggregate borrowing capacity of the entire facility is calculated using the us dollar equivalent 
accordingly  there is a risk that exchange rate movements could impact our available borrowing capacity
