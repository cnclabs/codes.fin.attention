table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our historical financial statements and notes included in part iv of this annual report 
overview targa resources partners lp is a publicly traded delaware limited partnership formed in october by targa resources corp 
targa or parent 
in this annual report  unless the context requires otherwise  references to we  us  our or the partnership are intended to mean the business and operations of targa resources partners lp and its consolidated subsidiaries 
targa resources gp llc the general partner is a delaware limited liability company formed by targa in october to own a general partner interest in us 
its primary business purpose is to manage our affairs and operations 
targa resources gp llc is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of targa 
we acquired targa s ownership interests in the following assets  liabilities and operations on the dates indicated collectively  the dropdown transactions february north texas system  october saou and lou  september downstream business  april permian business and straddle assets  august versado  and september venice operations 
for periods prior to the above acquisition dates  we refer to the operations  assets and liabilities of these acquisitions as our predecessors 
our operations we are engaged in the business of gathering  compressing  treating  processing and selling natural gas  storing  fractionating  treating  transporting and selling ngls and ngl products  and storing and terminaling refined petroleum products and crude oil 
we report our operations in two divisions i natural gas gathering and processing  consisting of two reportable segments a field gathering and processing and b coastal gathering and processing  and ii logistics and marketing consisting of two reportable segments a logistics assets and b marketing and distribution 
the financial results of our hedging activities are reported in other 
our natural gas gathering and processing division includes assets used in the gathering of natural gas produced from oil and gas wells and processing this raw natural gas into merchantable natural gas by extracting ngls and removing impurities 
the field gathering and processing segment s assets are located in north texas and the permian basin of west texas and new mexico 
the coastal gathering and processing segment s assets are located in the onshore and near offshore regions of the louisiana gulf coast and the gulf of mexico 
our logistics and marketing division is also referred to as our downstream business 
our downstream business includes all the activities necessary to convert raw ngls into ngl products and provides certain value added services such as storing  terminaling  transporting  distributing and marketing of ngls  refined petroleum products and crude oil 
it also includes certain natural gas supply and marketing activities in support of our other operations 

table of contents our logistics assets segment is involved in transporting  storing and fractionating mixed ngls  storing  terminaling and transporting finished ngls  and storing and terminaling refined petroleum products and crude oil 
these assets are generally connected to  and supplied in part by  our natural gas gathering and processing segments and are predominantly located in mont belvieu  texas and southwestern louisiana 
this segment includes the activities associated with the acquisitions of refined petroleum products and crude oil storage and terminaling facilities 
see developments 
our marketing and distribution segment covers activities required to distribute and market raw and finished ngls and all natural gas marketing activities 
it includes marketing our own ngl production and purchasing ngl products in selected united states markets  providing liquefied petroleum gas balancing services to refinery customers  transporting  storing and selling propane and providing related propane logistics services to multi state retailers  independent retailers and other end users  and marketing natural gas available to us from our natural gas gathering and processing division and the purchase and resale of natural gas in selected united states markets 
other contains the results of our commodity hedging activities 

table of contents factors that significantly affect our results our results of operations are substantially impacted by the volumes that move through our gathering  processing and logistics assets  changes in commodity prices  our contract terms  the impact of our hedging activities and the cost to operate and support our assets 
volumes 
in our gathering and processing operations  plant inlet volumes and capacity utilization rates generally are driven by wellhead production  our competitive and contractual position on a regional basis and more broadly by the impact of prices for oil  natural gas and ngls on exploration and production activity in the areas of our operations 
the factors that impact the gathering and processing volumes also impact the total volumes that flow to our downstream business 
in addition  fractionation volumes are also affected by the location of the resulting mixed ngls  available pipeline capacity to transport ngls to our fractionators  and our competitive and contractual position relative to other fractionators 
commodity prices 
the following table presents selected annual and quarterly industry index prices for natural gas  selected ngl products and crude oil and for the periods presented average quarterly annual prices natural gas mmbtu illustrative targa ngl gallon crude oil bbl th quarter rd quarter nd quarter st quarter average th quarter rd quarter nd quarter st quarter average th quarter rd quarter nd quarter st quarter average natural gas prices are based on average quarterly and annual prices from henry hub i ferc commercial index prices 
ngl prices are based on quarterly and annual averages of prices from mont belvieu non tet monthly commercial index prices 
illustrative targa ngl contains ethane  propane  natural gasoline  isobutane and normal butane 
crude oil prices are based on quarterly and annual averages of daily prices from west texas intermediate commercial index prices as measured on the nymex 

table of contents contract terms  contract mix and the impact of commodity prices 
because of the significant volatility of natural gas and ngl prices  the contract mix of our natural gas gathering and processing segment can have a significant impact on our profitability  especially those that create exposure to changes in energy prices equity volumes 
set forth below is a table summarizing the mix of our natural gas gathering and processing contracts for and the potential impacts of commodity prices on operating margins percent of throughput contract type impact of commodity prices percent of proceeds percent of liquids decreases in natural gas and or ngl prices generate decreases in operating margins 
fee based no direct impact from commodity price movements 
wellhead purchases keep whole increases in natural gas prices relative to ngl prices generate decreases in operating margin 
hybrid in periods of favorable processing economics  similar to percent of liquids or to wellhead purchases keep whole in some circumstances  if economically advantageous to the processor 
in periods of unfavorable processing economics  similar to fee based 
favorable processing economics typically occur when processed ngls can be sold  after allowing for processing costs  at a higher value than natural gas on a btu equivalent basis 
negotiated contract terms are based upon a variety of factors  including natural gas quality  geographic location  the competitive commodity and pricing environment at the time the contract is executed  and customer requirements 
our gathering and processing contract mix and  accordingly  our exposure to natural gas and ngl prices  may change as a result of producer preferences  competition  and changes in production as wells decline at different rates or are added  our expansion into regions where different types of contracts are more common as well as other market factors 
the contract terms and contract mix of our downstream business can also have a significant impact on our results of operations 
during periods of low relative demand for available fractionation capacity  rates were low and frac or pay contracts were not readily available 
currently  demand for fractionation services is near existing industry capacity  rates have increased  contract lengths have increased and reservation fees are required 
these fractionation contracts in the logistics assets segment are primarily fee based arrangements while the marketing and distribution segment includes both fee based and percent of proceeds contracts 
impact of our commodity price hedging activities 
in an effort to reduce the variability of our cash flows  we have hedged the commodity price associated with a portion of our expected natural gas and ngl equity volumes through and condensate equity volumes through by entering into derivative financial instruments including swaps and purchased puts or floors 
with these arrangements  we have attempted to mitigate our exposure to commodity price movements with respect to our forecasted volumes for these periods 
we actively manage the downstream business product inventory and other working capital levels to reduce exposure to changing ngl prices 
for additional information regarding our hedging activities  see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk 
operating expenses 
variable costs such as fuel  utilities  power  service and repairs can impact our results as volumes fluctuate through our systems 
continued expansion of existing assets will also give rise to additional operating expenses  which will affect our results 
general and administrative expenses 
our omnibus agreement with targa  our general partner and others addresses the reimbursement of costs incurred on our behalf and indemnification matters 
under the omnibus agreement as amended  which runs through april  targa will provide general and administrative and other services to us associated with our existing assets and any future targa conveyances and subject to mutual agreement  our future acquisitions from third parties 
since october   after the final conveyance of assets to us by targa  substantially all of targa s general and administrative costs have been and will continue to be allocated to us  other than targa s direct costs of being a separate public reporting company 
the employees supporting our operations are employees of targa resources llc  a delaware limited liability company and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of targa 
we reimburse targa for the payment of certain operating expenses  including compensation and benefits of operating personnel assigned to our assets  and for the provision of various general and administrative services for our benefit 
targa performs centralized corporate functions for us  such as legal  accounting  treasury  insurance  risk management  health  safety  environmental  information technology  human resources  credit  payroll  internal audit  taxes  engineering and marketing 

table of contents general trends and outlook we expect the midstream energy business environment to continue to be affected by the following key trends demand for our services  commodity prices  volatile capital markets and increased regulation 
these expectations are based on assumptions made by us and information currently available to us 
to the extent our underlying assumptions about or interpretations of available information prove to be incorrect  our actual results may vary materially from our expected results 
demand for our services 
fluctuations in energy prices can affect production rates and investments by third parties in the development of oil and natural gas reserves 
generally  drilling and production activity will increase as energy prices increase 
we believe that the current strength of oil  condensate and ngl prices as compared to natural gas prices has caused producers in and around our natural gas gathering and processing areas of operation to focus their drilling programs on regions rich in liquid forms of hydrocarbons 
this focus is reflected in increased drilling permits and higher rig counts in these areas  and we expect these activities to lead to higher inlet volumes in the field gathering and processing segment over the next several years 
while we expect demand for our ngl products to remain strong  a reduction in demand for ngl products or a significant increase in ngl product supply relative to this demand  could impact our business 
increases in demand for international grade propane  along with expansion in the petrochemical industry  which relies on ethane as a feedstock  point towards sustained demand for our terminaling and storage services in the downstream business 
producer activity in areas rich in oil  condensate and ngls is currently generating increased demand for our fractionation services and for related fee based services provided by our downstream business 
while we expect development activity to remain robust with respect to oil and liquids rich gas development and production  currently depressed natural gas prices have resulted in reduced activity levels surrounding comparatively dry natural gas reserves  whether conventional or unconventional 
commodity prices 
current forward commodity prices as of december  show natural gas prices strengthening while ngl and crude oil prices weaken on an absolute price basis 
various industry commodity price forecasts based on fundamental analysis may differ significantly from forward market prices 
both are subject to change due to multiple factors 
there has been and we believe there will continue to be significant volatility in commodity prices and in the relationships among ngl  crude oil and natural gas prices 
in addition  the volatility and uncertainty of natural gas  crude oil and ngl prices impact drilling  completion and other investment decisions by producers and ultimately supply to our systems 
our operating income generally improves in an environment of higher natural gas  ngl and condensate prices  primarily as a result of our percent of proceeds contracts 
our processing profitability is largely dependent upon pricing and market demand for natural gas  ngls and condensate  which are beyond our control and have been volatile 
recent weak economic conditions have negatively affected the pricing and market demand for natural gas  ngls and condensate  which caused a reduction in profitability of our processing operations 
in a declining commodity price environment  without taking into account our hedges  we will realize a reduction in cash flows under our percent of proceeds contracts proportionate to average price declines 
we have attempted to mitigate our exposure to commodity price movements by entering into hedging arrangements 
for additional information regarding our hedging activities  see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk 
volatile capital markets 
we are dependent on our ability to access the equity and debt capital markets in order to fund acquisitions and expansion expenditures 
global financial markets have been  and are expected to continue to be  volatile and disrupted and weak economic conditions may cause a significant decline in commodity prices 
as a result  we may be unable to raise equity or debt capital on satisfactory terms  or at all  which may negatively impact the timing and extent to which we execute growth plans 
prolonged periods of low commodity prices or volatile capital markets may impact our ability or willingness to enter into new hedges  fund organic growth  connect to new supplies of natural gas  execute acquisitions or implement expansion capital expenditures 
increased regulation 
additional regulation in various areas has the potential to materially impact our operations and financial condition 
for example  increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing used by producers may cause reductions in supplies of natural gas and of ngls from producers 
please read risk factors increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing could result in reductions or delays in drilling and completing new oil and natural gas wells  which could adversely impact our revenues by decreasing the volumes of natural gas that we gather  process and fractionate 
similarly  the forthcoming rules and regulations of the cftc may limit our ability or increase the cost to use derivatives  which could create more volatility and less predictability in our results of operations 
please read risk factors the recent adoption of derivatives legislation by the united states congress could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price  interest rate and other risks associated with our business 

table of contents distributions to our unitholders we intend to make cash distributions to our unitholders and our general partner of at least the minimum quarterly distribution rate of per common unit per quarter per common unit on an annualized basis

how we evaluate our operations our profitability is a function of the difference between i the revenues we receive from our operations  including fee based revenues from services and revenues from the natural gas  ngls and condensate we sell  and ii the costs associated with conducting our operations  including the costs of wellhead natural gas and mixed ngls that we purchase as well as operating and general and administrative costs and the impact of our commodity hedging activities 
because commodity price movements tend to impact both revenues and costs  increases or decreases in our revenues alone are not necessarily indicative of increases or decreases in our profitability 
our contract portfolio  the prevailing pricing environment for natural gas and ngls and the volumes of natural gas and ngl throughput on our systems are important factors in determining our profitability 
our profitability is also affected by the ngl content in gathered wellhead natural gas  supply and demand for our products and services and changes in our customer mix 

table of contents aside from commodity based revenues  our profitability is also impacted by fee based revenues 
our growth strategy  largely based on third party acquisitions of businesses and assets as well as expansion of our existing facilities  emphasizes assets that generate fee based revenues 
fixed fees for services such as storage and terminaling are more attractive to our investors because these revenues are not susceptible to changes in market prices for commodities or to changes in the efficiency of our operational environments 
our management uses a variety of financial measures and operational measurements to analyze our performance 
these include throughput volumes  facility efficiencies and fuel consumption  operating expenses and the following non gaap measures gross margin  operating margin  adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow 
throughput volumes  facility efficiencies and fuel consumption 
our profitability is impacted by our ability to add new sources of natural gas supply to offset the natural decline of existing volumes from natural gas wells that are connected to our gathering and processing systems 
this is achieved by connecting new wells and adding new volumes in existing areas of production  as well as by capturing natural gas supplies currently gathered by third parties 
similarly  our profitability is impacted by our ability to add new sources of mixed ngl supply  typically connected by third party transportation  to our downstream business fractionation facilities 
we fractionate ngls generated by our gathering and processing plants  as well as by contracting for mixed ngl supply from third party gathering  fractionation and exporting facilities 
in addition  we seek to increase operating margin by limiting volume losses and reducing fuel consumption by increasing compression efficiency 
with our gathering systems extensive use of remote monitoring capabilities  we monitor the volumes of natural gas received at the wellhead or central delivery points along our gathering systems  the volume of natural gas received at our processing plant inlets and the volumes of ngls and residue natural gas recovered by our processing plants 
we also monitor the volumes of ngls received  stored  fractionated and delivered across our logistics assets 
this information is tracked through our processing plants and downstream business facilities to determine customer settlements for sales and volume related fees for service and helps us increase efficiency and reduce fuel consumption 
as part of monitoring the efficiency of our operations  we measure the difference between the volume of natural gas received at the wellhead or central delivery points on our gathering systems and the volume received at the inlet of our processing plants as an indicator of fuel consumption and line loss 
we also track the difference between the volume of natural gas received at the inlet of the processing plant and the ngls and residue gas produced at the outlet of such plant to monitor the fuel consumption and recoveries of the facilities 
similar tracking is performed for our logistics assets 
these volume  recovery and fuel consumption measurements are an important part of our operational efficiency analysis 
operating expenses 
operating expenses are costs associated with the operation of a specific asset 
labor  contract services  repair and maintenance  utilities and ad valorem taxes comprise the most significant portion of our operating expenses 
these expenses  other than fuel and power  generally remain relatively stable and independent of the volumes through our systems but fluctuate depending on the scope of the activities performed during a specific period 
gross margin 
we define gross margin as revenues less purchases 
it is impacted by volumes and commodity prices as well as by our contract mix and hedging program 
we define natural gas gathering and processing gross margin as total operating revenues from the sales of natural gas and ngls plus service fee revenues  less product purchases  which consist primarily of producer payments and other natural gas purchases 
logistics assets gross margin consists primarily of service fee revenue 
gross margin for marketing and distribution equals total revenue from service fees and ngl sales  less cost of sales  which consists primarily of ngl purchases  transportation costs and changes in inventory valuation 
the gross margin impacts of cash flow hedge settlements are reported in other 
operating margin 
operating margin is an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations 
we define operating margin as gross margin less operating expenses 
natural gas and ngl sales revenue includes settlement gains and losses on commodity hedges 

table of contents gross margin and operating margin are non gaap measures 
the gaap measure most directly comparable to gross margin and operating margin is net income 
gross margin and operating margin are not alternatives to gaap net income and have important limitations as analytical tools 
investors should not consider gross margin and operating margin in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
because gross margin and operating margin exclude some  but not all  items that affect net income and are defined differently by different companies in our industry  our definition of gross margin and operating margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies  thereby diminishing their utility 
management reviews business segment gross margin and operating margin monthly as a core internal management process 
we believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses in evaluating our operating results 
gross margin and operating margin provide useful information to investors because they are used as supplemental financial measures by us and by external users of our financial statements  including investors and commercial banks  to assess the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods  capital structure or historical cost basis  our operating performance and return on capital as compared to other companies in the midstream energy sector  without regard to financing or capital structure  and the viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities 
management compensates for the limitations of gross margin and operating margin as analytical tools by reviewing the comparable gaap measures  understanding the differences between the measures and incorporating these insights into its decision making processes 
adjusted ebitda 
we define adjusted ebitda as net income before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  gains or losses on debt repurchases and non cash risk management activities related to derivative instruments 
adjusted ebitda is used as a supplemental financial measure by us and by external users of our financial statements such as investors  commercial banks and others 
the economic substance behind our use of adjusted ebitda is to measure the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to pay interest costs  support our indebtedness and make distributions to our investors 
the gaap measures most directly comparable to adjusted ebitda are net cash provided by operating activities and net income 
adjusted ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to gaap net cash provided by operating activities or gaap net income 
adjusted ebitda is not a presentation made in accordance with gaap and has important limitations as an analytical tool 
investors should not consider adjusted ebitda in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
because adjusted ebitda excludes some  but not all  items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities and is defined differently by different companies in our industry  our definition of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
management compensates for the limitations of adjusted ebitda as an analytical tool by reviewing the comparable gaap measures  understanding the differences between the measures and incorporating these insights into its decision making processes 
distributable cash flow 
we define distributable cash flow as net income attributable to targa resources partners lp plus depreciation and amortization  deferred taxes and amortization of debt issue costs included in interest expense  adjusted for non cash losses gains on mark to market derivative contracts and debt repurchases  less maintenance capital expenditures net of any reimbursements of project costs 
the impact of noncontrolling interests is included in this measure 

table of contents distributable cash flow is a significant performance metric used by us and by external users of our financial statements  such as investors  commercial banks and research analysts  to compare basic cash flows generated by us prior to the establishment of any retained cash reserves by the board of directors of our general partner to the cash distributions we expect to pay our unitholders 
using this metric  management and external users of our financial statements can quickly compute the coverage ratio of estimated cash flows to planned cash distributions 
distributable cash flow is also an important financial measure for our unitholders since it serves as an indicator of our success in providing a cash return on investment 
specifically  this financial measure indicates to investors whether or not we are generating cash flow at a level that can sustain or support an increase in our quarterly distribution rates 
distributable cash flow is also a quantitative standard used throughout the investment community with respect to publicly traded partnerships and limited liability companies because the value of a unit of such an entity is generally determined by the unit s yield which in turn is based on the amount of cash distributions the entity pays to a unitholder 
the gaap measure most directly comparable to distributable cash flow is net income attributable to targa resources partners lp 
distributable cash flow should not be considered as an alternative to gaap net income attributable to targa resources partners lp 
distributable cash flow is not a presentation made in accordance with gaap and has important limitations as an analytical tool

in millions gross margin operating margin other contains the financial effects of our hedging program on profitability 
it typically represents the cash settlements on our derivative contracts 
other also includes deferred gains or losses on previously terminated or de designated hedge contracts that are reclassified to revenues upon the occurrence of the underlying physical transactions 
the primary purpose of our commodity risk management activities is to manage our exposure to commodity price risk and reduce volatility in our operating cash flow due to fluctuations in commodity prices 
we have hedged the commodity price associated with a portion of our expected natural gas  ngl and condensate equity volumes by entering into derivative financial instruments 
because we are essentially forward selling a portion of our plant equity volumes  these hedge positions will move favorably in periods of falling prices and unfavorably in periods of rising prices

liquidity and capital resources our ability to finance our operations  including funding capital expenditures and acquisitions  to meet our indebtedness obligations  to refinance our indebtedness and to meet our collateral requirements will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
our ability to generate cash is subject to a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control  including weather  commodity prices  particularly for natural gas and ngls  and our ongoing efforts to manage operating costs and maintenance capital expenditures  as well as general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors 
our main sources of liquidity and capital resources are internally generated cash flow from operations  borrowings under our revolver  the issuance of additional common units and access to debt markets 
the capital markets continue to experience volatility 
many financial institutions have had liquidity concerns  prompting government intervention to mitigate pressure on the credit markets 
our exposure to current credit conditions includes our credit facility  cash investments and counterparty performance risks 
continued volatility in the debt markets may increase costs associated with issuing debt instruments due to increased spreads over relevant interest rate benchmarks and affect our ability to access those markets 
as of february   our liquidity of billion consisted of million of cash on hand and billion of available borrowings under our credit facility 
we continually monitor our liquidity and the credit markets  as well as events and circumstances surrounding each of the lenders in our credit facility 

table of contents we may issue additional equity or debt securities to assist us in meeting future liquidity and capital spending requirements 
we have filed with the sec a universal shelf registration statement that  subject to effectiveness at the time of use  allows us to issue up to an aggregate of million of debt or equity securities the shelf 
as of december   we had million of available securities under the shelf 
on october   we filed a prospectus supplement under the shelf that allows us to issue common units  representing limited partner interests having an aggregate offering price of up to million from time to time through an equity distribution agreement with citigroup global markets  inc sales of common units  if any  will be by means of ordinary brokers transactions through the facilities of the nyse at market prices  in block transactions or as otherwise agreed between us and the sales agent 
the shelf expires in july we also have filed with the sec a universal shelf registration statement the shelf  which provides us with the ability to offer and sell an unlimited amount of debt and equity securities  subject to market conditions and our capital needs 
our april  august  january and january equity offerings were conducted under the shelf 
subsequent events 
on january   we completed a public offering of  common units under our shelf at a price of per common unit per common unit  net of underwriting discounts 
as part of this offering  a wholly owned subsidiary of targa purchased  common units with an aggregate value of million based on the offering price of 
targa s units purchased were not subject to any underwriter discounts or commissions 
net proceeds from this offering were approximately million 
pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters overallotment option  we sold an additional  common units to the underwriters  providing net proceeds of approximately million 
in addition  our general partner contributed million for  general partner units to maintain its general partner interest 
on january  we privately placed million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes the notes due the notes resulted in approximately million of net proceeds  which was used to reduce borrowings under our revolver and for general partnership purposes 
risk management 
we continue to evaluate counterparty risks related to our commodity derivative contracts and trade credit 
we have all of our commodity derivatives with major financial institutions or major oil companies 
should any of these financial counterparties not perform  we may not realize the benefit of some of our hedges under lower commodity prices  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation 
we sell our natural gas  ngls and condensate to a variety of purchasers 
non performance by a trade creditor could result in losses 
crude oil and natural gas prices are also volatile 
in an effort to reduce the variability of our cash flows  we have hedged the commodity price associated with a portion of our expected natural gas and ngl equity volumes through and our condensate equity volumes through by entering into derivative financial instruments including swaps and purchased puts or floors 
with these arrangements  we have attempted to mitigate our exposure to commodity price movements with respect to our forecasted volumes for this period 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk 
the current market conditions may also impact our ability to enter into future commodity derivative contracts 
a significant reduction in commodity prices could reduce our operating margins and cash flow from operations to the extent that such operating margins and cash flows derive from the portion of equity volumes that are not hedged 
our risk management position has moved from a net liability of million at december  to a net liability of million at december  we terminated all of our interest rate swap contracts in september  which eliminated a liability of million from our books 
additionally  forward prices for natural gas are below the fixed prices we receive on those derivative contracts  creating an asset valued at million  while forward prices on crude oil and ngls are above the fixed prices we receive on those derivative contracts  creating a liability valued at million 
consequently  our expected future receipts on derivative contracts are less than our expected future payments  creating a net liability of million 
we account for derivatives that mitigate commodity price risk as cash flow hedges 
changes in fair value are deferred in oci until the underlying hedged transactions settle 
working capital 
working capital is the amount by which current assets exceed current liabilities 
our working capital is primarily impacted by changes in inventory  which is closely managed to maintain minimum levels 
on a consolidated basis at the end of any given month  accounts receivable and payable tied to commodity sales and purchases are relatively balanced with downstream business receivables from ngl customers offset by plant settlements payable owed producers 

table of contents our cash generated from operations has been sufficient to finance our operating expenditures and both acquisition and non acquisition related capital expenditures 
based on our anticipated levels of operations and absent any disruptive events  we believe that internally generated cash flow  borrowings available under our revolver and proceeds from unit offerings and debt offerings should provide sufficient resources to finance our operations  capital expenditures  long term debt obligations  collateral requirements and minimum quarterly cash distribution for at least the next twelve months 
a significant portion of our capital resources may be utilized in the form of letters of credit to satisfy certain counterparty credit requirements 
while our credit rating has improved this year  these letters of credit reflect our non investment grade status  as assigned to us by moody s investors service  inc and standard poor s corporation  and counterparties views of our financial condition and ability to satisfy our performance obligations  as well as commodity prices and other factors 
at december   our total outstanding letter of credit postings were million

table of contents cash receipts from derivative counterparties were lower in compared to because commodity prices  although higher than the fixed prices we receive on derivative contracts  were closer to the fixed prices compared to  when commodity prices were much higher than the fixed prices of our contracts 
the changes in general and administrative cash payments primarily result from the timing differences in settlements between us and targa  especially those related to allocations of incentive and long term compensation programs and insurance  which  for the most part  we do not fund until targa makes payments to participants or providers 
cash flow from investing activities net cash used in investing activities increased by million for compared to the increase was primarily due to our petroleum logistics acquisitions of million and a million increase in expansion capital projects in gathering and processing assets and in fractionation capacity 
we also invested million in equity contributions associated with the expansion of fractionation capacity at gcf 
net cash used in investing activities increased by million for compared to the increase is attributable to higher capital expenditures in compared to cash flow from financing activities net cash provided by financing activities for was million compared to net cash used in financing activities of million for the increase was due to two primary factors changes in our equity offerings and financing activities and distributions 
net proceeds from public offerings  issuance of senior notes and borrowings under our credit facility less repayments on our credit facility increased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  our primary financing activities that occurred during the year ended december  were on january   we completed a public offering of  common units under an existing shelf registration statement on form s at a price of per common unit per common unit  net of underwriting discounts  providing net proceeds of million 
pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters overallotment option  on february  we issued an additional  common units  providing net proceeds of approximately million 
in addition  our general partner contributed million for  general partner units to maintain its general partner interest 
on february   we closed a private placement of million in aggregate principal amount of our notes resulting in net proceeds of million 
on february   we exchanged an additional million principal amount of our notes for million aggregate principal amount of our notes 
in conjunction with the exchange we paid a cash premium of million including million of accrued interest 
net cash from the completion of the unit offering and the note offering less cash paid in connection with the exchange offer was used to reduce outstanding borrowings under our revolver by million 
net cash used in financing decreased million for compared to the decrease was primarily due to the purchase from targa of the permian business and straddle assets and targa s interests in versado and vesco  the repayment to targa of million in affiliate and allocated indebtedness  including interest  and net borrowings under our revolver increasing by million in compared to  partially offset by cash distributions to unitholders  including our general partner and incentive distribution rights  increased million in

a significant portion of the cost of constructing new gathering lines to connect to our gathering system is generally paid for by the natural gas producer 
however  we expect to make significant expenditures during the next year for the construction of additional natural gas gathering and processing infrastructure and the expansion of our logistics assets 
we categorize our capital expenditures as either i maintenance expenditures or ii expansion expenditures 
maintenance capital expenditures are those expenditures that are necessary to maintain the service capability of our existing assets including the replacement of system components and equipment which is worn  obsolete or completing its useful life  the addition of new sources of natural gas supply to our systems to replace natural gas production declines and expenditures to remain in compliance with environmental laws and regulations 
expansion capital expenditures improve the service capability of the existing assets  extend asset useful lives  increase capacities from existing levels  add capabilities  reduce costs or enhance revenues  and fund acquisitions of businesses or assets 
capital expenditures in millions business acquisitions expansion maintenance we estimate that our total capital expenditures for will be approximately million gross and million net of noncontrolling interest share and reimbursements 
we also estimate that of the million net capital expenditures  approximately will be for maintenance capital expenditures 
given our objective of growth through acquisitions  expansions of existing assets and other internal growth projects  we anticipate that over time we will invest significant amounts of capital to grow and acquire assets 
major capital projects include million expansion project at cbf to add a fourth fractionation train and related infrastructure enhancements at mont belvieu  million expansion of our mont belvieu complex and our existing import export marine terminal at galena park to export international grade propane  million north texas longhorn project for a new cryogenic processing plant with associated projects  million expansion of our petroleum logistics assets  million capital expansion programs to expand the gathering and processing capability of saou and the permian business  million benzene treating project at mont belvieu to construct a treater designed to reduce benzene content of natural gasoline to meet new  more stringent environmental standards  
table of contents million capital expansion program to expand the gathering and processing capability of the north texas system  million hd refrigeration export project to expand our dock facilities and related infrastructure enhancements at galena park  and our share of the million expansion at gulf coast fractionators  which is expected to be approximately million funded via cash calls and suspended interim earnings distributions 
these capital projects will extend through for a detailed discussion of these projects  see item business overview 
future expansion capital expenditures may vary significantly based on investment opportunities 
we expect to fund future capital expenditures with funds generated from our operations  borrowings under our revolver  and proceeds from the issuance of additional common units and debt offerings

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the policies and estimates discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application requires the most significant judgments from management in estimating matters for financial reporting that are inherently uncertain 
see the description of our accounting policies in the notes to the financial statements for additional information about our critical accounting policies and estimates 
property  plant and equipment 
in general  depreciation is the systematic and rational allocation of an asset s cost  less its residual value if any  to the period it benefits 
our property  plant and equipment are depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
our estimate of depreciation incorporates assumptions regarding the useful economic lives and residual values of our assets 
at the time we place our assets in service  we believe such assumptions are reasonable  however  circumstances may develop that would cause us to change these assumptions  which would change our depreciation amounts prospectively 
examples of such circumstances include changes in energy prices  changes in competition  changes in laws and regulations that limit the estimated economic life of an asset  changes in technology that render an asset obsolete  changes in expected salvage values  and changes in the forecast life of applicable resources basins 

table of contents as of december   the net book value of our property  plant and equipment was billion and we recorded million in depreciation and amortization expense for the weighted average life of our long lived assets is approximately years 
if the useful lives of these assets were found to be shorter than originally estimated  depreciation expense may increase  liabilities for future asset retirement obligations may be insufficient and impairments in carrying values of tangible and intangible assets may result 
for example  if the depreciable lives of our assets were reduced by  we estimate that depreciation expense would increase by million per year  which would result in a corresponding reduction in our operating income 
in addition  if an assessment of impairment resulted in a reduction of of our long lived assets  our operating income would decrease by million in the year of the impairment 
there have been no material changes impacting estimated useful lives of the assets 
revenue recognition 
as of december   our balance sheet reflects total accounts receivable from third parties of million 
we have recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  of million 
our exposure to uncollectible accounts receivable relates to the financial health of our counterparties 
we have an active credit management process which is focused on controlling loss exposure to bankruptcies or other liquidity issues of counterparties 
if an assessment of uncollectible accounts resulted in a reduction of our third party accounts receivable  our annual operating income would decrease by million in the year of the assessment 
price risk management hedging 
our net income and cash flows are subject to volatility stemming from changes in commodity prices and interest rates 
to reduce the volatility of our cash flows  we have entered into derivative financial instruments related to a portion of our equity volumes to manage the purchase and sales prices of commodities 
we are exposed to the credit risk of our counterparties in these derivative financial instruments 
we also monitor ngl inventory levels with a view to mitigating losses related to downward price exposure 
our cash flow is affected by the derivative financial instruments we enter into to the extent these instruments are settled by i making or receiving a payment to from the counterparty or ii making or receiving a payment for entering into a contract that exactly offsets the original derivative financial instrument 
typically a derivative financial instrument is settled when the physical transaction that underlies the derivative financial instrument occurs 
one of the primary factors that can affect our operating results each period is the price assumptions used to value our derivative financial instruments  which are reflected at their fair values in the balance sheet 
the relationship between the derivative financial instruments and the hedged item must be highly effective in achieving the offset of changes in cash flows attributable to the hedged risk both at the inception of the derivative financial instrument and on an ongoing basis 
hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively when a derivative financial instrument becomes ineffective 
gains and losses deferred in other comprehensive income related to cash flow hedges for which hedge accounting has been discontinued remain deferred until the forecasted transaction occurs 
if it is probable that a hedged forecasted transaction will not occur  deferred gains or losses on the derivative financial instrument are reclassified to earnings immediately 
the estimated fair value of our derivative financial instruments was a net liability of million as of december   net of an adjustment for credit risk 
the credit risk adjustment is based on the default probabilities by year as indicated by the counterparties credit default swap transactions 
these default probabilities have been applied to the unadjusted fair values of the derivative financial instruments to arrive at the credit risk adjustment  which aggregates to million as of december  we have an active credit management process which is focused on controlling loss exposure to bankruptcies or other liquidity issues of counterparties 
if a financial instrument counterparty were to declare bankruptcy  we would be exposed to the loss of fair value of the financial instrument transaction with that counterparty 
ignoring our adjustment for credit risk  if a bankruptcy by a financial instrument counterparty impacted of the fair value of our commodity based financial instruments that are in an asset position  we estimate that our operating income would decrease by million in the year of the bankruptcy 
use of estimates 
when preparing financial statements in conformity with gaap  management must make estimates and assumptions based on information available at the time 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements 
estimates and judgments are based on information available at the time such estimates and judgments are made 
adjustments made with respect to the use of these estimates and judgments often relate to information not previously available 
uncertainties with respect to such estimates and judgments are inherent in the preparation of financial statements 
estimates and judgments are used in  among other things  estimating unbilled revenues  product purchases and operating and general and administrative costs  developing fair value assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows and discount rates  analyzing long lived assets for possible impairment  estimating the useful lives of assets and determining amounts to accrue for contingencies  guarantees and indemnifications 
actual results  therefore  could differ materially from estimated amounts 
accounting pronouncements 
for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements that will affect us  see accounting pronouncements included under note to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page f in this annual report 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal market risks are our exposure to changes in commodity prices  particularly to the prices of natural gas and ngls  changes in interest rates  as well as nonperformance by our customers 
we do not use risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
commodity price risk 
a majority of our revenues are derived from percent of proceeds contracts under which we receive a portion of the natural gas and or ngl equity volumes  as payment for services 
the prices of natural gas and ngls are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply  demand  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors beyond our control 
we monitor these risks and enter into hedging transactions designed to mitigate the impact of commodity price fluctuations on our business 
cash flows from a derivative instrument designated as a hedge are classified in the same category as the cash flows from the item being hedged 
the primary purpose of our commodity risk management activities is to hedge the exposure to commodity price risk and reduce fluctuations in our operating cash flow despite fluctuations in commodity prices 
in an effort to reduce the variability of our cash flows  as of december   we have hedged the commodity price associated with a portion of our expected natural gas  ngl and condensate equity volumes that result from our percent of proceeds processing arrangements in field gathering and processing  and the lou portion of the coastal gathering and processing operations through by entering into derivative financial instruments including swaps and purchased puts or floors 
the percentages of expected equity volumes that are hedged decrease over time 
with swaps  we typically receive an agreed fixed price for a specified notional quantity of natural gas or ngl and we pay the hedge counterparty a floating price for that same quantity based upon published index prices 
since we receive from our customers substantially the same floating index price from the sale of the underlying physical commodity  these transactions are designed to effectively lock in the agreed fixed price in advance for the volumes hedged 
in order to avoid having a greater volume hedged than our actual equity volumes  we typically limit our use of swaps to hedge the prices of less than our expected natural gas and ngl equity volumes 
we utilize purchased puts or floors to hedge additional expected equity commodity volumes without creating volumetric risk 
we intend to continue to manage our exposure to commodity prices in the future by entering into similar derivative transactions using swaps  collars  purchased puts or floors or other derivative instruments as market conditions permit 
we have tailored our hedges to generally match the ngl product composition and the ngl and natural gas delivery points to those of our physical equity volumes 
our ngl hedges cover specific ngl products based upon our expected equity ngl composition 
we believe this strategy avoids uncorrelated risks resulting from employing hedges on crude oil or other petroleum products as proxy hedges of ngl prices 
our ngl hedges fair values are based on published index prices for delivery at mont belvieu through our natural gas hedges fair values are based on published index prices for delivery at various locations which closely approximate the actual ngl and natural gas delivery points 
a portion of our condensate sales are hedged using crude oil hedges that are based on the nymex futures contracts for west texas intermediate light  sweet crude 
these commodity price hedging transactions are typically documented pursuant to a standard international swap dealers association form with customized credit and legal terms 
our principal counterparties or  if applicable  their guarantors have investment grade credit ratings 
our payment obligations in connection with substantially all of these hedging transactions and any additional credit exposure due to a rise in natural gas and ngl prices relative to the fixed prices set forth in the hedges are secured by a first priority lien in the collateral securing our senior secured indebtedness that ranks equal in right of payment with liens granted in favor of our senior secured lenders 
absent federal regulations requiring the deposit of cash collateral resulting from the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act  and as long as this first priority lien is in effect  we expect to have no obligation to post cash  letters of credit or other additional collateral to secure these hedges at any time  even if our counterparty s exposure to our credit increases over the term of the hedge as a result of higher commodity prices or because there has been a change in our creditworthiness 
a purchased put or floor transaction does not expose our counterparties to credit risk  as we have no obligation to make future payments beyond the premium paid to enter into the transaction 
we are exposed to the risk of default by the counterparty  which is the risk that the counterparty will not honor its obligation under the put transaction 
for all periods presented we have entered into hedging arrangements for a portion of our forecasted equity volumes 
floor volumes and floor pricing are based solely on purchased puts or floors 
during the years ended december   and  our operating revenues were increased decreased by net hedge adjustments on commodity derivative contracts of million  million and million

table of contents these contracts may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances 
our hedging arrangements provide us protection on the hedged volumes if prices decline below the prices at which these hedges are set 
if prices rise above the prices at which we have hedged  we will receive less revenue on the hedged volumes than we would receive in the absence of hedges 
we account for the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities using a three tier fair value hierarchy  which prioritizes the significant inputs used in measuring fair value 
these tiers include level  defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets  level  defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable  and level  defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists  therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions 
we determine the value of our ngl derivative contracts utilizing a discounted cash flow model for swaps and a standard option pricing model for options based on inputs that are readily available in public markets 
for the ngl contracts that have inputs from quoted prices  the classification of these instruments is level within the fair value hierarchy 
for those ngl contracts which we are unable to obtain quoted prices for at least of the full term of the commodity swap and options  the ngl valuations are classified as level within the fair value hierarchy 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report for more information regarding classifications within the fair value hierarchy 
interest rate risk 
we are exposed to the risk of changes in interest rates as a result of variable rate borrowings under our revolver 
to the extent that interest rates increase  interest expense for our revolving debt will also increase 
as of december   we had variable rate borrowings of million 
a hypothetical change of basis points in the interest rate of our variable rate debt would impact our annual interest expense by million 
counterparty credit risk 
we are subject to risk of losses resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our counterparties 
the credit exposure related to commodity derivative instruments is represented by the fair value of the asset position ie the fair value of expected future receipts at the reporting date 
should the creditworthiness of one or more of the counterparties decline  our ability to mitigate nonperformance risk is limited to a counterparty agreeing to either a voluntary termination and subsequent cash settlement or a novation of the derivative contract to a third party 
in the event of a counterparty default  we may sustain a loss and our cash receipts could be negatively impacted 
as of december   affiliates of barclays plc barclays  credit suisse ag credit suisse  natixis and jp morgan chase bank na jp morgan accounted for   and of our counterparty credit exposure related to commodity derivative instruments 
barclays  credit suisse  natixis and jp morgan are major financial institutions that possess investment grade credit ratings based upon minimum credit ratings assigned by moody s investors service  inc and standard poor s corporation 
customer credit risk 
we extend credit to customers and other parties in the normal course of business 
we have established various procedures to manage our credit exposure  including initial credit approvals  credit limits and terms  letters of credit and rights of offset 
we also use prepayments and guarantees to limit credit risk to ensure that our established credit criteria are met
