item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general market risk represents the risk of changes in the value of a financial instrument  derivative or non derivative  caused by fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and equity prices 
as discussed below  management of the company does not believe that changes in these factors could cause material fluctuations in the company s results of operations or cash flows 
the ability to import furniture products can be adversely affected by political issues in the countries where suppliers are located  disruptions associated with shipping distances and negotiations with port employees 
other risks related to furniture product importation include government imposition of regulations and or quotas  duties and taxes on imports  and significant fluctuation in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies 
any of these factors could interrupt supply  increase costs and decrease earnings 
inflation increased operating costs are reflected in product or services pricing with any limitations on price increases determined by the marketplace 
inflation or other pricing pressures could impact raw material costs  labor costs and interest rates which are important components of costs for the company and could have an adverse effect on our profitability  especially where increases in these costs exceed price increases on finished products 
foreign currency risk during fiscal years  and  the company did not have sales  purchases  or other expenses denominated in foreign currencies 
as such  the company is not directly exposed to market risk associated with currency exchange rates and prices 
interest rate risk the company s primary market risk exposure with regard to financial instruments is changes in interest rates 
at june   the company does not have any debt outstanding
