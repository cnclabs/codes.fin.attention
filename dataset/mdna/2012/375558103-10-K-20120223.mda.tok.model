business highlights during  we continued to advance our pipeline and internal programs across our therapeutic areas 
we augmented these efforts through strategic investments in acquisitions  in licensing opportunities and collaborations 
in the liver disease area  our acquisition of pharmasset inc pharmasset in early marks a significant opportunity to continue developing best in class drugs 
we believe the combination of our existing internal research programs and our recent partnerships and acquisitions will drive research and development efforts and accelerate our product pipeline so that we can continue to bring innovative therapies to individuals around the world who are living with unmet medical needs 
below is a summary of our key accomplishments received marketing approval for and began launching complera eviplera  our second single tablet regimen for the treatment of hiv in the united states  canada and certain countries of the european union  submitted new drug application nda for quad single tablet regimen of elvitegravir  cobicistat  emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for the treatment of hiv six weeks after the phase studies concluded  obtained us food and drug administration fda agreement for a revision of the letairis label  which subsequently changed the sales trajectory for the product  
table of contents progressed gs  an investigational nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor  and completed collaborative agreements in the hiv field which set the stage for a third generation of single tablet regimens  accelerated our timeline to develop the first all oral hcv regimen as a result of the pharmasset acquisition  and completed the arresto biosciences  inc arresto and calistoga pharmaceuticals  inc calistoga acquisitions and acquired the oceanside  california facility for biologics manufacturing to support advancing clinical studies in oncology 
new and potential product offerings and new drug applications in the area of hiv  we continued efforts to expand our product offerings of single tablet regimens with the launch of complera eviplera and submission of our quad for regulatory approval in the united states and europe 
in august  we received fda approval for complera for the treatment of hiv infection in treatment na ve adults 
complera combines three antiretroviral medications in one daily tablet our truvada  a fixed dose combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate  and edurant rilpivirine  marketed by tibotec pharmaceuticals tibotec 
in november  we received marketing approval for the product in europe  where the product is marketed as eviplera 
in october  we submitted a nda to the fda for the marketing approval of quad for the treatment of hiv infection in adults 
subsequently  the fda accepted the nda and has set a target review date of august  under the prescription drug user fee act pdufa 
the fda has indicated that a panel will be convened in may to provide expert advice on the application 
we submitted the marketing authorisation application for quad for the treatment of hiv infection in adults to the european medicines agency in november in december  we announced that phase clinical trials of our pharmacoenhancing or boosting agent cobicistat  met its week primary object of non inferiority 
cobicistat increases blood levels of certain hiv medicines to allow for one pill once daily dosing 
the study indicated that after weeks of treatment  percent of patients taking a regimen of cobicistat boosted atazanavir plus truvada achieved comparable results with patients taking ritonavir boosted atazanavir plus truvada 
also in december  we announced phase clinical trial results showing that elvitegravir  an integrase inhibitor being evaluated for the treatment of hiv infection  was non inferior to the integrase inhibitor raltegravir after two years of therapy in treatment experienced patients 
the results of the study indicate that elvitegravir has the potential to become a new once daily treatment option for those with hiv who have developed resistance to other therapies 
acquisitions in january  we completed the acquisition of arresto for million plus potential future payments based on achievement of certain sales levels 
arresto was a privately held  development stage biotechnology company based in palo alto  california  focused on developing antibodies for the potential treatment of fibrotic diseases and cancer 
the lead product from this acquisition was gs  a humanized monoclonal antibody mab targeting the human lysyl oxidase like loxl protein 
in addition to ongoing phase studies of gs in liver fibrosis  myelofibrosis  colorectal cancer and pancreatic cancer  a phase study is being conducted to evaluate gs in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 
in april  we acquired calistoga for million plus potential payments of up to million based on the achievement of certain milestones 
calistoga was a privately held  biotechnology company based in seattle  washington  focused on the development of medicines to treat cancer and inflammatory diseases 
the 
table of contents portfolio of proprietary compounds from this acquisition selectively targeted isoforms of phosphoinositide kinase pik 
calistoga s lead product candidate  gs  was a first in class specific inhibitor of the pik delta isoform 
pik delta is preferentially expressed in leukocytes involved in a variety of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases and hematological cancers 
in november  we entered into an agreement to acquire pharmasset for billion 
the acquisition was financed with cash on hand  bank debt and senior unsecured notes 
the acquisition was completed in january pharmasset was a clinical stage pharmaceutical company located in princeton  new jersey  committed to discovering  developing and commercializing novel drugs to treat viral infections 
pharmasset s primary focus was the development of oral therapeutics for the treatment of hcv 
pharmasset s research and development r d efforts were focused on nucleoside tide analogs  a class of compounds that act as alternative substrates for the viral polymerase  thus inhibiting viral replication 
in licensing and collaborations in june  we entered into an agreement with tibotec for the development and commercialization of a new fixed dose combination product containing our cobicistat and tibotec s protease inhibitor prezista darunavir  indicated for the treatment of hiv 
prezista is currently co administered with ritonavir in combination with other antiretroviral agents 
in october  we entered into an agreement with boehringer ingelheim bi for worldwide rights for the research  development and commercialization of bi s novel non catalytic site integrase inhibitors for hiv 
this includes the lead compound bi  which has been evaluated in a phase a dose escalation study to assess bioavailability and pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers 
also in october  we entered into an agreement with globeimmune  inc for the license  development and commercialization of therapeutic vaccine products for use in conjunction with viread and other oral therapies for the treatment of the chronic hbv infection 
also in october  we entered into an agreement with bristol myers squibb company bms for the licensing  development and commercialization of a fixed dose combination containing bms s protease inhibitor reyataz atazanavir sulfate and our cobicistat 
we are currently studying atazanavir and cobicistat in phase and studies in hiv treatment na ve patients 
in november  we entered into an agreement with tibotec for the development and commercialization of a single tablet regimen combining tibotec s prezista with our emtriva  gs and cobicistat 
financial highlights during  in spite of a challenging macroeconomic environment  we continued to grow our business and achieved total product sales of billion for  an increase of over the growth in product sales was primarily driven by growth in our antiviral franchise  where sales increased to billion when compared to the prior year 
sales of other products  which are comprised primarily of ambisome  ranexa and letairis reached billion  an increase of compared to the prior year 
total revenues during grew to billion 
our product sales growth was partially offset by a decline in royalty revenues from our collaborations with corporate partners  which were million for  a decrease of from primarily due to lower tamiflu royalties as pandemic planning initiatives worldwide have declined 
gross margin decreased from in to in primarily due to an annual selling price adjustment for the percentage share of atripla that is paid to our partner 
r d expenses were billion for and billion for  an increase of million  or 
the increase was due primarily to costs related to clinical studies and the impact of higher headcount and 
table of contents expenses associated with acquisitions  collaborations and the ongoing growth of our business 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were billion for and billion for  an increase of million  or 
the increase was due primarily to the increased expenses associated with the ongoing growth of our business  the pharmaceutical excise tax resulting from us healthcare reform and increased bad debt provision due to slower collections in certain southern european countries 
net income for was billion  a decrease from billion in due primarily to the investments we made in our existing clinical programs and through acquisitions  in licensing and collaboration agreements and lower tamiflu royalties from roche as a result of declining pandemic planning initiatives worldwide 
our diluted earnings per share increased by to in from in  which incorporates the impact of our share repurchases throughout the year 
financing activity cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by billion during to a total of billion at december  the primary sources of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities during were operating cash flows of billion and billion in proceeds from the issuance of senior unsecured notes  of which billion was raised in december of to partially fund the pharmasset acquisition 
key uses of cash during the year included billion for repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs  million for the repayment of our convertible senior notes due in and million for acquisition activities in during  we completed our may  billion stock repurchase program and commenced share repurchases under a three year  billion stock repurchase program authorized by our board of directors in january in  we spent a total of billion of cash to repurchase and retire million shares of our common stock at an average purchase price of per share 
subsequent events in january  we raised billion in bank debt to partially fund the acquisition of pharmasset 
we acquired pharmasset for billion through a cash tender offer and subsequent merger  which closed in january pharmasset s lead compound was a nucleotide analog in hcv infected individuals across genotypes now known as gs during  we expect to receive a significant amount of data from clinical trials evaluating gs on february   we announced that data indicates that gs with ribavirin for the treatment of genotype patients with a prior null response to an interferon containing regimen for weeks will not be sufficient to cure their disease 
we are currently conducting additional phase studies in hcv infected genotype patients  including treatment na ve patients  the results of which we expect at the end of the first quarter  in the second quarter and early in the third quarter of outlook our operating objectives for include increasing the market share of our commercial products  continuing to strengthen our pipeline with internally developed and or externally in licensed or purchased opportunities and strengthening our key alliances 
from an r d standpoint  we will continue to execute on our pipeline development with a particular focus on innovative hiv single tablet regimens for patients  progression of our hcv molecules into and through the clinic and new initiatives in oncology and inflammation 
in  we expect to publicly announce additional data sets related to the development of gs for treatment of hcv that will affect the cost and duration of our development efforts for gs 
table of contents from a commercial standpoint  we have a number of internal and external initiatives intended to promote the continued growth of our franchises 
in the hiv area  the scientific arguments to diagnose and treat patients earlier are strong and the reasons to use single tablet regimens are compelling both medically and practically 
the extension of the ryan white treatment act should provide stable funding for aids drug assistance programs adaps in the united states through during  we will continue to roll out complera eviplera around the world and  subject to fda approval of quad  bring our third single tablet regimen to individuals in the us living with hiv 
in  we launched the truvada rilpivirine single tablet regimen for treatment of hiv as complera in the united states and canada and as eviplera in the united kingdom and austria 
in  we expect continued uptake of complera in the united states and canada and to launch eviplera throughout europe 
our quad is being reviewed by the fda with a pdufa date of august  assuming approval  we expect to launch the product in september we expect quad to contribute incremental revenue to our hiv franchise 
in the hbv area  we will continue to support educational and promotional activities focused on us asian communities  highlighting the need to screen  diagnose and link patients to care 
in the cardiovascular area  we will continue in our efforts to raise awareness of gilead in the pulmonary arterial hypertension and cardiology communities and believe this will help grow revenues of letairis and ranexa in we are mindful that conditions in the current macroeconomic environment could affect our ability to achieve our goals 
some of the factors that could affect our business include future changes to healthcare reform in the united states  a continuation or worsening of global economic conditions  patent expirations of competitive products and the launch of generic competitors  continued government pricing pressures internationally and the potential volatility in foreign currency exchange rates 
we will continue to monitor these conditions and will adjust our business processes  as appropriate  to mitigate these risks to our business 
we believe the successes we experienced in have enabled us to continue to build a financially sound business model that will allow us to continue to further expand our commercial and r d activities and to maintain quality and compliance 
as we continue to grow our business  we remain focused on profitable revenue growth and prudent expense management that we believe will enable solid execution of our operating objectives for critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  intangible assets  allowance for doubtful accounts  prepaid royalties  clinical trial accruals  our tax provision and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific and other relevant assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition product sales we recognize revenues from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery to the customer has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
we record estimated reductions to revenues for government rebates such as medicaid reimbursements  customer incentives such as cash discounts for prompt payment  distributor fees and expected returns of expired products 
these estimates are deducted from gross product sales at the time such revenues are recognized 
of these reductions from gross product sales  government rebates significantly impact our reported net product sales and are based upon certain estimates that require complex and significant judgment by management 
government rebates we estimate reductions to our revenues for government managed medicaid programs as well as to certain other qualifying federal  state and foreign government programs for the reimbursement of portions of the retail price of prescriptions filled that are covered by these programs 
these reductions are settled either by us being invoiced directly or through charge backs from our wholesalers 
government rebates that are invoiced directly to us are recorded in accrued government rebates on our consolidated balance sheets 
for qualified programs that can purchase our products through wholesalers at a lower contractual government price  the wholesalers charge back to us the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower contractual government price  which we record as allowances against accounts receivable 
although we may pay rebates in countries outside of the united states  to date  payments made to foreign governments have not represented a significant portion of our total government rebates 
for government programs in the united states  we estimate these sales allowances based on contractual terms  historical utilization rates  new information regarding changes in these programs regulations and guidelines that would impact the amount of the actual rebates  our expectations regarding future utilization rates for these programs and channel inventory data obtained from our major us wholesalers in accordance with our inventory management agreements 
during   and  u 
s government rebates of billion  billion and million  respectively  representing  and of total gross product sales  respectively  were deducted from gross product sales 
we believe that the methodology that we use to estimate our sales allowances for government price reductions is reasonable and appropriate given the current facts and circumstances 
however  actual results may differ 
based on the current information available to us  actual government rebates claimed for these periods have varied by approximately from our estimates recorded in those periods 
as of december  and  we had accrued us government rebates of million and million  respectively  in accrued government rebates and had an allowance for government chargebacks of million and million  respectively  recorded against accounts receivable 
the following table summarizes the aggregate activity in our us government rebates allowance and accrued liabilities accounts balance at beginning of year charged to expense deducted from accruals balance at end of year year ended december  government rebates allowances and accrued liabilities activity related to sales activity related to sales prior to total year ended december  government rebates allowances and accrued liabilities activity related to sales activity related to sales prior to total 
table of contents intangible assets in conjunction with business combinations that we have completed  we have recorded intangible assets primarily related to marketed products  ipr d projects and goodwill as part of our recognition and measurement of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
identifiable intangible assets  such as those related to marketed products or ipr d projects  are measured at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date 
we believe the fair values assigned to our acquired intangible assets are based on reasonable estimates and assumptions given the available facts and circumstances as of the acquisition dates 
discounted cash flow models are used in valuing these intangible assets  and these models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the products or product candidates  the probability of success for unapproved product candidates considering their stages of development  the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of product candidates  the life of the potential commercialized products and associated risks  including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a product candidate such as obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals  and risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets 
goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
goodwill and intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized  but are required to be tested for impairment at least annually 
we test goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and in between annual tests if we become aware of any events occurring or changes in circumstances that would indicate a reduction in the fair values of the assets below their carrying amounts 
as of december   we had billion of indefinite lived intangible assets consisting of billion of goodwill resulting from various business combinations and million of intangible assets related to the ipr d projects that we acquired from arresto and calistoga 
intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment when facts or circumstances suggest that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
we are amortizing the intangible asset related to the ranexa product  which we acquired from cv therapeutics  over its estimated useful life using an amortization rate derived from our forecasted future product sales for ranexa 
our product sales forecasts are prepared annually and determined using our best estimates of future activity upon considering such factors as historical and expected future patient usage or uptake of our products  the introduction of complimentary or combination therapies or products and future product launch plans 
if a previously unanticipated and significant change occurs to our sales forecasts  we will prospectively update the rate used to amortize our intangible asset related to ranexa which may increase future cost of goods sold  as that is where we record the amortization expense 
we are amortizing the intangible asset related to the lexiscan product  which we also acquired from cv therapeutics  over its estimated useful life to cost of goods sold on a straight line basis 
given that current lexiscan revenues consist of royalties received from a collaboration partner and our lack of ongoing access and visibility into that partner s future sales forecasts  we cannot make a reasonable estimate of the amortization rate using a forecasted product sales approach 
as of december   we had million of net unamortized finite lived intangible assets consisting primarily of intangible assets related to the marketed products that we acquired from cv therapeutics 
our judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on our historical and projected future operating results  our extent or manner of use of the acquired assets  legal and regulatory factors and events  our overall business strategy and market and economic trends 
if events occur in the future that cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that certain intangible assets are impaired  our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted 

table of contents during the fourth quarter of  we recorded million of impairment charges related to certain ipr d assets acquired from cv therapeutics which we had no future plans to develop and which were deemed to have no future use to us or other market participants 
these charges related to the gs  adentri and tecadenoson programs and were recorded in r d expense 
the majority of the impairment charge related to our gs program  a product candidate that was in phase clinical studies for the treatment of diabetes and hypertriglyceridemia  which was terminated in the fourth quarter of due to unfavorable results from pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics tests that demonstrated limited effectiveness of the compound in patients 
given these results  we do not believe it has alternative future uses for us or other market participants 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded million of impairment charges related to certain ipr d assets acquired from cgi 
these impairment charges were a result of changes in the anticipated market share related to the syk compound 
allowance for doubtful accounts we also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this allowance is based on our analysis of several factors including  but not limited to  contractual payment terms  historical payment patterns of our customers and individual customer circumstances  an analysis of days sales outstanding by geographic region and a review of the local economic environment and its potential impact on government funding and reimbursement practices 
if the financial condition of our customers or the economic environment in which they operate were to deteriorate  resulting in an inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we believe that the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate  however  significant deterioration in any of the above factors could materially change these expectations and may result in an increase to our allowance for doubtful accounts 
prepaid royalties we capitalize royalties that we have prepaid at cost  specifically those related to the emtricitabine royalties we paid to emory university emory for the hiv indication  based on the present value of the future royalty obligation that we would expect to pay to emory assuming certain expected future levels of our product sales incorporating emtricitabine 
the present value of our future royalty obligation was derived using our weighted average cost of capital 
we review periodically the expected future sales levels of our products and any indicators that might require a write down in the net recoverable value of our asset or a change in the estimated life of the prepaid royalty 
some potential indicators of impairment include the launch of a significant product by a competitor  significant deviations in recognized product sales compared to forecast and product safety issues and recalls 
we amortize our prepaid royalties based on an effective royalty rate that we derive from forecasted future hiv product sales incorporating emtricitabine 
our product sales forecasts are prepared annually and determined using our best estimates of future activity upon considering such factors as historical and expected future patient usage or uptake of our products  the introduction of complimentary or combination therapies or products and future product launch plans 
if a previously unanticipated and significant change occurs to our sales forecasts  including the introduction of a competing product by us or one of our competitors in the same hiv market as emtricitabine  we will prospectively update the royalty rate used to amortize our prepaid royalties which may increase future cost of goods sold  as that is where we record the amortization expense 
as of december  and  we had a prepaid royalty asset relating to the emtricitabine royalties we paid to emory of million and million  respectively 
amortization expense relating to this prepaid royalty asset was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
clinical trial accruals we record accruals for estimated clinical study costs 
most of our clinical studies are performed by third party contract research organizations cros 
these costs are a significant component of r d expenses 
during 
table of contents  and  we incurred cro costs of million  million and million  respectively 
we accrue costs for clinical studies performed by cros over the service periods specified in the contracts and adjust our estimates  if required  based upon our ongoing review of the level of effort and costs actually incurred by the cros 
we validate our accruals quarterly with our vendors and perform detailed reviews of the activities related to our significant contracts 
based upon the results of these validation processes  we assess the appropriateness of our accruals and make any adjustments we deem necessary to ensure that our expenses reflect the actual effort incurred by the cros 
generally  a significant portion of the total clinical trial costs is associated with start up activities for the trial and patient enrollment 
we extensively outsource our clinical trial activities and usually perform only a small portion of the start up activities in house 
as a result  cros typically perform most of the total start up activities for our trials  including document preparation  site identification  screening and preparation  pre study visits  training and program management 
start up costs usually occur within a few months after the contract has been executed and are milestone or event driven in nature 
the remaining clinical activities and related costs  such as patient monitoring and administration  generally occur ratably throughout the life of the individual contract or study 
most contracts are negotiated as fixed per unit prices and can vary in length between three months for a single dose phase clinical study and up to two years or more for a more complex phase clinical study 
the average length of contracts in  and has been at the upper end of this range in order to provide long term safety and efficacy data to support the commercial launches of atripla  truvada  viread  complera eviplera  hepsera  emtriva  letairis and ranexa 
all of our material cro contracts are terminable by us upon written notice and we are generally only liable for actual effort expended by the cro and certain non cancelable expenses incurred at any point of termination 
amounts paid in advance relating to uncompleted services will be refunded to us if a contract is terminated 
some contracts may include additional termination payments that become due and payable if we terminate the contract 
such additional termination payments are only recorded if it becomes probable that a contract will be terminated 
through december   differences between actual and estimated activity levels for any particular study have not been material 
however  if management does not receive complete and accurate information from our vendors or underestimates activity levels associated with a study at a given point in time  we may have to record additional and potentially significant r d expenses in future periods 
tax provision we estimate our income tax provision  including deferred tax assets and liabilities  based on significant management judgment 
we evaluate the realization of all or a portion of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
we consider future taxable income  ongoing tax planning strategies and our historical financial performance in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
if we expect to realize deferred tax assets for which we have previously recorded a valuation allowance  we will reduce the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is first made 
our future effective income tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws  regulations or rates  changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations  the impact of accounting for stock based compensation  changes in our international organization and changes in overall levels of income before tax 
we record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions in accordance with the guidance that clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
we do not believe any such uncertain tax positions currently pending will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements  although an adverse resolution of one or more of these uncertain tax positions in any period could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period 

table of contents at december  and  we had total federal  state and foreign unrecognized tax benefits of million and million  respectively 
of the total unrecognized tax benefits  million and million at december  and  respectively  if recognized  would reduce our effective tax rate in the period of recognition 
as of december   we believe that it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will not significantly change in the next months as we do not expect to have clarification from the irs and other tax authorities around any of our uncertain tax positions 
we file federal  state and foreign income tax returns in many jurisdictions in the united states and abroad 
for federal income tax purposes  the statute of limitations is open for and onwards 
for certain acquired entities  the statute of limitations is open for all years from inception due to our utilization of their net operating losses and credits carried over from prior years 
for california income tax purposes  the statute of limitations is open for and onwards 
our income tax returns are audited by federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
we are currently under examination by the irs for the and tax years and by various state and foreign jurisdictions 
there are differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations  and as a result  significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions 
we periodically evaluate our exposures associated with our tax filing positions 
stock based compensation we measure all share based payments to employees and directors  including grants of stock options  based on their relative fair values 
fair values of awards granted under our stock option plans and employee stock purchase plan were estimated at grant or purchase dates using a black scholes option valuation model 
the black scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options  which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
in addition  option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including expected stock price volatility and expected award life 
fair value of our restricted stock units rsus is equal to the closing price of our common stock on the grant date 
our rsus vest ratably on an annual basis over five years from the grant date for awards granted prior to and four years from the grant date for awards granted in we also grant performance based restricted stock units which are valued using the monte carlo valuation method and vest upon the achievement of specified market and performance goals relative to a pre determined peer group 
the actual number of common shares ultimately issued is calculated by multiplying the number of performance units by a payout percentage ranging from to 
performance awards vest only when a committee or subcommittee of our board has determined that we have achieved our specified market and performance goals 
stock based compensation is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our consolidated statements of income using a graded vesting expense attribution approach for unvested stock options granted prior to january   and using the straight line expense attribution approach for stock options granted after our adoption of new guidance for share based payments to employees and directors on january  as stock based compensation expenses  related to stock options recognized on adoption of the new guidance  is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  gross expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
the guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we estimated forfeitures based on our historical experience 
prior to the adoption of this guidance  pro forma information that was required to be disclosed included forfeitures as they occurred 
as a result of the guidance adopted on january   we only recognize a tax benefit from stock based compensation in additional paid in capital apic if an incremental tax benefit is realized after all other tax attributes currently available to us have been utilized 
in addition  we have elected to account for the indirect benefits of stock based compensation on the research tax credit and the extraterritorial income deduction through our consolidated statements of income rather than through apic 
during the years ended december   and  we recognized stock based compensation expenses of million  million and million  respectively  in operating expenses  and we 
table of contents capitalized million  million and million  respectively  to inventory 
as of december   and  million  million and million of stock based compensation costs was included in inventory  respectively 
as of december   we had unrecognized stock based compensation expenses of million related to unvested stock options  which we expect to expense over an estimated weighted average period of years and we had unrecognized stock based compensation expenses of million related to rsus which we expect to expense over an estimated weighted average period of years 
results of operations total revenues we had total revenues of billion in  billion in and billion in included in total revenues were product sales  royalty revenues and contract and other revenues 
increases in total revenues were driven by growth in product sales 
total product sales were billion in  an increase of over total product sales of billion in  driven primarily by our antiviral franchise  resulting from the continued growth in sales of atripla and truvada 
the increase in product sales also reflected sales growth in our non antiviral products  primarily ambisome  ranexa  letairis and cayston  which reached billion mark in compared to million in in  the increase in our product sales was partially offset by a decline in our tamiflu royalties from roche  due to declining pandemic planning initiatives worldwide 
total product sales increased by in compared to billion in  primarily driven by growth of atripla and truvada sales 
product sales in the united states increased for compared to  primarily driven by the continued sales growth in our antiviral franchise and the introduction of complera  partially offset by the ongoing impact of us healthcare reform 
the increase also reflected sales growth in non antiviral franchises 
ranexa sales contributed million to our product sales  an increase of compared to letairis sales contributed million to our product sales  an increase of compared to cayston contributed million to our product sales  an increase of compared to product sales in europe increased for compared to  primarily driven by sales growth in our antiviral franchise 
this increase was partially offset by the impact of price reductions  due in part to austerity measures in certain european countries 
antiviral product sales in europe totaled billion in  an increase of compared to billion in  driven primarily by the sales of atripla and truvada

at december   we had firm purchase commitments related to active pharmaceutical ingredients and certain inventory related items 
these amounts include minimum purchase requirements and actual purchases are expected to significantly exceed these amounts 
in addition to the above  we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of licensing  collaboration and development arrangements 
payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental  regulatory and or commercial milestones 
because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable  such contingencies have not been recorded on our consolidated balance sheets and have not been included in the table above 
at december   we had several clinical studies in various clinical trial phases 
our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to cros 
although all of our material contracts with cros are cancelable  we historically have not cancelled such contracts 
these amounts reflect commitments based on existing contracts and do not reflect any future modifications to  or terminations of  existing contracts or anticipated or potential new contracts 
we had total gross unrecognized tax benefit liabilities of million as of december  we believe that it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will not significantly change in the next months as we do not expect to have clarification from the irs and other tax authorities around any of our uncertain tax positions 
the unrecognized tax benefits were included in long term income taxes payable and non current deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheet and have not been included in the table above 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued amendments to its existing standard for fair value measurement to achieve common guidance between us generally accepted accounting principles and international financial reporting standards 
in addition  the amended standard revises certain requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosure around fair value measurement 
it does not require additional fair value measurements and was not intended to establish valuation standards or affect valuation practices outside of financial reporting 
the updated standard is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of early adoption is not permitted 
the adoption of these amendments will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued an update to an existing standard for comprehensive income to make the presentation of items within other comprehensive income oci more prominent 
the updated standard prohibits the current presentation of oci in the statement of stockholders equity and instead  provides public companies the option of presenting oci in a continuous statement of comprehensive income or as two separate consecutive statements 
additionally  the update requires that reclassification adjustments be displayed on the face of the financial statements where oci is reported 
in december  the fasb issued another update that indefinitely deferred the specific requirement of presenting reclassification adjustments out of oci in both net income and oci on the face of the financial statements 
during the deferral period  the existing requirements for the presentation of reclassification adjustments must continue to be followed 
the updated standard is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of upon adoption  the updated standard will impact the presentation of our consolidated financial statements  however  it will have no impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued new accounting guidance intended to simplify goodwill impairment testing 
entities will be allowed to perform a qualitative assessment on goodwill impairment to determine whether a quantitative assessment is necessary 
this guidance is effective for goodwill impairment tests performed in interim and annual periods for fiscal years beginning after december  the standard is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued a new standard to address the disclosure requirements around offsetting financial and derivative instruments and their related arrangements to enable users of financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on a company s financial position 
the update requires companies to disclose both the net and gross amounts of the relevant assets and liabilities that are offset in the notes to the financial statements 
the updated standard is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of and will be applied retrospectively for all comparative periods presented 
we believe that the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk our operations include manufacturing and sales activities in the united states  canada and ireland as well as sales activities in countries outside the united states  including europe and asia pacific 
as a result  our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we distribute our products 
our operating results are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the us dollar and various foreign currencies  the most significant of which is the euro 
when the us dollar strengthens against these currencies  the relative value of sales made in the respective foreign currency decreases 
conversely  when the us dollar weakens against these currencies  the relative amounts of such sales increase 
overall  we are a net receiver of foreign currencies and  therefore  benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to those foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business 
a significant percentage of our product sales are denominated in foreign currencies 
we enter into foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts to partially mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on net cash flows from our foreign currency denominated sales 
we also hedge certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies  which reduces but does not eliminate our exposure to currency fluctuations between the date a transaction is recorded and the date that cash is collected or paid 
in general  the market risks of these contracts are offset by corresponding gains and losses on the transactions being hedged 
the following table summarizes the notional amounts  weighted average currency exchange rates and fair values of our open foreign currency exchange forward contracts at december  we had no foreign currency exchange option contracts outstanding at december  all contracts have maturities of months or less

table of contents interest rate risk our portfolio of available for sale marketable securities and our fixed and variable rate liabilities create an exposure to interest rate risk 
with respect to our investment portfolio  we adhere to an investment policy that requires us to limit amounts invested in securities based on credit rating  maturity  industry group and investment type and issuer  except for securities issued by the us government 
the goals of our investment policy  in order of priority  are as follows safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk  liquidity of investments sufficient to meet cash flow requirements  and competitive after tax rate of return

in connection with funding our billion acquisition of pharmasset  we liquidated approximately billion of our investment portfolio in late the proceeds of the sales were reinvested in money market funds which totaled billion as of december  as interest rate risk for money market funds is low  we have excluded the balance from the table of interest rate sensitive instruments above 
we continue to invest our existing portfolio in securities with a similar profile  however  the amounts invested are generally smaller and have a shorter investment horizon 
credit risk as of december   we held approximately million of auction rate securities within our available for sale long term marketable securities 
our auction rate securities comprised less than of our total 
table of contents cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december  in  we began observing the failed auctions for our auction rate securities for which the underlying assets are comprised of student loans 
most of our auction rate securities  including those subject to the failed auctions  are currently rated aaa  consistent with the high quality rating required by our investment policy  are supported by the federal government as part of the federal family education loan program and are over collateralized 
our auction rate securities reset every seven to days with maturity dates ranging from through and have annual interest rates ranging from to 
as of december   our auction rate securities continued to earn interest 
if auctions continue to fail for securities in which we have invested  we may be unable to liquidate some or all of our auction rate securities at par should we need or desire to access the funds invested in those securities 
however  based on our expected operating cash flows as well as access to funds through our credit facility  we believe that we will be able to hold these securities until there is a recovery in the auction market and the related securities  which may be at final maturity 
as a result  we do not anticipate that the current illiquidity of these auction rate securities will have a material effect on our cash requirements or working capital 
as of december   we held greek government issued bonds with an estimated fair value of approximately million within our available for sale long term marketable securities 
in  the greek government agreed to settle the majority of its aged outstanding accounts receivable with zero coupon bonds 
currently  these bonds trade infrequently on the open market at a substantial discount to the face value 
we believe we will be able to hold these securities until maturity 
as a result  we do not anticipate that the illiquidity of these securities will have a material effect on our cash requirements or working capital 
in light of the volatility and developments that we have seen in the financial markets  we continue to review our cash equivalents and marketable securities carefully and strive to invest prudently 
we believe that maintaining the primary goals of our investment policy  safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk  as well as liquidity  has helped protect us from many of the risks in the credit markets while allowing us to continue to meet our operating cash flow requirements as well as execute on other strategic opportunities 
we are also subject to credit risk from our accounts receivable related to our product sales 
our accounts receivable balance at december  was billion  compared to billion at december  the majority of our trade accounts receivable arises from product sales in the united states and europe 
as of december   our accounts receivables in southern europe  specifically greece  italy  portugal and spain totaled approximately billion  of which million were greater than days past due and million were greater than days past due
