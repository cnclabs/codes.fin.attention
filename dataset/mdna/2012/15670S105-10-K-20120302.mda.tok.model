item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  which we refer to as md a  of cenveo  inc and its subsidiaries  which we refer to as cenveo  should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k  which we refer to as the form k 
certain statements we make under this item constitute forward looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of see cautionary statements regarding forward looking statements in item and risk factors in item a 
introduction and executive overview we are one of the largest diversified printing companies in north america  according to the december printing impressions report 
we operate a global network of strategically located manufacturing facilities  serving a diverse base of over  customers 
the united states printing industry is highly fragmented  with a broad range of sectors  including commercial printing and envelope converting and labels manufacturing  among others 
we believe the printing industry has excess capacity and will continue to be highly competitive 
our business strategy has been and continues to be focused on pursuing strategic acquisitions  improving our cost structure  providing a diverse quality product offering portfolio to our customers and maintaining reasonable levels of financial flexibility 
we believe this strategy has allowed us to diversify our revenue base  maintain our low cost producer focus and deliver quality product offerings to our customers 
we continue to selectively review acquisition opportunities that will allow us to grow in niche markets  broaden our product offerings and increase our economies of scale 
our acquisition strategy is focused on product expansion into highly complimentary niche businesses or expanding our presence in the current markets in which we operate today 
over the past six years we have completed fourteen acquisitions that either provided us entry into new highly complementary print related markets or expanded our existing print or envelope manufacturing platform 
we believe our focused approach to acquisitions should allow us to grow at a faster pace than the broader commercial printing industry 
we intend to continue practicing our acquisition disciplines and pursuing opportunities that allow for greater expected profitability and cash flows or improved operating efficiencies 
we believe that our manufacturing platform  strategically located facilities and our industry experienced management team enables us to continuously seek improvements to our operating margins 
we continue to pursue cost savings measures in an effort to align our cost structure with our anticipated revenues and mitigate the impact of pricing pressures 
we work closely with our vendors with a focus on supply chain enhancements that lower our input costs and improve our operating margins 
our acquisitions along with our cost savings and restructuring plans have allowed us to mitigate the need for significant capital expenditures by realigning our most efficient equipment throughout our manufacturing platform while maintaining a reasonable level of financial flexibility during the extended economic uncertainty 
our continued approach to review our cost structure could require additional plant closures  consolidations and employee headcount reductions throughout our operating platform 
our broad portfolio of products includes envelope converting  commercial printing  labels manufacturing  content management and specialty packaging 
many of our customers focus on price as a key decision driver 
we believe that given the extended economic uncertainty  our customers will continue to focus on price 
in addition  certain of our key customers have recently provided us the opportunity to become a single source supplier for all of their printed product needs 
this trend benefits our customers as they seek to leverage their buying power and helps us improve operating efficiencies in our plants with increased throughput in multiple product lines via a single customer relationship 
our financial flexibility depends heavily on our ability to maintain relationships with existing customers  attract new financially viable customers and maximize our operating profits  all of which are vital to our ability to service our current debt level 
our level of indebtedness  which requires significant principal and interest payments  could potentially impact our ability to reinvest cash flows from operations into our business via capital expenditures or niche acquisitions 
we therefore closely monitor working capital  including the credit we extend to and the collections we receive from customers as well as inventory levels and vendor pricing  while continuously seeking out pricing and manufacturing improvements to increase our cash flow 
see part item of this form k for a more complete description of our business 
outlook we believe that the mild recovery we experienced in from the economic downturn will continue in we believe our efforts to reduce our operating cost structure  which we began implementing at the beginning of the economic downturn  allowed us to mitigate significant impacts to our operating performance and to our business over the past three years 
the envelope and print industries are highly competitive and significantly fragmented 
we believe these factors combined with a slow general economic recovery will continue to impact our results of operations due to open capacity and pricing pressures 
during  we plan to continue our focus on reducing our debt leverage levels 
during the third quarter of  we began a plan to reduce our debt leverage levels to targeted levels through this plan will require us to continue to focus on all significant cash inflows and outflows throughout our desired timeline while also focusing on reducing our cash conversion cycle and improving our cash flows from operations by enhancing our inventory management and billing and collection processes 
we believe that we can achieve significant cash flow from operations improvements as we implement this plan over our targeted timeline 
as a result of this plan and our production process during the back half of  we reduced our consolidated inventories in excess of million 
we believe that we will be able to continue to reduce our inventories to desired levels throughout as well 
in addition  we believe that certain enhancements we have made and are considering making to our billing and collection process will further increase our cash flows from operations throughout during  we plan to complete our integration of epg into our manufacturing platform 
we expect that this acquisition will allow us to gain incremental manufacturing efficiencies from the manufacturing equipment we acquired with the acquisition as well as the geographic overlap of facilities 
in december  our senior subordinated notes due  which we refer to as notes  are due 
in  we will continue to monitor the high yield bond market to evaluate the best time to refinance the notes 
we may also consider refinancing our other bond indentures should we elect to enter the bond market for a refinancing opportunity on the notes 
in the meantime  on october   we completed an amendment  which we refer to as the amendment  of our million revolving credit facility due  which we refer to as our revolving credit facility and a million term loan due  which we refer to as the term loan b  which collectively with the revolving credit facility we refer to as the credit facilities 
the amendment allows us to repurchase up to million of our outstanding notes  subject to a maximum leverage ratio and the satisfaction of certain other conditions 
furthermore  in february of  we amended our credit facility  to increase our restricted dispositions basket in order to divest our documents and forms business  which we refer to as the amendment 
the amendment required that of net proceeds be used to repay our term loan b and requires that the remaining amount be used to reinvest in the business 
further  the amendment allows us to repay junior debt in an amount equal to of the net proceeds 
we will continue to repurchase these bonds in the open market or privately negotiated transactions 
such repurchases  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
since the and amendments  we have repurchased million of our notes  million of our senior subordinated notes  due  which we refer to as notes and million of the senior unsecured notes due  which we refer to as the notes  and retired them for million  million and million  respectively 
additionally  we repaid million of the term loan b in connection with the amendment 
acquisitions in august of  we completed the acquisition of nesbitt 
nesbitt is a niche content management business that focuses on high end book content development and project management offerings and was acquired to further enhance our content management operations 
additionally  we expect that nesbitt will enable us to provide additional cross selling opportunities to our existing customer base 
we believe that the integration efforts related to nesbitt are minimal and we expect to be completed with those efforts in early in february of  we acquired the assets of epg 
epg manufactures and distributes envelope products for the billing  financial  direct mail and office products markets 
we believe epg will further strengthen our existing envelope operations and will provide for manufacturing efficiencies given epg s unique asset base and geographic overlap of facilities that exists between epg and our existing envelope operations 
during  we completed the closure and consolidation of three epg plants into our existing operations and reduced headcount for duplicative functions 
we recently completed a significant milestone in the integration of epg into our existing information technology infrastructure and operational and financial systems and terminated our transition services arrangement 
epg is no longer on their legacy infrastructure or operational and financial systems 
as a result  we have improved our visibility to work being performed within our legacy envelope and epg manufacturing platforms  which provides us with the opportunity to produce work more profitably and with increased customer satisfaction 
further  we believe the integration of epg will continue to occur into and may include additional plant closures and consolidations as well as additional headcount reductions for duplicative functions 
in november of  we completed the acquisition of gilbreth 
gilbreth utilizes specialized printing technologies as a manufacturer and marketer of full body shrink sleeves and tamper evident neck bands 
we believe the acquisition of gilbreth will allow us to internally produce product that we historically had to purchase from an outsourced partner 
additionally  we expect that gilbreth will enable us to provide additional cross selling opportunities to our existing customer base 
we have completed our integration efforts related to gilbreth 
in may of  we completed the acquisition of glyph  which we believe will enhance our content management operations 
we completed our integration of glyph in in february of  we completed the acquisition of clixx 
clixx has provided our canadian print operations with end of production capabilities that were previously unavailable to those operations 
collectively  we refer to nesbitt and epg as the acquisitions and gilbreth  glyph and clixx as the acquisitions 
discontinued operations in  we began exploring our opportunities to divest certain non strategic or underperforming businesses within our manufacturing platform 
as a result  in the fourth quarter of  the financial results of our documents and forms business as well as our wide format papers business have been accounted for as discontinued operations  which we refer to collectively as the discontinued operations  resulting in our historical consolidated balance sheets  statement of operations and statement of cash flows being reclassified to reflect these discontinued operations separately from our continuing operations 
in january of  we completed the sale of our wide format papers business and received proceeds of million 
in february of  we completed the sale of our documents and forms business and received proceeds of million  which excludes an additional million that is being held in escrow for a period of time subject to terms of the sale agreement 
goodwill and intangible asset impairments in the fourth quarter of  we recorded allocated non cash goodwill impairment charges of million related to the discontinued operations 
these charges were due to our carrying value of the assets  including allocated goodwill and intangible assets  of the discontinued operations being in excess of the fair value we received from divesting these businesses 
during the third quarter of  given the continued economic uncertainty that remained in the united states and global economies and revisions to our forecasted operating results  primarily in our publisher services group  which is part of the commercial printing segment and which we refer to as our psg reporting unit  we believed that there were sufficient indicators that would require us to perform an interim goodwill and long lived asset impairment analysis as of october  as a result of our goodwill and long lived asset impairment analysis  we recorded non cash impairment charges of million related to goodwill and million related to other long lived assets  of which million related to an indefinite lived tradename and million related to customer relationships within our psg reporting unit 
we believe that these charges primarily resulted from reductions in the estimated fair value of this reporting unit due to i higher discount rates applied to lower estimated future cash flows as compared to our prior year analysis and ii continued economic uncertainty  which has increased customer cost awareness resulting in continued price pressures  lower page counts  and a shift from historical web and sheet fed print products to lower cost digital print products 
consolidated operating results this md a includes an overview of our consolidated results of operations for  and followed by a discussion of the results of each of our reportable segments for the same period 
our results of operations for the year ended include the operating results of the acquisitions  subsequent to their respective acquisition dates 
our results of operations for the year ended include the operating results of the acquisitions  subsequent to their respective acquisition dates 
our results of operations for the year ended include the operating results of nashua subsequent to its acquisition date of september  a summary of our consolidated statement of operations is presented below 
the summary presents reported net sales and operating income loss 
see segment operations below for a summary of net sales and operating income loss of our operating segments that we use internally to assess our operating performance 
our reporting periods for  and each consisted of week periods  respectively  ending on the saturday closest to the last day of the calendar month and ended on december   january  and january   respectively 
we refer to such periods herein as i the year ended  ii the year ended  and iii the year ended all references to years and year ends herein relate to fiscal years rather than calendar years

the increased sales for our envelopes and labels segment primarily resulted from the integration of epg into our operations  as epg was not included in our operations during the increase in sales within our commercial printing segment was due to i our acquisitions of gilbreth  glyph and clixx  as they were not included in our operations for a full year in  and ii the integration of nesbitt into our operations  as nesbitt was not included in our operations for these increases were offset by volume declines and changes in product mix 
see segment operations below for a more detailed discussion of the primary factors for the changes in net sales by reportable segment 
net sales for increased million  as compared to  due to increased sales from our envelopes and labels segment of million  offset by lower sales from our commercial printing segment of million 
the increased sales for our envelopes and labels segment primarily resulted from the integration of nashua into our operations  as nashua was not included in our results for a full year during the decrease in sales within our commercial printing segment was due to volume declines  changes in product mix and lower material costs  primarily due to the extended economic uncertainty that we experienced during  and lost sales resulting from plant closures as part of our restructuring plans 
these decreases to our commercial printing segment were partially offset by sales from the acquisitions  as the acquisitions were not included in our operations in see segment operations below for a more detailed discussion of the primary factors for the changes in net sales by reportable segment 
operating income operating income in  excluding the non cash goodwill and other long lived assets impairment charges of million in our commercial print segment  increased million  as compared to this increase was primarily due to higher operating income for our commercial printing segment of million and our envelopes and labels segment of million 
these increases were primarily due to an increase in gross margins from i the acquisitions  as they were not included in our operations for  ii the acquisitions  as they were not included in our operations for a full year in  and iii a decrease in restructuring and impairment charges resulting from cost savings initiatives taken to mitigate the general economic conditions

these increases were primarily due to an increase in gross margins from the acquisitions  as they were not included in our operations in  and a decrease in restructuring and impairment charges resulting from cost savings initiatives taken to mitigate the general economic conditions 
see segment operations below for a more detailed discussion of the primary factors for the changes in operating income by reportable segment 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased million to million in  from million in the decrease was primarily due to the redemption of higher cost interest rate swaps  partially offset by higher average outstanding debt balances primarily resulting from the epg acquisition 
interest expense in reflected average outstanding debt of approximately billion and a weighted average interest rate of  as compared to average outstanding debt of billion and a weighted average interest rate of in we expect interest expense in will be lower than largely due to the redemption of our higher cost interest rate swap agreements and our lower outstanding debt as a result of our debt reduction initiative 
however  if we are to refinance our notes and  if feasible  certain other debt indentures during  we may be subject to higher borrowing rates 
interest expense increased million to million in  from million in the increase was primarily due to higher interest rates resulting from i the april amendment  which we refer to as the amendment  to our revolving credit facility due  which we refer to as the revolving credit facility  and our term loans and delayed draw term loans due  which we refer to as the term loans  which collectively with the revolving credit facility we refer to as the amended credit facilities  and ii the february refinancing  which we refer to as the refinancing  that included an amendment to the amended credit facilities  and the issuance of million senior second lien notes due  which we refer to as the notes 
interest expense in reflected average outstanding debt of approximately billion and a weighted average interest rate of  compared to the average outstanding debt of approximately billion and a weighted average interest rate of in gain loss on early extinguishment of debt 
during  we repurchased million of our notes for million plus accrued and unpaid interest and million of our notes  for million plus accrued and unpaid interest 
as a result  we recognized gains on early extinguishment of debt of million 
during  in connection with our credit facility refinancing  in which we refinanced our amended credit facilities with the credit facilities  we incurred a loss on early extinguishment of debt of million of which million related to fees paid to consenting lenders and million related to the write off of previously unamortized debt issuance costs 
in connection with the refinancing  we incurred a loss on early extinguishment of debt of million of which million related to fees paid to consenting lenders and million related to the write off of previously unamortized debt issuance costs 
in  we recognized net gains on early extinguishment of debt of million  comprising of gains of million from the repurchase and retirement of principal amounts of million of our notes  million of our notes  and million of our notes 
these gains were partially offset by the loss on early extinguishment of debt related to the amendment of million  of which million related to fees paid to consenting lenders and million related to the write off of previously unamortized debt issuance costs 
income taxes years ended in thousands income tax expense benefit for us operations income tax expense benefit for foreign operations income tax expense benefit effective income tax rate in  we had an income tax expense of million  which primarily related to income tax on our domestic operations as well as taxes related to non deductible expenses mainly attributable to employee and stock compensation 
our effective tax rate during was higher than the federal statutory rate  primarily due to the non deductibility for income tax purposes of certain employee and stock related compensation  partially offset by a release of valuation allowance for a portion of our state income tax loss carryforwards 
we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will change significantly in the next twelve months 
we assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and  to the extent recoverability does not satisfy the more likely than not recognition criteria under asc  income taxes  record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
we consider all positive and negative evidence in evaluating our ability to realize our net deferred tax assets  including our operating results  ongoing tax planning  and forecast of future taxable income  on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
significant judgment is required with respect to the determination of whether or not a valuation allowance is required for certain of our deferred tax assets 
we considered the fact that we have reported a cumulative loss in recent years  which generally provides negative evidence regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets 
however  such cumulative losses mainly resulted from the goodwill impairment and restructuring related charges recorded over the last three years 
a substantial majority of the goodwill impairment charges had no impact on taxable income as these charges primarily are non deductible 
we performed an analysis of the recoverability of our net deferred tax assets as of december  deferred tax assets related to certain state net operating losses and foreign tax credit carryforwards did not reach the more likely than not realizability criteria and accordingly  were subject to a valuation allowance 
during  our valuation allowance was reduced by million  consisting of a reduction related to our state net operating loss carryforwards 
we analyzed the remaining net deferred tax assets using all positive and negative evidence to determine whether we met the more likely than not recognition criteria 
we believe that such remaining net deferred tax assets were more likely than not realizable based primarily on the weight of positive evidence provided by our tax planning strategies and projected future taxable income  including restructuring related charges and our historical results of operations excluding impairment charges related to non deductible goodwill 
however  in the circumstance that the financial projections are not achieved  our ability to realize these net deferred tax assets may be significantly impacted 
in  we had an income tax benefit of million  which primarily related to income tax benefits from our non cash impairment charges related to goodwill and other long lived assets and the reversal of liabilities for uncertain tax positions as well as taxes on our domestic operations 
our effective tax benefit rate during was lower than the federal statutory rate  primarily due to the non deductibility for income tax purposes of the non cash impairment charges related to goodwill and other long lived assets 
in  we had an income tax benefit of million  which primarily relates to the tax benefit on our domestic operations 
our effective tax benefit rate in was lower than the federal statutory rate  primarily due to non deductible expenses  offset in part by state tax benefits 
the non deductible expenses primarily relate to stock based compensation expense resulting from a difference in tax deductions available to us based on the market price of our stock based compensation at the time of exercise as compared to our recorded stock based compensation expense 
if we generated pre tax income  this would cause our effective income tax rate to be higher than our statutory federal rate 
income from discontinued operations  net of taxes 
discontinued operations represents the results of operations  including tax effects of our discontinued operations 
the results for include a non cash allocated goodwill impairment charge of million  which had no tax effect as it was non deductible goodwill 
there is no allocation of interest expense on our debt within our discontinued operations results 
income from discontinued operations for also includes the reduction of our liability for uncertain tax positions of million  net of deferred tax assets of million  as a result of the expiration of certain statute of limitations on uncertain tax positions related to the supremex income fund  which we refer to as the fund 
income from discontinued operations for primarily relates to the reduction of our liabilities for uncertain tax positions of million  net of deferred tax assets of million  as a result of the expiration of certain statute of limitations on uncertain tax positions related to the fund

envelopes and labels years ended in thousands segment net sales segment operating income operating income margin items included in segment operating income restructuring and impairment charges segment net sales segment net sales for our envelopes and labels segment increased million  or  in  as compared to this increase was primarily due to i sales generated from the integration of epg into our operations  including the impact of work transitioned from our existing operations to epg  as epg was not included in our results in  and ii higher sales of million from price and product mix changes primarily from our financial institution envelope customers increasing their demand for direct mail products  as opposed to generic envelope products  as well as our ability to pass along price increases to our envelope and short run labels customers  offset in part by product mix changes from our higher cost envelope office product offerings to our lower cost envelope office product offerings 
these increases were offset in part by lower sales volumes of approximately million  primarily from our long run labels business due to lost sales from a plant closure in and our decision to exit certain low margin envelope and labels businesses 
segment net sales for our envelopes and labels segment increased million  or  in  as compared to this increase was primarily due to i million of sales generated from the integration of nashua into our operations  including the impact of work transitioned from our existing operations to nashua  as nashua was not included in our results for a full year in  and ii higher sales volumes of approximately million due to increased unit volumes from our envelope customers  primarily our financial institution customers  offset in part by the loss of sales from three plant closures in and our decision to exit certain lower margin transactional business within our envelope operations 
these increases were offset in part by lower sales of million from price and product mix changes  primarily due to pricing pressures on our office products business as a result of the continued general economic conditions  which are being offset in part by our ability to pass along material price increases to our customers over time 
segment operating income segment operating income for our envelopes and labels segment increased million or in  as compared to this increase was primarily due to i increased gross margins of million primarily due to gross margins generated from epg  as epg was not included in our results in  and lower fixed costs resulting from three envelope plant closures in  and ii lower restructuring and impairment charges of million

these increases were substantially offset by lower sales volumes of million primarily due to i our specialty packaging operations due to our decision to exit certain low margin business  ii our digital business primarily due to lower customer demand  and iii our stm journal business due to continued declines in the circulation of journals and periodicals 
segment net sales for our commercial printing segment decreased million  or  in  as compared to this decrease was due to i lower sales volumes of million primarily due to the extended general economic uncertainty impacting our stm journals business  the closure of four commercial printing facilities during and two facilities in  and ii lower sales of million from price and product mix changes  primarily due to the extended general economic uncertainty 
these decreases were offset in part by i million of sales generated from the acquisitions  as they were not included in our operations for  and ii increased sales resulting from higher material costs being passed along to our customers 
segment operating income loss segment operating income for our commercial printing segment  excluding the non cash goodwill and other long lived assets impairment charges of million  increased million  or  in  as compared to this increase was primarily due to i increased gross margins of million primarily due to our lower cost structure as a result of cost savings initiatives taken in prior years and our acquisitions  as the acquisitions were not included in our results for the full year  ii lower restructuring and impairment charges  excluding the non cash goodwill and other long lived impairment charges of million  of million  iii lower selling  general and administrative expenses of million  resulting from our cost savings initiatives in prior years  offset in part by higher selling  general and administrative expenses from our acquisitions  as the acquisitions were not included in our results for the full year  and iv lower amortization expense of million

corporate expenses include the costs of running our corporate headquarters 
corporate expenses were higher in  as compared to  primarily due to higher compensation related expenses and lower vendor related discounts  offset in part by lower restructuring and impairment charges from our cost savings initiatives 
corporate expenses were lower in  as compared to  primarily due to lower stock based compensation and higher vendor related discounts  offset in part by higher restructuring and impairment charges from our cost savings initiatives 
restructuring  impairment and other charges 
in addition to the other restructuring plans implemented by our segments below  we currently have one active and five residual cost savings  restructuring and integration plans i the plan related to the integration of the epg acquisition  which we refer to as the epg plan and ii the plans related to the integration of the nashua corporation and glyph acquisitions  the cost savings and restructuring plan  the cost savings and integration plan and the cost savings and restructuring plan  which collectively we refer to as the residual plans 
upon the completion of the epg acquisition  we developed and implemented a plan to integrate epg into existing envelope operations 
since the date of acquisition  activities related to the epg plan have included the closure and consolidation of three manufacturing facilities into our existing operations and the elimination of duplicative headcount 
we anticipate that the integration of epg will continue into and may include additional closure or consolidation of manufacturing facilities and further headcount reductions 
in  our envelopes and labels and commercial printing segments have implemented further cost savings initiatives  which we refer to as other restructuring plans  in order to provide enhanced customer service  centralize various back office functions or rationalize our businesses 
these other restructuring plans also include the realignment of certain manufacturing platforms  which has resulted in the closure and consolidation of two commercial printing plants into our existing operations 
we believe that these initiatives were substantially complete at the end of as a result of actions taken during  including the epg plan  we reduced our headcount by approximately employees 
as of the year ended  our total restructuring liability was million  of which million is included in other current liabilities and million is included in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
our multi employer pension withdrawal liabilities are million of our remaining restructuring liabilities 
we believe these liabilities represent our best estimate of our withdrawal liabilities  however  we are exposed to significant risks and uncertainties arising from our participation in these multi employer pension plans 
while it is not possible to quantify the potential impact of our future actions or the future actions of other participating employers from the multi employer pension plans for which we have exited  our best estimate may be significantly impacted in the future due to lower future contributions or increased withdrawals from other participating employers 
during  we incurred million of restructuring and impairment charges  which included million of employee separation costs  asset impairments  net of million  equipment moving expenses of million  lease termination expenses of million  multi employer pension withdrawal expenses of million and building clean up and other expenses of million 
during  we incurred million of restructuring and impairment charges  which included million of employee separation costs  asset impairments  net of million  equipment moving expenses of million  lease termination expenses of million  multi employer pension withdrawal expenses of million and building clean up and other expenses of million

during  we incurred million of restructuring and impairment charges  which included million of employee separation costs  asset impairment charges  net of million  equipment moving expenses of million  lease termination expenses of million  pension withdrawal liability of million and building clean up and other expenses of million 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by continuing operating activities 
net cash provided by continuing operating activities was million in  which was primarily due to our net loss adjusted for non cash items of million and an increase in working capital of million  offset by pension and other post retirement plan contributions of million 
the increase in our working capital primarily resulted from i an increase in accounts payable due to the timing of vendor payments  and ii a decrease in our inventories primarily due to our inventory management initiative  which began in the third quarter of these increases were offset in part by i a decrease in other working capital changes primarily due to the timing of customer related payments and the timing of interest payments on our outstanding debt  and ii an increase in accounts receivables due to the timing of collections from and sales to our customers 
cash provided by continuing operating activities is generally sufficient to meet daily disbursement needs 
on days when our cash receipts exceed disbursements  we reduce our revolving credit balance or place excess funds in conservative  short term investments until there is an opportunity to pay down debt 
on days when our cash disbursements exceed cash receipts  we use our invested cash balance and or our revolving credit balance to fund the difference 
as a result  our daily revolving credit balance fluctuates depending on working capital needs 
the refinancing and notes issuance resulted in the elimination of nearly all of our revolving credit facility balances and thereby substantially increasing our liquidity position  which we may utilize for future acquisitions or debt repayments 
regardless  at all times we believe we have sufficient liquidity available to us to fund our cash needs 
net cash provided by continuing operating activities was million in  which was primarily due to our net loss adjusted for non cash items of million and a decrease in working capital of million 
the decrease in our working capital primarily resulted from a decrease in accounts payable due largely to the timing of payments to our vendors and an increase in inventory due to the timing of work performed for our customers  offset significantly by an increase in other working capital primarily due to the timing of interest payments on our long term debt and a decrease in receivables primarily due to the timing of collections from and sales to our customers 
net cash used in provided by discontinued operating activities 
represents the net cash used in provided by the discontinued operations operating activities 
net cash used in continuing investing activities 
net cash used in continuing investing activities was million in  primarily resulting from million of cash consideration for the acquisitions and capital expenditures of million  offset in part by million of proceeds from the sale of property  plant and equipment 
our debt agreements limit capital expenditures to million in plus any proceeds received from the sale of property  plant and equipment and  if certain conditions are satisfied  any unused permitted amounts from we estimate that we will spend approximately million on capital expenditures in  before considering proceeds from the sale of property  plant and equipment 
our primary sources for our capital expenditures are cash generated from operations  proceeds from the sale of property  plant and equipment  and financing capacity within our current debt arrangements 
these sources of funding are consistent with prior years funding of our capital expenditures

net cash used in discontinued investing activities 
represents the net cash used in discontinued operations related to capital expenditures 
net cash provided by used in financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities was million in  primarily due to i the repayment of million of our term loan b  ii open market purchases of our notes and notes of million and million  respectively  iii repayments of other long term debt of million  and iv fees paid to consenting lenders of million related to the amendment 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  primarily due to i cash proceeds from issuance of the notes  net of the original issuance discount  of million  and ii cash proceeds from issuance of the term loan b of million  net of original issuance discount  offset in part by i the repayment of term loans of million and million  net pay down of our revolving credit facility in connection with the refinancing  ii payment of fees and expenses of million in connection with the issuance of the notes  the refinancing and the credit facility refinancing  and iii repayments of other long term debt of million

the following table details our significant contractual obligations and other commitments as of december  in thousands payments due long term debt operating leases other total thereafter total includes million of estimated interest expense over the term of our long term debt  with variable rate debt having an average interest rate of approximately 
includes pension and other postretirement contributions of million  anticipated worker s compensation paid losses of million  restructuring related liabilities of million  including interest expense on lease terminations and multi employer pension withdrawal liabilities  and purchase commitments for equipment of million 
excluded from the table are million income tax contingencies as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount payable or timing of settlement 
long term debt 
our total outstanding long term debt  including current maturities  was approximately billion as of the year ended  a decrease of million from this decrease was primarily due to i cash flow from operations and ii proceeds from the sale of property  plant and equipment  partially offset by the acquisitions 
as of the year ended  approximately of outstanding debt was subject to fixed interest rates 
as of february   we had approximately million borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility 
on december   we entered into the credit facilities 
the proceeds of the credit facility refinancing were used to refinance our existing amended credit facilities 
the credit facilities extended the maturity of approximately one quarter of our total debt and enhanced our liquidity by extending the maturity of the revolving credit facility 
proceeds from the credit facilities together with available cash were used to repay the outstanding term loans  accrued interest thereon and to pay fees and expenses incurred related to the credit facilities 
the term loan b was issued at a discount of million  of which million remains unamortized as of the year ended borrowing rates under the credit facilities are selected at our option at the time of each borrowing and are generally based on the london interbank offered rate libor or the prime rate publicly announced by bank of america  na from time to time  in each case plus a specified interest rate margin 
with respect to the term loan b  libor based borrowings will not have an interest rate of less than per annum plus an applicable margin of per annum  and prime rate borrowings will not have an interest rate of less than per annum plus an applicable margin of per annum 
we also pay a commitment fee on unused revolving loan commitments of per annum 
all revolving loans mature on december   and the term loan b amortizes in quarterly installments equal to per year  commencing march   with the remaining principal balance due at maturity on december   in each case subject to certain conditions that could result in an earlier maturity 
the credit facilities contain certain restrictions that  among other things and with certain exceptions  limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness  prepay subordinated debt  transfer assets outside of cenveo  pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock 
the credit facilities also contain customary financial covenants  including a maximum consolidated leverage covenant  a maximum consolidated first lien leverage covenant and a minimum consolidated interest coverage covenant 
all three of these financial covenants were reset as a result of the credit facilities 
the consolidated leverage covenant threshold  with which we must be in pro forma compliance at all times  now requires us not to exceed at any time during fiscal year  then steps down in increments beginning in the second quarter of until it reaches during the third quarter of our fiscal year and remains at that level for the remainder of the term 
the consolidated first lien leverage covenant now requires us to not exceed through the second quarter of  then steps down to and remains at that level for the remainder of the term 
the consolidated interest coverage covenant now requires us to not be less than through the fourth quarter of  then steps up incrementally  reaching in and remains at that level for the remainder of the term 
the obligations under the credit facilities are guaranteed by us and each existing and future direct and indirect domestic subsidiary of cenveo 
the credit facilities are secured by a first priority perfected security interest in substantially all assets of cenveo and our domestic subsidiaries 
as the credit facilities have senior secured and first priority lien position in our capital structure and the most restrictive covenants  then provided we are in compliance with the credit facilities  we would also be in compliance  in most circumstances  with our debt incurrence tests within all of our debt indentures 
any default under the credit facilities would prevent us from borrowing additional amounts and could cause the indebtedness outstanding under the credit facilities and  by reason of cross acceleration or cross default provisions  all of the aforementioned notes and any other indebtedness we may then have  to become immediately due and payable 
credit facilities and debt compliance on october   we completed the amendment 
the amendment allows us to repurchase up to million of our outstanding notes  subject to a maximum leverage ratio and the satisfaction of certain other conditions 
we will continue to repurchase these notes in the open market  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
such repurchases  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other 
in connection with the amendment  we paid million to consenting lenders and related fees  which will be capitalized and amortized to interest expense  net over the remaining life of the credit facilities 
as of the year ended  we were in compliance with all debt agreement covenants 
we anticipate being in compliance with all debt agreement covenants through our fiscal year ended notes issuance on february   we issued our million notes that were sold with registration rights to qualified institutional buyers in accordance with rule a under the securities act of  and to certain non united states persons in accordance with regulation s under the securities act of the notes were issued at a discount of approximately million  of which approximately million and million remained unamortized as of the years ended and  respectively 
net proceeds after fees and expenses were used to pay down million of our term loans and million outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
subsequent events in the first quarter of  we purchased in the open market approximately million  million and million of our notes  notes and notes  respectively  and retired them for million  million and million  respectively  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
in connection with the retirement of these notes  notes and notes  we will record a gain on early extinguishment of debt of approximately million  which includes the write off of million of unamortized debt issuance costs in the first quarter of on february   we commenced a cash tender offer and consent solicitation for any and all of our outstanding notes  notes and notes at total consideration equal to  and  respectively  of outstanding principal plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon for the notes  notes and notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by march  this offer  in whole or in any of its parts  may be rescinded by us at any time prior to closing 
letters of credit as of the year ended  we had outstanding letters of credit of approximately million and a de minimis amount of surety bonds related to performance and payment guarantees 
based on our experience with these arrangements  we do not believe that any obligations that may arise will be significant 
credit ratings our current credit ratings are as follows rating agency corporate rating credit facilities notes notes notes notes outlook last update moody s b ba b caa caa caa negative july standard poor s b bb b ccc ccc ccc stable january in july  moody s investors services  which we refer to as moody s reaffirmed our corporate rating and the ratings on our credit facilities  notes  senior notes due  which we refer to as the notes  notes  and notes  in conjunction with the credit facility refinancing  and the detail of our current ratings have been provided in the table above 
in january  standard poor s ratings services  which we refer to as standard poor s  reaffirmed our corporate rating and the ratings on our credit facilities  notes  notes  notes and notes and the detail of our current ratings have been provided in the table above 
the terms of our existing debt do not have any rating triggers that impact our funding availability or influence our daily operations  including planned capital expenditures 
we do not believe that our current ratings will unduly influence our ability to raise additional capital if and or when needed 
some of our constituents closely track rating agency actions and would note any raising or lowering of our credit ratings  however  we believe that along with reviewing our credit ratings  additional quantitative and qualitative analysis must be performed to accurately judge our financial condition 
we expect that our internally generated cash flows and financing available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs through our fiscal year  however  this cannot be assured 
off balance sheet arrangements 
it is not our business practice to enter into off balance sheet arrangements 
accordingly  as of the years ended and  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting matters the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis based on historical experience and on various other factors which we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from estimates 
we believe that the following represent our more critical estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements allowance for losses on accounts receivable 
we maintain a valuation allowance based on the expected collectability of our accounts receivable  which requires a considerable amount of judgment in assessing the current creditworthiness of customers and related aging of past due balances 
as of the years ended and  the allowance provided for potentially uncollectible accounts receivable was million and million  respectively 
charges for bad debts recorded to the statement of operations were million in  million in and million in we cannot guarantee that our current credit losses will be consistent with those in the past 
these estimates may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have overstated or understated the allowance for losses required for uncollectible accounts receivable 
inventory valuation 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined on a first in  first out or average cost basis 
cost includes materials  labor and overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories 
if there were to be a significant decrease in demand for our products  we could be required to reduce our inventory balances accordingly 
provision for impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of specific assets or group of assets may not be recoverable 
when an evaluation is required  we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows associated with the specific asset or group of assets 
if the cost of the asset or group of assets cannot be recovered by these undiscounted cash flows  we would assess the fair value of the asset or asset group and if necessary  an impairment charge would be recorded 
our estimates of future cash flows are based on our experience and internal business plans 
our internal business plans require judgments regarding future economic conditions  product demand and pricing 
during  and  in connection with our restructuring and integration programs  we recorded non cash impairment charges  net on long lived assets of million  million and million  respectively 
our non cash impairment charges include a million non cash impairment charge related to customer relationships within our psg reporting unit  which is part of our commercial printing segment 
although we believe our estimates are appropriate  significant differences in the actual performance of an asset or group of assets may materially affect our evaluation of the recoverability of the asset values currently recorded 
additional impairment charges may be necessary in future years 
provision for impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
we evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets annually at the beginning of december and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred 
accounting standards codification asc  goodwill and other intangible assets  prescribes a two step method for determining goodwill impairment 
in the first step  we compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value  step two is completed to determine the amount of the impairment loss 
step two requires the allocation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets  including any unrecognized intangible assets  and liabilities in a hypothetical purchase price allocation 
any remaining unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill  which is compared to the corresponding carrying value of goodwill to compute the goodwill impairment amount 
as part of our impairment analysis for each reporting unit  we estimate the fair value of each unit  primarily using the income approach 
the income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit  including projected future operating results  economic projections  anticipated future cash flows  discount rates  and the allocation of shared service or corporate items 
the market approach was used as a test of reasonableness of the conclusions reached in the income approach 
the market approach estimates fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping 
the determination of the fair value of the reporting units and the allocation of that value to individual assets and liabilities within those reporting units requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions primarily include  but are not limited to the selection of appropriate peer group companies  control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which we compete  the discount rate  terminal growth rates  and forecasts of net sales  operating income  depreciation and amortization and capital expenditures 
the allocation requires several analyses to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities including  among others  trade names  customer relationships  and property  plant and equipment 
although we believe our estimates of fair value are reasonable  actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates 
changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting units  the amount of the goodwill impairment charge  or both 
we also compared the sum of the estimated fair values of the reporting units to our total enterprise value as implied by the market value of our equity securities 
this comparison indicated that  in total  our assumptions and estimates were not unreasonable 
however  future declines in the overall market value of our equity securities may indicate that the fair value of one or more reporting units has declined below their carrying value 
in  in connection with our discontinued operations  we allocated approximately million of our custom resale reporting unit goodwill to the discontinued operations based on a relative fair value allocation 
as a result of our relative fair value calculation for these businesses  we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million in discontinued operations  net of taxes on the consolidated statement of operations 
in  we recorded non cash goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment charges of million  of which million related to goodwill and related to an indefinite lived tradename in our psg reporting unit  which is part of our commercial printing segment 
in we did not record any goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment charges 
one measure of the sensitivity of the amount of goodwill impairment charges to key assumptions is the amount by which each reporting unit had fair value in excess of its carrying amount or had carrying amount in excess of fair value for the first step of the goodwill impairment test 
in  our four reporting units had fair value in excess of carrying value with fair value exceeding carrying value by at least 
generally  changes in estimates of expected future cash flows would have a similar effect on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
that is  a change in estimated future cash flows would decrease the estimated fair value of the reporting unit by approximately 
of the other key assumptions that impact the estimated fair values  most reporting units have the greatest sensitivity to changes in the estimated discount rate 
in  the discount rate for each reporting unit was estimated to be 
a basis point increase in our estimated discount rates would not have resulted in any additional reporting units failing step one 
determining whether an impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets has occurred requires an analysis of the fair value of each of the related tradenames 
however  if our estimates of the valuations of our tradenames prove to be inaccurate  an impairment charge could be necessary in future periods 
our annual impairment analysis for trade names utilizes a relief from royalty method in which the hypothetical benefits of owning each respective trade name are valued by discounting hypothetical royalty revenue over projected revenues covered by the trade names 
we utilized royalty rates of to for the use of the subject trade names based on comparable market rates  the profitability of the product employing the trade name  and qualitative factors  such as the strength of the name and years in usage 
we utilized a discount rate of  which was based on the weighted average cost of capital for the respective business plus a premium to account for the relative risks of the subject trade name 
in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations for all of our indefinite lived trade names  we applied hypothetical and decreases to the estimated fair value of our trade names 
such hypothetical decreases in fair value could be due to changes in discount rates and or assumed royalty rates 
these hypothetical and decreases in estimated fair value would not have resulted in an impairment of any of our identifiable indefinite lived trade names 
self insurance reserves 
we are self insured for the majority of our workers compensation costs and health insurance costs  subject to specific retention levels 
we rely on claims experience and the advice of consulting actuaries and administrators in determining an adequate liability for self insurance claims 
while we believe that the estimates of our self insurance liabilities are reasonable  significant differences in our experience or a significant change in any of our assumptions could materially affect the amount of workers compensation and healthcare expenses we record on an annual basis 
our self insurance workers compensation liability is estimated based on reserves for claims that are established by a third party administrator 
the estimate of these reserves is adjusted from time to time to reflect the estimated future development of the claims 
our liability for workers compensation claims is the estimated total cost of the claims on a fully developed and discounted basis that considers anticipated payment patterns 
as of the years ended and  the undiscounted liability was million and million  respectively  and the discounted liability was million and million  respectively  using a discount rate 
our self insured healthcare liability represents our estimate of claims that have been incurred  but not reported as of the years ended and we rely on claims experience and the advice of consulting actuaries to determine an adequate liability for self insured plans 
this liability was million and million as of the years ended and  respectively  and was estimated based on an analysis of actuarial completion factors that estimated incurred but unreported liabilities derived from the historical claims experience 
the estimate of our liability for employee healthcare represents between and days of unreported claims 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  product delivery has occurred  pricing is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
since a significant portion of our products are customer specific  it is common for our customers to inspect the quality of the product at our facilities prior to shipment 
products shipped are not subject to contractual right of return provisions 
we record sales net of applicable sales tax and freight costs that are included in the price of the product are included in net sales while the costs of delivering finished goods to customers are recorded as freight costs and included in cost of sales 
accounting for income taxes 
we are required to estimate our income taxes in each jurisdiction in which we operate  which primarily includes the united states  canada and india 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
the tax effects of these temporary differences are recorded as deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax return in future years for which we have already recorded an expense in our consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax items that have been deducted for tax purposes  but have not yet been recorded as an expense in our consolidated financial statements 
as of the years ended and  we had net deferred tax assets of million and million  respectively  from our united states operations 
the change in united states net deferred taxes is primarily due to an increase in our accrued pension and postretirement liabilities that can be used to offset taxable income in future years when cash contributions are made into our plans 
as of the years ended and  we had foreign net deferred tax liabilities of million and million  respectively 
we assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and  to the extent recoverability does not satisfy the more likely than not recognition criteria under asc  income taxes  record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
we consider all positive and negative evidence in evaluating our ability to realize our net deferred tax assets  including our operating results  ongoing tax planning  and forecast of future taxable income  on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
significant judgment is required with respect to the determination of whether or not a valuation allowance is required for certain of our deferred tax assets 
we considered the fact that we have reported a cumulative loss in recent years  which generally provides negative evidence regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets 
however  such cumulative losses mainly resulted from the goodwill impairment and restructuring related charges recorded over the last three years 
a substantial majority of the goodwill impairment charges had no impact on taxable income as these charges primarily are non deductible 
we performed an analysis of the recoverability of our net deferred tax assets as of december  deferred tax assets related to certain state net operating losses and foreign tax credit carryforwards did not reach the more likely than not realizability criteria and accordingly  were subject to a valuation allowance 
during  our valuation allowance was reduced by million  consisting of a reduction related to our state net operating loss carryforwards 
we analyzed the remaining net deferred tax assets using all positive and negative evidence to determine whether we met the more likely than not recognition criteria 
we believe that such remaining net deferred tax assets were more likely than not realizable based primarily on the weight of positive evidence provided by our tax planning strategies and projected future taxable income  including restructuring related charges and our historical results of operations excluding impairment charges related to non deductible goodwill 
however  in the circumstance that the financial projections are not achieved  our ability to realize these net deferred tax assets may be significantly impacted 
we recognize a tax position in our consolidated financial statements when it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities 
this recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable  the final outcome of uncertain tax positions may be materially different from that which is reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
we adjust such reserves upon changes in circumstances that would cause a change to the estimate of the ultimate liability  upon effective settlement or upon the expiration of the statute of limitations  in the period in which such event occurs 
during  we did not reduce our liabilities for uncertain tax positions 
during  we reduced our liabilities for uncertain tax positions by million as a result of the expiration of certain statutes of limitations 
pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
we record annual amounts relating to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans based on calculations which include various actuarial assumptions including discount rates  anticipated rates of return  compensation increases and current expected mortality rates 
we review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is appropriate to do so 
the effects of modifications are recognized immediately on our consolidated balance sheet  but are generally amortized into our consolidated statement of operations over future periods  with the deferred amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
we believe that the assumptions utilized in recording our obligations under our plans are reasonable based on our experience  market conditions and input from our actuaries and investment advisers 
we determine our assumption for the discount rate to be used for purposes of computing annual service and interest costs based on the citigroup pension liability index as of our respective year end dates 
the weighted average discount rate for pension and other postretirement benefits was and for the years ended and  respectively 
a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate at year end would increase the pension and other postretirement plans projected benefit obligation by approximately million 
a one percentage point increase in the discount rate at the year ended would decrease the pension and other postretirement plans projected benefit obligation by approximately million 
our investment objective is to maximize the long term return on the pension plan assets within prudent levels of risk 
investments are primarily diversified with a blend of equity securities  fixed income securities and alternative investments 
equity investments are diversified by including united states and non united states stocks  growth stocks  value stocks and stocks of large and small companies 
fixed income securities are primarily united states governmental and corporate bonds  including mutual funds 
alternative investments are primarily private equity hedge funds and hedge fund of funds 
we consult with our financial advisers on a regular basis regarding our investment objectives and asset performance 
new accounting pronouncements we are required to adopt certain new accounting pronouncements 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
commitments and contingencies our business and operations are subject to a number of significant risks  the most of which are summarized in item a risk factors and in note to our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks such as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates  which may adversely affect results of operations and financial position 
risks from interest rate fluctuations and changes in foreign currency exchange rates are managed through normal operating and financing activities 
as of the year ended  we had no interest rate swap agreements outstanding 
as of the year ended  we had million of interest rate swaps 
our hedges of interest rate risk were designated and documented at inception as cash flow hedges and were evaluated for effectiveness at least quarterly 
as of the year ended  we had variable rate debt outstanding of million 
in addition  our term loan b is subject to a london interbank offered rate  which we refer to as libor  floor of 
as such  a change of to current libor rates would not have a significant impact to our interest expense 
our changes in foreign currency exchange rates are managed through normal operating and financing activities 
we have foreign operations  primarily in canada and india  and thus are exposed to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
for the year ended  a uniform strengthening of the united states dollar relative to the local currency of our foreign operations would have resulted in a decrease in sales and operating income of approximately million and million  respectively 
the effects of foreign currency exchange rates on future results would also be impacted by changes in sales levels or local currency prices
