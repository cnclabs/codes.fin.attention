item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview ducommun incorporated ducommun or the company  through its subsidiaries  provides engineering and manufacturing services primarily to the aerospace and defense industry through a wide spectrum of electronics and structural applications 
we design  engineer and manufacture mission critical aerostructure and critical electronics and electromechanical components and subassemblies 
we also provide engineering  technical and program management services 
our products and services are used on domestic and foreign commercial and military aircraft  helicopter  missile and space programs  as well as in certain industrial  natural resources  medical and other commercial markets 
we operate through two primary business units dlt and das 
a summary of highlights for the year ended december  includes net sales increased in versus  reflecting increased sales of  from the labarge  inc acquisition diluted loss per share in was  resulting from a non cash goodwill impairment charge and merger related expenses including cost of sales relating to the write up of labarge inventory 
excluding the goodwill impairment charge and the merger related expenses of and per fully diluted share  respectively  diluted earnings per share was cash used in operating activities was  in excluding merger related expenses cash flow from operating activities was firm backlog at the end of was approximately  on june   the company completed the acquisition of all the outstanding stock of labarge  inc labarge  formerly a publicly owned company based in st 
louis  missouri for  net of cash acquired and excluding acquisition costs 
labarge had significant sales to customers in the aerospace  defense  natural resources  industrial  medical and other commercial markets 
the company provided its customers with sophisticated electronic  electromechanical and mechanical products through contract design and manufacturing services 
the operating results for the acquisition have been included in the consolidated statements of operations since the date of the acquisition 
for the twelve months ended december   operating expenses included expenses related to the acquisition of labarge of  and interest expense included the write off of  of unamortized financing costs  as a result of the company s debt refinancing related to the acquisition of labarge 
in connection with the acquisition of labarge on june   the company borrowed  under a senior secured term loan and entered into a senior secured revolving credit facility of  both the term loan and the credit facility provide the option of choosing the libor rate with a libor rate floor of plus  or the alternate base rate with 
table of contents an alternate base rate floor of plus 
the alternate base rate is the greater of the a prime rate and b federal funds rate plus 
the term loan requires quarterly principal payments of  beginning on september  and mandatory prepayment of certain amounts of excess cash flow on an annual basis beginning in principal payments of  were paid in september and december the revolving credit facility matures on june  and the term loan matures on june  the revolving credit facility and term loan contain minimum earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda and maximum leverage ratio covenants under certain circumstances  as well as limitations on future disposition of property  capital expenditures  investments  acquisitions  repurchase of stock  dividends  and outside indebtedness 
in connection with the acquisition of labarge  the company also issued  of senior unsecured notes with interest of per annum  payable semi annually on january and july of each year  beginning in and ending  at which time the entire principal amount is due 
the first interest payment was made in january the company believes the labarge acquisition will allow us to expand our presence significantly in the aerospace and defense markets  as well as diversify our sales base across new markets  including industrial  natural resources  medical and other commercial end markets 
more specifically  the company expects to realize the following benefits from the labarge acquisition strengthen our market position as a significant tier supplier for both structural and electronic assemblies diversify our end markets expand our platforms work content on existing programs and capabilities on new and existing programs increase value added manufacturing services content in our product portfolio expand our technology product portfolio realize potential synergies 
for the twelve months ended december   we generated sales of  and recorded a net loss of  which included an after tax goodwill impairment charge of  ebitda and adjusted ebitda for the twelve months ended december  were  and  respectively 
see below for certain information regarding ebitda and adjusted ebitda  including reconciliations of ebitda and adjusted ebitda to net income 
we view ebitda and adjusted ebitda as important operating performance measures that serve as a basis for measuring business segment operating performance 
we use ebitda and adjusted ebitda internally as complementary financial measures to evaluate the performance of our businesses and  when viewed with our gaap financial results and accompanying reconciliations  we believe they provide additional useful information to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our businesses 
we have 
table of contents expanded our operations significantly through the recent labarge acquisition 
as a result  our operating income has included significant charges for amortization and merger related transaction and change in control compensation expenses 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda exclude these charges and provide meaningful information about the operating performance of our businesses apart from the amortization and merger related transactions and change in control compensation expenses  as well as interest and tax expenses 
non gaap financial measures to supplement financial information presented in accordance with gaap  we use additional measures to clarify and enhance the understanding of our respective past performance and future prospects such as ebitda and adjusted ebitda and the related financial ratios 
we define these measures  explain how they are calculated and provide reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable gaap measure in the tables below 
ebitda  adjusted ebitda and the related financial ratios  as presented in this form k  are supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by  or presented in accordance with  gaap 
they are not a measurement of our financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as alternatives to net income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with gaap  or as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities as measures of our liquidity 
we present ebitda  adjusted ebitda and the related financial ratios  as applicable  because we believe that measures such as these provide useful information with respect to our ability to meet our future debt service  capital expenditures  working capital requirements and overall operating performance 
in addition  we utilize ebitda and adjusted ebitda when interpreting operating trends and results of operations of our respective businesses 
the presentation of these measures should not be interpreted to mean that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda have limitations as analytical tools  and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
some of these limitations are they do not reflect our cash expenditures  future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments they do not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs they do not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future  and ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements they are not adjusted for all non cash income or expense items that are reflected in our statements of cash flows they do not reflect the impact on earnings of charges resulting from matters unrelated to our ongoing operations  and other companies in our industry may calculate ebitda and adjusted ebitda differently from us  limiting their usefulness as comparative measures 

table of contents because of these limitations  ebitda  adjusted ebitda and the related financial ratios should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as a measure of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations 
you should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap results and using ebitda and adjusted ebitda only supplementally 
see our consolidated financial statements contained in this form k report 
however  the company believes that ebitda and adjusted ebitda are useful to an investor in evaluating our results of operations because these measures are widely used by investors to measure a company s operating performance without regard to items excluded from the calculation of such terms  which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets  capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired  among other factors help investors to evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the effect of our capital structure from our operating performance  and are used by our management team for various other purposes in presentations to our board of directors as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting 
the following financial items have been added back to our net income when calculating ebitda and adjusted ebitda amortization expense may be useful to investors because it represents the estimated attrition of our acquired customer base and the diminishing value of product rights depreciation may be useful to investors because it generally represents the wear and tear on our property and equipment used in our operations merger related expenses  including change in control compensation  may be useful to investors for determining current cash flow interest expense may be useful to investors for determining current cash flow income tax expense may be useful to investors because it represents the taxes which may be payable for the period and the change in deferred taxes during the period  and may reduce cash flow available for use in our business 
management uses non gaap measures only to supplement our gaap results and to provide additional information that is useful to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business 

table of contents the following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income to ebitda and adjusted ebitda 
in thousands net loss income depreciation and amortization interest expense  net income tax provision benefit ebitda merger related transaction expenses merger related change in control compensation expenses adjusted ebitda includes amortization of intangibles and additional depreciation expense related to the labarge acquisition and prior acquisitions 
includes deferred financing costs in connection with the labarge acquisition 
includes investment banking  accounting  legal  tax and valuation expenses as a direct result of the labarge acquisition 
merger related transaction cost resulting from a change in control provision for certain labarge key executives and employees arising in connection with the labarge acquisition 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and that require the use of subjective estimates based upon past experience and management s judgment 
because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ from these estimates 
below are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions 
for additional accounting policies  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition except as described below  the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  collection is reasonably assured and delivery of products has occurred or services have been rendered 
revenue from products sold under long term contracts is recognized by the company on the same basis as other sale transactions 
the company has a significant number of contracts for which net sales are accounted for under the percentage of completion method using the units of delivery as the measure of completion 
the percentage of completion method requires the use of assumptions and estimates related to the contract value  the total cost at completion  and measurement of progress towards completion 
these contracts are primarily fixed price contracts that vary widely in terms of size  length of performance period and expected gross profit margins 
the company also recognizes revenue on the sale of services including prototype products based on the type of contract time and materials  cost plus reimbursement and firm fixed price 
revenue is recognized by i on time and materials contracts as time is spent at hourly rates  which are 
table of contents negotiated with customers  plus the cost of any allowable materials and out of pocket expenses  ii on cost plus reimbursement contracts based on direct and indirect costs incurred plus a negotiated profit calculated as a percentage of cost  a fixed amount or a performance based award fee  and iii on fixed price contracts on the percentage of completion method measured by the percentage of costs incurred to estimated total costs 
provision for estimated losses on contracts the company records provisions for estimated losses on contracts considering total estimated costs to complete the contract compared to total anticipated revenues in the period in which such losses are identified 
the provisions for estimated losses on contracts require management to make certain estimates and assumptions  including those with respect to the future revenue under a contract and the future cost to complete the contract 
management s estimate of the future cost to complete a contract may include assumptions as to improvements in manufacturing efficiency and reductions in operating and material costs 
if any of these or other assumptions and estimates do not materialize in the future  the company may be required to record additional provisions for estimated losses on contracts 
goodwill the company s business acquisitions have resulted in goodwill 
goodwill is not amortized but is subject to impairment tests on an annual basis in the fourth quarter and between annual tests  in certain circumstances  when events indicate an impairment may have occurred 
goodwill is tested for impairment utilizing a two step method 
in the first step  the company determines the fair value of the reporting unit using expected future discounted cash flows and market valuation approaches comparable company revenue and ebitda multiples  requiring management to make estimates and assumptions about the reporting unit s future prospects 
if the net book value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  the company then performs the second step of the impairment test which requires fair valuation of all the reporting unit s assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  with any residual fair value being allocated to goodwill 
this residual fair value of goodwill is then compared to the carrying amount to determine impairment 
an impairment charge will be recognized only when the estimated fair value of a reporting unit  including goodwill  is less than its carrying amount 
the company performed its annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter 
as of the most recent annual impairment test step one on december   the fair value of the das and miltec reporting units exceeded their carrying values by and  respectively 
however  the fair value of the dlt reporting unit was less than its carrying value by 
as a result  the second step step two of the impairment test was required for the dlt reporting unit 
the tangible and intangible assets were revalued according to asc and a pre tax impairment of goodwill of million was recorded 
the impairment was driven by a decline in the company s market value as of december   following the labarge acquisition and a softening defense market 
as of december   the das  dlt  and miltec reporting units had million  million  and million of recorded goodwill  respectively 

table of contents other intangible assets the company amortizes purchased other intangible assets with finite lives over the estimated economic lives of the assets  ranging from one to fourteen years generally using the straight line method 
the value of other intangibles acquired through business combinations has been estimated using present value techniques which involve estimates of future cash flows 
actual results could vary  potentially resulting in impairment charges 
accounting for stock based compensation the company uses a black scholes valuation model in determining the stock based compensation expense for options  net of an estimated forfeiture rate  on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
the company has one award population with an option vesting term of four years 
the company estimated the forfeiture rate based on its historic experience 
for performance and restricted stock units  the company calculates compensation expense  net of an estimated forfeiture rate  on a straight line basis over the requisite service performance period of the awards 
the performance stock units vest based on a three year cumulative performance cycle 
the restricted stock units  vest over various periods of time ranging from one to five years 
the company estimates the forfeiture rate based on its historic experience 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on a first in  first out basis 
inventoried costs include raw materials  outside processing  direct labor and allocated overhead  adjusted for any abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage incurred  but do not include any selling  general and administrative expense 
costs under long term contracts are accumulated into  and removed from  inventory on the same basis as other contracts 
the company assesses the inventory carrying value and reduces it  if necessary  to its net realizable value based on customer orders on hand  and internal demand forecasts using management s best estimates given information currently available 
the company s customer demand can fluctuate significantly caused by factors beyond the control of the company 
the company maintains an allowance for potentially excess and obsolete inventories and inventories that are carried at costs that are higher than their estimated net realizable values 
if market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  such as an unanticipated decline in demand and not meeting expectations  inventory write downs may be required 

table of contents environmental liabilities environmental liabilities are recorded when environmental assessments and or remedial efforts are probable and costs can be reasonably estimated 
generally  the timing of these accruals coincides with the completion of a feasibility study or the company s commitment to a formal plan of action 
further  the company reviews and updates its environmental accruals as circumstances change and or additional information is obtained that reasonably could be expected to have a meaningful effect on the outcome of a matter or the estimated cost thereof

the charge in reduced goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition of miltec 
the principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are the projected results of operations  weighted average cost of capital wacc  and terminal value assumptions 
the wacc takes into account the relative weights of each component of the company s consolidated capital structure equity and debt and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted as appropriate to consider risk profiles associated with growth projection risks 
the terminal value assumptions are applied to the final year of discounted cash flow model 
due to many variables inherent in the estimation of a business s fair value and the relative size of the company s recorded goodwill  differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of the company s impairment analysis
