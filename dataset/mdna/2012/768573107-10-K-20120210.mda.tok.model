overview we were founded in may by experienced industry leaders with a vision to improve the performance of wide area distributed computing 
we began commercial shipments of our steelhead products in may and have since sold our products to over  customers worldwide 
we offer several product lines including steelhead appliances directed at the wan optimization market  cascade products in the network performance management market  our stingray product line which competes in the virtual application delivery controller market  and our whitewater cloud storage gateway directed at the cloud back up and disaster recovery solution market 
we are headquartered in san francisco  california 
our personnel are located throughout the us and in approximately thirty countries worldwide 
we expect to continue to add personnel in the us and internationally to provide additional geographic sales  research and development  general and administrative and technical support coverage 
the riverbed strategy our goal is to establish our solutions as the preeminent performance and efficiency standard for organizations relying on wide area distributed computing 
key elements of our strategy include build a unified performance platform riverbed is the performance company 
our vision is to give customers the tools to create the highest performing it environment possible  enabling users everywhere to be more productive while giving it teams greater control over their enterprises technology resources 
our vision focuses on the intersection of applications  networks  and storage  and brings customers a single  unified view of performance in their distributed environment  maintain and extend our technological advantages we believe that we offer the broadest ability to enable rapid  reliable access to applications and data for our customers 
we intend to enhance our position as a leader and innovator in the wan optimization market 
we also intend to continue to sell new capabilities  such as our new cloud solutions  into our installed base and to new customers 
continuing investments in research and development are critical to maintaining our technological advantage  
table of contents enhance and extend our product lines we plan to introduce enhancements to our product capabilities in order to address our customers size and application requirements 
we also plan to introduce new products to extend our market and utilize our technology platform to extend our capabilities  extend our technology partner ecosystem we plan to enhance our product capabilities via integration of partner technologies  in particular by increasing the selection of third party applications on the riverbed services platform  increase market awareness to generate increased demand for our products  we will continue promoting our brand and the effectiveness of our comprehensive it performance solutions  scale our distribution channels growth in revenue and increase in market share are key goals for us 
we sell our products directly through our sales force and indirectly through channel partners 
we derived of our revenue through indirect channels in we intend to expand our direct sales force and leverage our indirect channels to extend our geographic reach and market penetration  and enhance and extend our support and services capabilities on an ongoing basis  we plan to enhance and extend our support and services capabilities to continue to support our growing global customer base 
major trends affecting our financial results company outlook we believe that our current value proposition  which enables customers to improve the performance of their applications and access to their data across wans  while also offering the ability to simplify it infrastructure and realize significant capital and operating cost savings  should allow us to continue to grow our business 
our product revenue growth rate will depend significantly on continued growth in the wan optimization  network performance management  and the virtual application delivery controller markets  and our ability to continue to attract new customers in those markets and generate additional sales from existing customers 
our growth in support and services revenue is dependent upon increasing the number of products under support contracts  which is dependent on both growing our installed base of customers and renewing existing support contracts 
our future profitability and rate of growth will be directly affected by the continued acceptance of our products in the marketplace  as well as the timing and size of orders  product mix  average selling prices and costs of our products and general economic conditions 
our ability to achieve profitability in the future will also be affected by the extent to which we must incur additional expenses to expand our sales  support  marketing  development  and general and administrative capabilities to grow our business 
the largest component of our expenses is personnel costs 
personnel costs consist of salaries  benefits and incentive compensation for our employees  including commissions for sales personnel and stock based compensation 
revenue our revenue has grown rapidly since we began shipping products in may  increasing from million in to million in revenue grew by in from million in we believe that our revenue growth in and  is a positive sign that our products have a significant value proposition to our customers and that the markets that we compete in are still expanding 
costs and expenses operating expenses consist of sales and marketing  research and development  general and administrative expenses  and acquisition related costs 
personnel related costs  including stock based 
table of contents compensation  are the most significant component of each of these expense categories 
as of december   we had  employees  an increase of from the  employees at december  the increase in employees is the most significant driver behind the increase in costs and operating expenses in the increase in employees was required to support our increased revenue 
the timing of additional hires has and could materially affect our operating expenses  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue  in any particular period 
stock based compensation expense stock based compensation expense and related payroll taxes were million  million  and million in the years ended december    and respectively 
we expect to continue to incur significant stock based compensation expense and anticipate further growth in stock based compensation expense as our employee base grows because we expect stock based compensation to continue to play an important part in the overall compensation structure for our employees 
stock based compensation expense and related payroll tax was as follows year ended december  in thousands cost of product cost of support and services sales and marketing research and development general and administrative total stock based compensation expense and related payroll taxes acquisitions in the third quarter of  we acquired zeus technology ltd 
and aptimize ltd  to expand our product offerings in the virtual application delivery controller and web content optimization markets 
combined  the total acquisition date fair value of consideration transferred was approximately million  which included initial payments of million in cash  of which million was placed in escrow to secure the sellers indemnification obligations  million was paid upon delivery of the final aptimize closing balance sheet  million was paid upon the finalization of the zeus closing balance sheet and the estimated fair value of acquisition related contingent consideration of million 
also included in the initial payments were million of prepaid compensation costs 
we have preliminarily recorded million of goodwill  million of identifiable intangible assets  including million of in process technology  deferred tax liabilities of million and million of net other tangible liabilities related to these acquisitions 
the results of operations of these companies are included in our consolidated results for the period subsequent to the respective acquisition dates 
in  we recognized million in revenue from the sale of these acquired companies products and services and we recognized million of operating expenses  which included million of acquisition related intangible amortization  million of stock based compensation costs and million of acquisition related compensation costs 
during fiscal  we acquired two companies to expand our product offerings 
these acquisitions were not significant  individually or in the aggregate 
combined  the total purchase price for these acquisitions was approximately million  which was paid in cash 
we recorded million of goodwill  million of identifiable intangible assets  including million of in process technology intangible assets  million of deferred tax liabilities  and million of net tangible liabilities 
the results of operations of these companies are included in our consolidated results for the 
table of contents period subsequent to the respective acquisition dates 
in the year ended december   we recognized million in revenue from the sale of these acquired companies products and services  and we recognized million of operating expenses  which included million of acquisition related intangible amortization  million of transaction and integration costs  million of acquisition related compensation costs and million of stock based compensation costs 
during  we acquired mazu networks  inc mazu 
the results of operations of mazu are included in our consolidated results for the period subsequent to the acquisition date 
in the years ended december  and  we recognized million and million in revenue  respectively  from the sale of mazu products and services 
in the years ended december  and  we recognized million and million  respectively  of acquisition related compensation costs 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
we believe that the estimates and judgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates and judgments are made 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our consolidated financial statements could be adversely affected 
the accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates  judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition  stock based compensation  goodwill  intangible assets and impairment assessment  accounting for business combinations  accounting for income taxes and inventory valuation 
our critical accounting policies have been discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all of the following have occurred we have entered into a legally binding arrangement with a customer  delivery has occurred  customer payment is deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies and significant uncertainties  and collection is reasonably assured 
the majority of our product revenue includes hardware appliances containing software components that function together to provide the essential functionality of the product 
therefore  our hardware appliances are considered non software deliverables 
most non software products and services qualify as separate units of accounting because they have value to the customer on a standalone basis and our revenue arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to delivered products 
we account for non software arrangements with multiple deliverables  which generally include support services sold with each of our hardware appliances  using the relative selling price method under the revenue recognition guidance for multiple deliverable arrangements 
our product revenue also includes revenue from the sale of stand alone software products 
stand alone software may operate on our hardware appliance  but does not function with the hardware to deliver the product s essential functionality 
stand alone software products generally include a perpetual license to our software 
stand alone software sales are subject to the industry specific software revenue recognition guidance 

table of contents certain arrangements with multiple deliverables may have stand alone software deliverables that are subject to the software revenue recognition guidance along with non software deliverables 
the revenue for these multiple deliverable arrangements is allocated to the stand alone software deliverables as a group and the non software deliverables based on the relative selling prices of all of the deliverables in the arrangement 
the amount of product and services revenue recognized for arrangements with multiple deliverables is impacted by our valuation of relative selling prices 
we apply the selling price hierarchy using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe when available  third party evidence of selling price tpe if vsoe does not exist  and estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
vsoe of fair value for elements of an arrangement is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for a deliverable when sold separately  and vsoe for support services is further measured by the renewal rate offered to the customer 
in determining vsoe  we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range  generally evidenced by a substantial majority of such historical stand alone transactions falling within a reasonably narrow range of the median rates 
in addition  we consider major service groups  geographies  customer classifications  and other variables in determining vsoe 
we are typically not able to determine tpe for our products or services 
tpe is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately 
generally  our go to market strategy differs from that of our peers and our offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained 
furthermore  we are unable to reliably determine what similar competitor products selling prices are on a stand alone basis 
when we are unable to establish the estimated stand alone value of our non software deliverables using vsoe or tpe  we use esp in our allocation of arrangement consideration 
the objective of esp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand alone basis 
we determine esp for a product or service by considering multiple factors including  but not limited to  cost of products  gross margin objectives  pricing practices  geographies  customer classes and distribution channels 
for stand alone software sales  we recognize revenue based on software revenue recognition guidance 
under the software revenue recognition guidance  we use the residual method to recognize revenue when an agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and vsoe of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists 
in the majority of our contracts  the only element that remains undelivered at the time of delivery of the product is support services 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered stand alone software  which is typically support services  is deferred and the remaining portion of the contract fee is recognized as product revenue 
if evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered stand alone software elements does not exist  all revenue is generally deferred and recognized when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established 
when the undelivered stand alone software for which we do not have vsoe of fair value is support  revenue for the entire arrangement is bundled and recognized ratably over the support period 
for our non software deliverables  we allocate the arrangement consideration based on the relative selling price of the deliverables 
for our hardware appliances we use the esp of the deliverable 
for our support and services  we generally use vsoe as our relative selling price 
when we are unable to establish vsoe for our support and services  we use esp in our allocation of arrangement consideration 
we regularly review vsoe and esp 
as our go to market strategies evolve  we may modify our pricing practices in the future  which could result in changes in selling prices  including both vsoe and esp 

table of contents for sales to direct end users and channel partners  including value added resellers  value added distributors  service providers  and systems integrators  we recognize product revenue upon delivery  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
for our hardware appliances  delivery occurs upon transfer of title and risk of loss  which is generally upon shipment 
it is our practice to identify an end user prior to shipment to a channel partner 
for end users and channel partners  we generally have no significant obligations for future performance such as rights of return or pricing credits 
shipping charges billed to customers are included in product revenue and the related shipping costs are included in cost of product revenue 
support and services consist of support services  professional services  and training 
support services include repair and replacement of defective hardware appliances  software updates and access to technical support personnel 
software updates provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades and to maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period 
revenue for support services is recognized on a straight line basis over the service contract term  which is typically one to three years 
professional services are recognized upon delivery or completion of performance 
professional service arrangements are typically short term in nature and are largely completed within days from the start of service 
training services are recognized upon delivery of the training 
our fees are typically considered to be fixed or determinable at the inception of an arrangement  generally based on specific products and quantities to be delivered 
substantially all of our contracts do not include rights of return or acceptance provisions 
to the extent that our agreements contain such terms  we recognize revenue once the acceptance provisions or right of return lapses 
payment terms to customers generally range from net to days 
in the event payment terms are provided that differ from our standard business practices  the fees are deemed to not be fixed or determinable and revenue is recognized when the payments become due  provided the remaining criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
we assess the ability to collect from our customers based on a number of factors  including credit worthiness of the customer and past transaction history of the customer 
if the customer is not deemed credit worthy  we defer revenue from the arrangement until payment is received and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
stock based compensation stock based awards granted include stock options  restricted stock units rsus  and stock purchased under our employee stock purchase plan the purchase plan 
stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the awards  and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period only for those equity awards expected to vest 
the fair value of the rsus is determined based on the stock price on the date of grant 
the fair value of the rsus is amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which is generally three to four years 
we estimated the fair value of stock options and stock purchased under our purchase plan using the black scholes model 
this model utilizes the estimated fair value of common stock and requires that  at the date of grant  we use the expected term of the grant  the expected volatility of the price of our common stock  risk free interest rates and expected dividend yield of our common stock 
the fair value is amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which is generally three to four years for stock options  and six months to two years for stock purchased under our purchase plan 
the expected term represents the period that stock options are expected to be outstanding 
during the first three quarters of and for the years ended december   we elected to use the simplified method of determining the expected term of stock options due to insufficient historical exercise data as a publicly traded company 
for the year ended december  and during the 
table of contents fourth quarter of  we determined that we had sufficient historical information to use a method based on historical exercise patterns and post vesting termination behavior  which we believe is more representative of our expected term 
during the first three quarters of and for the years ended december   the computation of our expected volatility for stock options was based on the historical volatility of comparable companies from a representative peer group selected based on industry  financial and market capitalization data  due to insufficient historical volatility data as a publicly traded company 
for the year ended december  and during the fourth quarter of  we determined that we had sufficient historical volatility data to use a blended historical and implied volatility 
the computation of expected volatility for the purchase plan for the years ended december   and is based on our historical volatility 
accounting for business combinations in our business combinations  we are required to recognize the assets acquired  liabilities assumed  contractual contingencies  and contingent consideration at their fair value on the acquisition date 
this process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially at acquisition date with respect to intangible assets  estimated contingent consideration payments and pre acquisition contingencies 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made have been reasonable and appropriate  they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired company and are inherently uncertain 
examples of critical estimates in accounting for acquisitions include but are not limited to the estimated fair value of the acquisition related contingent consideration  which is performed using a probability weighted discounted cash flow model based upon the forecasted achievement of post acquisition bookings targets  the future expected cost to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and the estimated cash flows from the products when completed  the future expected cash flows from product sales  support agreements  consulting contracts  other customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents  and the discount rates 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 
additionally  any change in the fair value of the acquisition related contingent consideration subsequent to the acquisition date  including changes from events after the acquisition date  such as changes in our estimate of the bookings that are expected to be achieved  will be recognized in earnings in the period of the estimated fair value change 
goodwill  intangible assets and impairment assessments goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter and more frequently if certain indicators are present 
in the event that we determine that the carrying value of our single reporting unit is less than the reporting unit s fair value  we will incur an impairment charge for the amount of the difference during the quarter in which the determination is made 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of and concluded that no impairment existed at december  
table of contents intangible assets that have a finite life are amortized over their useful lives 
on a periodic basis  we evaluate the estimated remaining useful life of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization 
the carrying amounts of these assets are periodically reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of each asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate 
in the event that we determine certain assets are not fully recoverable  we will incur an impairment charge for those assets or portion thereof during the quarter in which the determination is made 
recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate 
if the asset is considered to be impaired  the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset 
we did not recognize any goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges in the years ended december   or accounting for income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  income tax expenses or benefits are recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
the measurement of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on provisions of currently enacted tax laws 
the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not contemplated 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income tax expense and tax contingencies in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating current income tax expense together with assessing temporary differences in the treatment of items for tax purposes versus financial accounting purposes that may create net deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we rely on estimates and assumptions in preparing our income tax provision 
we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets  including our recent earnings experience by jurisdiction  expectations of future taxable income  and the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes  as well as other relevant factors 
we may establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
due to inherent complexities arising from the nature of our businesses  future changes in income tax law  or variances between our actual and anticipated operating results  we make certain judgments and estimates 
therefore  actual income taxes could materially vary from these estimates 
as part of our accounting for business combinations  a portion of the purchase price was allocated to goodwill and intangible assets 
amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets are generally not tax deductible  however  deferred taxes have been recorded for non deductible amortization expenses as a part of the purchase price allocation 
in the event of an impairment charge associated with goodwill  such charges are generally not tax deductible and would increase the effective tax rate in the quarter any impairment is recorded 
we are subject to periodic audits by the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities 
these audits may challenge certain tax positions we have taken  such as the timing and amount of deductions and allocation of taxable income to the various tax jurisdictions 
income tax contingencies are accounted for in accordance with authoritative guidance  and may require significant management judgment in estimating final outcomes 
actual results could materially differ from these estimates and could significantly affect the effective tax rate and cash flows in future years 

table of contents inventory valuation inventory consists of hardware and related component parts and is stated at the lower of cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
a portion of our inventory relates to evaluation units located at customer locations  as some of our customers test our equipment prior to purchasing 
inventory that is obsolete or in excess of our forecasted demand is written down to its estimated realizable value based on historical usage  expected demand  and with respect to evaluation units  the historical conversion rate  the age of the units  and the estimated loss of utility 
inherent in our estimates of market value in determining inventory valuation are estimates related to economic trends  future demand for our products  the timing of new product introductions and technological obsolescence of our products 
inventory write downs are recognized as cost of product and amounted to approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
results of operations revenue we derive our revenue from sales of our appliances and software licenses and from support and services 
product revenue primarily consists of revenue from sales of our steelhead  cascade and stingray products and is typically recognized upon delivery 
support and services revenue includes unspecified software license updates and product support 
support revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual period  which is typically one year 
service revenue includes professional services and training  which to date has not been significant  and is recognized as the services are performed

support and services revenue as a percentage of total revenues remained relatively consistent with the prior year as our renewal rate of support contracts by existing customers remained stable 
as our customer base grows  we expect our revenue generated from support and services to increase  however  we expect the renewal rate of support contracts by existing customers to remain level 
we generated of our revenue in the year ended december  from international locations  compared to in the year ended december  we continue to expand into international locations and introduce our products in new markets and expect international revenue to increase in dollar amount over time

support and services revenue as a percentage of total revenues remained relatively consistent with the prior year as our renewal rate of support contracts by existing customers remained stable 
cost of revenue and gross margin cost of product revenue consists of the costs of the appliance hardware  manufacturing  shipping and logistics costs  expenses for inventory obsolescence  warranty obligations and amortization of acquisition related intangibles 
we utilize third parties to assist in the design of and to manufacture our appliance hardware  embed our proprietary software and perform shipping logistics 
cost of support and service revenue consists of personnel costs of technical support and professional services personnel  spare parts and logistics services 
as we expand internationally and into other sectors  we may incur additional costs to conform our products to comply with local laws or local product specifications 
in addition  as we expand internationally  we will continue to hire additional technical support personnel to support our growing international customer base 

table of contents our gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors  including the mix and average selling prices of our products  new product introductions and enhancements  the cost of our appliance hardware  expenses for inventory obsolescence and warranty obligations  cost of support and service personnel  and the mix of distribution channels through which our products are sold

the increase in cost of product revenue was also attributable to increased amortization of acquisition related intangible assets of million  increased expense for inventory obsolescence of million  primarily due to excess inventory caused by anticipated new product introductions  million related to increased personnel costs and million due to increased cost of hard drives in the fourth quarter of due to supply chain disruptions from flooding in thailand 
we expect the increase in cost of hard drives to continue into the first quarter of cost of support and services revenue increased million  or  as we added more technical support headcount domestically and abroad to support our growing customer base 
technical support and services headcount was employees as of december  compared to employees as of december  in addition  cost of support and services increased million due to higher transportation  warehousing and duties costs to support a larger customer base 
gross margins remained at in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  product gross margins increased to in the year ended december  from in the year ended december  as a result of volume leverage and favorable product mix 
gross margins for support and services decreased slightly to in the year ended december  compared to in the year ended december   primarily due to certain redundant transportation and warehousing costs as we converted to a new logistics provider

product gross margins increased to in the year ended december  from in the year ended december  as a result of volume leverage and favorable product mix 
gross margins for support and services remained at 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses represent the largest component of our operating expenses and include personnel costs  sales commissions  marketing programs and facilities costs 
marketing programs are intended to generate revenue from new and existing customers  and are expensed as incurred 
we plan to continue to make investments in sales and marketing with the intent to add new customers and increase penetration within our existing customer base by increasing the number of sales personnel worldwide  expanding our domestic and international sales and marketing activities  increasing channel penetration  building brand awareness and sponsoring additional marketing events 
we expect future sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase and continue to be our most significant operating expense 
generally  sales personnel are not immediately productive and sales and marketing expenses do not immediately result in increased revenue 
hiring additional sales personnel reduces short term operating margins until the sales personnel become productive and generate revenue 
accordingly  the timing of sales personnel hiring and the rate at which they become productive will affect our future performance

as part of our accounting for the acquisition of mazu in the first quarter of  we established deferred tax assets for federal net operating loss carryforwards and r d credit carryforwards that are subject to limitation under section of the internal revenue code 
we recorded a valuation allowance of million related to a portion of the federal net operating loss carryforwards and r d credit carryforwards that were not more likely than not to be realized 
as of december   we reevaluated the need for a valuation allowance on these deferred tax assets by considering positive and negative evidence as required by the related accounting guidance 
as a result of this evaluation  we concluded that it is more likely than not that we will have sufficient future taxable income to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards 
accordingly  we reversed the valuation allowance and recorded an income tax benefit of million in in the year ended december   management concluded that a valuation allowance was needed on our california income tax credit carryforwards 
due to a change in our forecasted income allocated to california for tax years after  it is more likely than not the california income tax credits carryforwards will not be utilized in the foreseeable future 
accordingly  we have established a valuation allowance against the tax credits 
the amount of the valuation allowance against the california credits was million and million  net of federal benefits  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during the year ended december   we made an election to change the tax status of our uk subsidiaries to entities that are disregarded for federal and state income tax purposes 
as a result of the change in tax status  we recorded a tax benefit of million to record certain deferred tax assets resulting from the change 
we recorded deferred charges during the year ended december  related to the deferral of income tax expense on intercompany profits that resulted from the sale of our intellectual property rights including intellectual property acquired during the current year outside of north and south america to our singapore subsidiary 
the deferred charges are included in the prepaid expenses and other current assets and the other assets lines of the consolidated balance sheets in the amounts of million and million  respectively 
the deferred charges are amortized as a component of income tax expense over the five year economic life of the intellectual property 
beginning in the year ended december   we are subject to a reduced income tax rate in singapore as a result of certain employment and spending commitments 
the reduced tax rate is effective through we realized no tax savings in because of net local tax losses 
during  we reduced our current federal  foreign and state taxes payable by million for the excess tax benefits from stock option exercises and other employee stock programs  offsetting

we are subject to income tax in the us as well as numerous state and foreign jurisdictions 
with the exception of several states  we are no longer subject to federal  state and local income tax examinations for years before  although carryforward attributes that were generated prior to may still be adjusted upon examination by the internal revenue service and the california franchise tax board if the attributes either have been or will be used in a future period

in addition  a significant portion of our quarterly sales typically occurs during the last month of the quarter  
table of contents which we believe reflects customer buying patterns of products similar to ours and other products in the technology industry generally 
as a result  our quarterly operating results are difficult to predict even in the near term 
commencing with the first shipment of our products in the second quarter of  revenue has increased each quarter over the prior year quarter  due to increases in the number of products and support and services sold to new and existing customers and international expansion 
cost of revenue has increased each quarter over the prior year quarter in absolute dollars  but has decreased over time as a percentage of revenue 
the increase in gross margins is primarily due to higher margins on product revenue as a result of lower unit product costs 
operating expenses have increased over time  as we continued to add headcount and related costs to accommodate our growing business

since the fourth quarter of  we have expanded our operations internationally 
our sales contracts are principally denominated in us dollars and therefore changes in foreign exchange rates have not materially affected our cash flows from operations 
as we fund our international operations  our cash and cash equivalents are affected by changes in exchange rates 
in  we concluded 
table of contents acquisitions in international locations that increased our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
to date  the foreign currency effect on our cash and cash equivalents has not been material 
cash provided by operating activities our largest source of operating cash flows is the cash collections from our customers 
our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel related expenditures  product costs  outside services  and rent payments 
our cash flows from operating activities will continue to be affected principally by the extent to which we grow our revenue and spend on hiring personnel in order to grow our business 
the timing of hiring sales personnel in particular affects cash flows as there is a lag between the hiring of sales personnel and the generation of revenue and related cash flows from their sales efforts 
cash provided by operating activities increased by million to million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in cash flow of million from operations after adjusting for non cash items  including depreciation and amortization  and stock based compensation  offset by cash used for excess tax benefits from employee stock plans and deferred taxes  and million from the change in operating assets and liabilities

our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  the expansion of our sales and marketing activities  the timing and extent of expansion into new territories  the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products  and the continuing market acceptance of our products 
in the third quarter of  we acquired zeus and aptimize for approximately million of cash

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk our sales contracts are principally denominated in us dollars and therefore our revenue and receivables are not subject to significant foreign currency risk 
we do incur certain operating expenses in currencies other than the us dollar and therefore are subject to volatility in cash flows due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly changes in the british pound  euro  australian dollar and singapore dollar 
during the years ended december   and  we did not enter into any hedging contracts since exchange rate fluctuations have had minimal impact on our operating results and cash flows 
starting in the first quarter of  we entered into forward contracts to manage our exposure to foreign currency volatility that exists as part of our ongoing business operations 
we utilize cash flow hedges to reduce the exchange rate impact on a portion of our operating expenses 
contracts are denominated primarily in british pounds  euros and singapore dollars 
we do not enter into any foreign exchange derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
pursuant to the acquisition of zeus  we recorded a u 
s dollar denominated liability of million for the acquisition related contingent consideration on our uk subsidiary  which has a british pound functional currency 
this liability is subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  which could have a negative impact on our statement of operations 
interest rate sensitivity we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents  and investments totaling million and million at december  and  respectively 
cash and cash equivalents of million and million at december  and december   respectively  are held for working capital purposes and include highly liquid investments with a maturity of ninety days or less at the time of purchase 
cash equivalents consist primarily of money market mutual funds  government sponsored enterprise obligations  treasury bills  and other money market securities 
investments of million and million at december  and december   respectively  consist of government sponsored enterprise obligations  treasury bills  fdic backed certificates of deposit and corporate bonds and notes 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
due to the high investment quality and relatively short duration of these investments  we do not believe that we have any material exposure to changes in the fair market value as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates  however  will reduce future investment income 
interest rates on highly liquid short term investments such as us treasury bills declined from to and remained low in this has caused a significant reduction in our investment income 
in addition  the volatility in the credit markets increases the risk of write downs of investments to fair market value
