overview we experienced increased demand levels in across a number of areas of our business as both the industry and most of our end markets experienced another year of improving economic conditions 
overall  our volumes  measured in total pounds shipped  increased in compared to  with relatively stronger increases in our oem business  as well as in industrial related product categories  as market demand in both areas was favorably impacted by increased industrial output in the us from levels 
other areas remain challenging  however  with particular weakness persisting in those channels and product categories linked to construction end markets 
additionally  overall demand levels in the us remain below pre recessionary levels  as the magnitude of economic growth and recovery in the developing world has outpaced that in the us generally  we also experienced improved pricing across our business during the course of  but also experienced significant copper price volatility throughout  most notably a sharp decline in copper prices in the fourth quarter of the decrease in copper prices during the second half of  and most notably during the fourth quarter  appeared to reflect a number of wide ranging factors  including fear of an economic slowdown  particularly within developing countries  coupled by decreased financial and investor interest in a wide range of commodity based investments  including copper 
as a result  the average monthly price of copper cathode on the comex decreased during the second half of  with a total decrease of recorded between the monthly average of per pound for june and an average of per pound in december copper prices have subsequently increased significantly  increasing from year end levels  during the first two months of  with the average monthly price of copper on the comex reaching in february such copper price fluctuations can significantly impact our sales and profitability  as copper constitutes the primary component of our product input costs  accounting for approximately of our total costs of goods sold in specifically  sharp copper price changes can significantly impact the spread between the cost of copper in our products and the prices we are able to charge for our products 
recently  as oil prices have increased  we have also begun to see signs of inflationary pressures in the cost of oil based resins and freight costs 
despite the challenges posed by such factors  our overall financial and operating performance in was strong earnings per diluted share of for  as compared to for on an adjusted basis  we recorded adjusted earnings per diluted share of  as compared to adjusted earnings per diluted share of in  
table of contents ebitda for reached million  as compared to ebitda of million in on an adjusted basis  we recorded adjusted ebitda of million in  as compared to adjusted ebitda of million in  overall reported revenues increased in to million as compared to million in  with an increase of in total volume shipped  strong improvement in both oem and distribution operating income  with increases of and  respectively  recorded in as compared to  on august   we entered into a new million  five year revolving credit facility agreement with an accordion feature that allows us to increase our borrowings by an additional million the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility gives us greater flexibility than our former credit facility in many respects

both the above noted gaap results and non gaap measures  including our definition of such non gaap measures and their reconciliation to gaap measures  are set forth in greater detail as part of the consolidated results of operations section that follows 
acquisitions during the second quarter of  we utilized cash on hand  as well as borrowings under our credit facility  to complete three business combination transactions collectively  the acquisitions  as set forth below 
each of these acquisitions was structured as cash transactions  with aggregate consideration totaling million 
as further discussed below  we believe these acquisitions represent significant opportunities for us  including the strengthening and greater diversification of our overall portfolio 
acquisition of the assets of the designers edge de on april   we acquired certain assets of de  a leading designer and distributor of specialty lighting products in the us and canada  with sales in excess of million 
the total purchase price for the assets acquired  primarily trade receivables and merchandise inventories  was million  subject to certain purchase price adjustments 
the acquisition of de s assets significantly expands our market position across a wide range of lighting product categories  including industrial  work and utility  as well as products for security and landscape applications 
we fully integrated the acquired assets of de into our existing operations during the second quarter of acquisition of the assets of first capitol wire and cable fcwc and continental wire and cable cwc on april   we acquired certain assets of fcwc and cwc  both of which were privately held entities based in york  pennsylvania  with cwc being a owned subsidiary of fcwc 
these two entities  which had annual combined sales in excess of million  are leading manufacturers of industrial wire and cable products used across a number of commercial  utility and industrial end markets 
the total purchase price for the assets acquired  primarily merchandise inventories and production equipment  was million  inclusive of working capital adjustments of million 
the acquisition of the assets of fcwc and cwc has allowed us to expand our capabilities  product offerings and capacity for producing a wide assortment of high quality industrial cables 
we fully integrated the assets of fcwc and cwc into our operations during the second quarter of acquisition of technology research corporation trc on may   we completed the acquisition of of the outstanding stock of trc 
for its fiscal year ended march   trc had revenues of approximately million and net income of million 
trc 
table of contents is a recognized leader in providing cost effective engineered solutions for applications involving power management and control  intelligent battery systems technology and electrical safety products based on proven ground fault sensing and fire shield technology 
these products are designed  manufactured and distributed to the consumer  commercial and industrial markets worldwide 
trc also supplies power monitors and control equipment to the united states military and its prime contractors 
trc was publicly traded on the nasdaq prior to its acquisition by coleman 
we completed the trc acquisition as the result of a successful public tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of trc 
the total purchase price consideration for trc was approximately million  including the acquisition date fair value of an approximate interest already held by coleman prior to the completion of the acquisition of trc 
the company believes trc s commercial and consumer products segment broadens our current electrical products platform 
in addition  trc s battery  power storage  and power management systems represent new product lines for coleman 
purchase accounting related to the acquisitions the acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  we have allocated the purchase price for each acquisition to the net assets acquired based on the related estimated fair values at each respective acquisition date 
the expected long term growth  increased market position and expected synergies to be generated from the acquisitions are the primary factors which gave rise to acquisition prices for each of the acquisitions which resulted in the recognition of goodwill 
except as pertaining to de  the purchase price allocations have been finalized 
we are in the process of negotiating purchase price adjustments for the de acquisition  which may result in a corresponding adjustment to the total de purchase price as well as the value of assets acquired 
accordingly  the provisional measurement of accounts receivable  inventories  property  plant  and equipment  intangible assets  taxes  and goodwill are subject to change 
any change in the acquisition date fair value of the acquired net assets will change the amount of the purchase price allocated to goodwill 
outlook looking to  we anticipate continued modest growth in demand 
we believe our business should benefit from our expanded product line brought about both by our acquisitions and the new products we have internally developed and brought to market over the past two years 
commodity prices and their impact on our business  however  remain a concern  as further significant fluctuations in copper prices and other raw material inputs such as petroleum based compounds and transportation costs could impact our profitability 
if general us economic conditions improve further in  we would expect to benefit given the diversity of our product offerings despite challenges which may persist in particular end markets 
we remain confident the company is well positioned heading into we have and intend to continue to pursue acquisition opportunities that have the potential to increase the size of our business operation or provide us with strategic advantages 
the consummation of any acquisition  including those currently under consideration  may result in increased borrowing under our revolving credit facility 
consolidated results of operations the acquisitions are included in our consolidated results of operations beginning from each respective acquisition date 
accordingly  the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  includes nine months of operations for the assets acquired in connection with the de acquisition  approximately eight months of operations for the assets acquired in connection with both the fcwc and cwc acquisitions  and approximately seven and a half months of operations related to the acquisition of trc 
the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  does not include the impact of the acquisitions 

table of contents in addition to net income determined in accordance with gaap  we use certain non gaap measures in assessing our operating performance 
these non gaap measures used by management include ebitda  which we define as net income before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization expense ebitda  adjusted ebitda  which is our measure of ebitda adjusted to exclude the impact of certain specifically identified items adjusted ebitda  and adjusted earnings per share  which we calculate as diluted earnings per share adjusted to exclude the estimated per share impact of the same specifically identified items used to calculate adjusted ebitda adjusted eps 
for the periods presented in this report  the specifically identified items include asset impairments  restructuring charges  the gain on available for sale securities recorded in the second quarter of relative to our investment in trc at the date of acquisition  acquisition related costs  the favorable impact of an insurance settlement received in for a inventory related theft  the loss recorded in connection with the extinguishment of our senior notes in  and share based compensation expense 
we believe both ebitda and adjusted ebitda serve as appropriate measures to be used in evaluating the performance of our business 
we employ the use of these measures in the preparation of our annual operating budgets and in determining levels of operating and capital investments 
we believe both ebitda and adjusted ebitda allow us to readily view operating trends  perform analytical comparisons  determine key personnel bonuses  and identify strategies to improve operating performance 
we also believe both ebitda and adjusted ebitda are performance measures that provide investors  securities analysts and other interested parties a measure of operating results unaffected by differences in capital structures  business acquisitions  capital investment cycles and ages of related assets among otherwise comparable companies in our industry 
however  the usefulness of both ebitda and adjusted ebitda as performance measures are limited by the fact that they both exclude the impact of interest expense  depreciation and amortization expense  and taxes 
we borrow money in order to finance our operations  therefore  interest expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate revenue 
similarly  our use of capital assets makes depreciation and amortization expense a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate income 
since we are subject to state and federal income taxes  any measure that excludes tax expense has material limitations 
due to these limitations  we do not  and you should not  use either ebitda or adjusted ebitda as the only measures of our performance 
we also use  and recommend that you consider  net income in accordance with gaap as a measure of our performance 
finally  other companies may define ebitda and adjusted ebitda differently and  as a result  our measure of ebitda and adjusted ebitda may not be directly comparable to ebitda and adjusted ebitda measures of other companies 
similarly  we believe our use of adjusted eps and adjusted ebitda provides an appropriate measure to use in assessing our performance across periods given that this measure provides an adjustment for certain significant items  the magnitude of which may vary significantly from period to period 
however  we do not  and do not recommend that you  solely use adjusted eps to assess our financial and earnings performance 
we also use  and recommend that you use  diluted earnings per share in addition to adjusted eps in assessing our earnings performance 
finally  other companies may define adjusted eps differently and  as a result  our measure of adjusted eps may not be directly comparable to adjusted eps measures of other companies 
the following tables  which reconcile our measure of adjusted eps to diluted earnings per share  and ebitda and adjusted ebitda to net income  respectively  should be used along with the above statements of income for the periods presented  and the accompanying results of operations review 

table of contents diluted earnings per share  as determined in accordance with gaap  to adjusted eps year ended december  diluted earnings per share asset impairments restructuring charges loss on extinguishment of debt gain on available for sale securities share based compensation expense acquisition related costs insurance related settlement adjusted eps net income  as determined in accordance with gaap  to ebitda and adjusted ebitda year ended december  in thousands net income interest expense a income tax expense depreciation and amortization expense a ebitda asset impairments restructuring charges loss on extinguishment of debt gain on available for sale securities share based compensation expense acquisition related costs insurance related settlement adjusted ebitda a depreciation and amortization expense shown in the above schedule excludes amortization of debt issuance costs  which are included as a component of interest expense 
the nature of each individual item set forth in the table above which has been excluded from diluted earnings per share and net income in order to arrive at our measures of adjusted eps and adjusted ebitda  respectively  for each of the periods presented is detailed in the analysis of operating results that follows 
earnings and performance summary we recorded net income of million or per diluted share in  as compared to million or per diluted share for for  we recorded ebitda of million as compared to ebitda of million in as set forth below  results for these periods were impacted by certain items  the magnitude of which may vary significantly from period to period and  thereby  have a disproportionate effect on the earnings reported for any given period 
the income statement review below contains further detail regarding each of these items 
asset impairments we recorded million million after tax  or per diluted share in non cash asset impairments in related to properties held for sale 

table of contents restructuring charges our results for and included million million after tax or per diluted share and million million after tax or per diluted share  respectively  in restructuring charges 
for  these charges were primarily comprised of severance costs related to an announced realignment of our canadian operations  including the planned elimination of certain support positions in our toronto distribution center and headquarters  which we completed during the fourth quarter of as part of this realignment  at the end of the fourth quarter of  we vacated our current toronto based distribution and headquarters facility  with a majority of our canadian distribution being transitioned to our existing distribution facility in wisconsin and a new  smaller toronto based distribution facility 
restructuring costs for also included lease termination and other holding costs related to facilities closed in prior years  consisting of one leased and one owned facility for which we continue to pay holding costs 
in  restructuring charges primarily relate to lease liabilities associated with certain leased facilities closed during which were acquired in  as well as our two plant closures 
loss on extinguishment of debt we refinanced our senior notes during the first quarter of by issuing million in senior notes 
we recorded a loss of million million after tax  or per diluted share associated with this refinancing 
gain on available for sale securities we held a interest in trc at the time we acquired trc 
the fair value of our pre existing interest at the merger date was included in the total purchase price for trc 
as a result  we recorded a non taxable gain of million million after tax  or per diluted shares in the second quarter of  which represented the impact of re measuring the fair value of the equity interest in trc we held before the business combination 
share based compensation expense our results for and included share based compensation expense of million million after tax or per diluted share and million million after tax or per diluted share  respectively 
share based compensation is excluded from our measures of adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps in order for such measures to more closely reflect a measure of underlying operating results given periodic fluctuations in the estimated fair value of a significant portion of the underlying share based instruments 
acquisition related costs our results for included acquisition related costs of million million after tax or per diluted share 
acquisition related costs include outside legal  consulting  and other fees  and direct expenses incurred in relative to the acquisitions 
these costs are excluded from our measures of adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps so that such measures may more closely reflect underlying operational results 
insurance related settlement in the fourth quarter of  we received million million after tax  or per diluted share in proceeds  in settlement of an insurance related matter pertaining to an inventory theft that occurred in at a since closed facility 
excluding the impact of the above noted items  our results for as compared to  primarily reflected the impact of improved market conditions which have resulted in increased demand levels  and the favorable impact of such increased demand on our profitability  primarily in the form of higher overall gross profit  as well as the benefits of our cost reduction and capacity rationalization efforts over the past three years 

table of contents the following table sets forth  for the years indicated  our consolidated statement of operations data in thousands of dollars and as a percentage of net sales

in particular  average comex copper prices increased by in as compared to  increased sales volumes measured in total pounds shipped as set forth below  primarily due to overall market demand growth across a number of end markets  accounted for approximately million  and  the trc acquisition  consummated in the second quarter of  accounted for million in increased net sales 
our results do not include trc 

table of contents the following table sets forth our sales volume by segment  measured in thousands of total pounds shipped  as well as average comex copper prices for the periods presented total sales volume in pounds change thousands  except dollar amounts distribution oem other consolidated average comex copper high month feb dec low month oct jun average year other does not currently track volume through total pounds shipped 
represents the price for one pound of copper on the comex for the periods indicated  with the high and low values representing the highest and lowest monthly average price for each annual period shown  respectfully 
we believe the total volume increases noted above are generally indicative of an overall improvement in market conditions  as we have experienced broad based demand increases across most areas of our business  as well as incremental volume gained from new products 
the higher degree of volume growth experienced in within our oem segment reflects both an expansion of our oem customer base and increased demand from existing customers  which we believe is a function of the relative strength of the industrial related end markets served by our oem segment as compared to the broader us economy 
gross profit the vast majority of the increase in gross profit for  as compared to  was attributable to incremental gross profit generated from the above noted sales increases 
to a lesser degree  the increased gross profit reflects an improvement in our gross profit as a percentage of net sales gross profit rate 
for  our gross profit rate improved by percent as a percentage of net sales  as compared to this improvement in our gross profit rate reflected  in part  the favorable impact of higher margin products brought about by the trc acquisition as well as customer acceptance of product price increases across a number of end markets during that outpaced increases in the related costs of such products 
selling  general and administrative sg a expense the million increase in sg a expenses for  as compared to  included the impact of million in expenses arising directly from the acquisitions  primarily trc  which accounted for approximately million of the total  as well as million of outside legal  consulting and other fees  and direct expenses incurred 
we incurred no such acquisition related costs in in addition  our sg a expenses included the benefit of a million cash settlement we received on an insurance related matter pertaining to an inventory theft that occurred in  at a since closed facility 
excluding the net impact of these items  our sg a expenses increased million in as compared to  and our sg a expenses improved percent as a percentage of net sales 
this million increase in sg a was primarily due to increased commission expense of million due to higher sales volumes  as well as increased payroll and related costs of million  most notably in the form of increased discretionary incentive compensation recorded in  as compared to  given the improvement in our financial results between these two years 
the remaining million represents increases across a number of general expense areas  and the percent improvement in our sg a rate as a percentage of net sales reflected the favorable impact of increased expense leverage as our fixed costs were spread over a higher net sales base 

table of contents intangible amortization expense the increase in intangible amortization for  as compared to  reflects the impact of amortization recorded in relation to the acquisitions partially offset by lower amortization expense recorded in relation to acquisitions made in prior years 
amortization expense relative to intangible assets reflects the fact that such assets are generally amortized using an accelerated amortization method  which reflects our estimate of the pattern in which the economic benefit derived from such assets is to be consumed and  accordingly  results in lower amortization in periods further removed from the period of initial recognition 
restructuring charges we recorded million in restructuring costs in  including most notably  million of severance costs related to the realignment of our toronto distribution facility 
as part of this realignment  at the end of the fourth quarter of  we vacated our current toronto based distribution and headquarters facility  with a majority of our canadian distribution being transitioned to our existing distribution facility in wisconsin and a new  smaller toronto based distribution facility 
restructuring costs also included lease termination and other holding costs related to facilities closed in prior years  currently consisting of one leased and one owned facility for which we continue to pay holding costs 
in  we incurred million in restructuring costs  primarily comprised of holding costs associated with facilities closed throughout and we do not currently have any significant restructuring initiatives planned for accordingly  we anticipate incurring between million and million in restructuring costs in related to existing closed facilities  without giving effect to our successfully negotiating any potential sales  alterations  to or additional subleases  or lease buy outs in relation to one or more of these properties 
however  it should be noted that management regularly assesses the company s cost structure and is also continually adjusting plans and production schedules in light of sales trends  the macro economic environment and other demand indicators  and the possibility exists that we may determine further plant closings  restructurings and workforce reductions are necessary  some of which may be significant 
operating income the following table sets forth operating income by segment  in thousands of dollars and segment operating income as a percentage of segment net sales 
year ended december  year over year change vs 
amount net sales amount net sales change change thousands operating income distribution oem other corporate consolidated operating income segment operating income represents income from continuing operations before interest income or expense  other income or expense  and income taxes 
corporate consists of items not charged or allocated to the segments  including costs for employee relocation  discretionary bonuses  professional fees  restructuring expenses  asset impairments  share based compensation expense  and intangible amortization 
our distribution  oem  and other segments have common production processes  and manufacturing and distribution capacity 
accordingly  we do not identify net assets to our segments 
depreciation expense is not allocated to segments  but is included in manufacturing overhead cost pools and is absorbed into product cost and inventory as each product passes through our numerous manufacturing work centers 
accordingly  as products are sold across our segments  it is impracticable to determine the amount of depreciation expense included in the operating results of each segment 

table of contents distribution operating income improvement for  as compared to  primarily reflected the favorable gross profit impact of the above noted increased sales and volume in the operating income rate improvement primarily reflects increased fixed cost leverage  as such costs were spread over a higher overall net sales base for oem operating income improvement for  as compared to  primarily reflected the favorable gross profit impact of the above noted increased sales and volume in the decrease in operating income rate reflects the fixed margin nature of the majority of our oem business in which higher copper prices inherently lower the realized gross margin percentage 
our other reporting segment recorded an operating loss of million for the approximate seven and a half month period from their acquisition through the year end  which is primarily reflective of the impact of purchase accounting in the form of a step up in acquired inventory value of million  and to a lesser degree sg a expenses which have been absorbed over a lower than expected sales base 
interest expense we incurred increased interest expense due to higher average outstanding borrowings for compared loss on extinguishment of debt we recorded an million loss in resulting from our issuance of million in senior notes and the corresponding extinguishment of our outstanding senior notes 
gain on available for sale securities in the second quarter of  prior to the acquisition of trc  the company owned million shares of trc common stock worth per share as a result of the agreed upon purchase price 
in accordance with relevant accounting guidance  the fair value of the previously owned investment was included in the total purchase price 
as a result of the acquisition of trc  we recognized a gain of million on the difference between our cost basis and the fair value at the acquisition date 
other income loss  net in  we recorded a loss of million as compared to a gain of million in  primarily reflecting the impact of exchange rate changes on our canadian subsidiary 
additionally  in  as part of the trc acquisition  we assumed a contingent liability of trc related to an acquisition made by trc in march included in the preliminary purchase price allocation for trc  was an accrual of million  which represented our best estimate of trc s obligation under the terms of this earn out at the time of our acquisition of trc 
subsequently  during the fourth quarter of  we determined that it was no longer probable the amount of consideration relative to this earn out provision would be paid 
accordingly  we reversed the entire amount of the earn out liability established at the time of the acquisition of trc  million  with a corresponding offset recorded within other income 
asset impairment in  we recorded a total of million in asset impairments in for write downs associated with properties being held for sale 
income tax expense benefit the increase in our tax rate for to  as compared to for  is primarily attributable to changes in the relative jurisdictional mix of income from continuing operations before taxes as well as transaction costs from the acquisitions that were capitalized for tax purposes and that affected the rate and which were not applicable in 
table of contents the following is a reconciliation for the periods indicated of cash flow from operating activities  as determined in accordance with gaap  to ebitda

net sales by groups of products net sales across our four major product lines were as follows year ended december  net sales by groups of products in thousands industrial wire and cable assembled wire and cable products electronic wire fabricated bare wire total as noted previously  we are organized internally according to the customers we serve  which is reflected in the structure of our reportable segments oem  distribution  and other 
therefore  we do not focus internally on the operating performance or profitability of our business by product grouping 
in relation to the data presented above  however  we note that all product categories experienced net sales increases in as compared to  primarily reflective of improved overall market conditions and increased copper prices 
as noted above  the price of copper on the comex  which averaged for  increased from the increase in net sales within the industrial wire and cable product grouping in part reflected both an increase in demand for new products in and strong market demand improvement in this area as industrial output in the us increased from levels 
assembled wire and cable products benefited from underlying volume growth due to the trc acquisition 
while we do not have visibility to the specific end markets into which our products are ultimately sold  based on the nature of  and general applications for such products  we believe the relatively lower level of growth within the electronic wire grouping is reflective of the fact that a portion of the products within this category  such as thermostat and irrigation wire  are used in residential and commercial construction  which have not returned to pre recessionary volume levels 
conversely  the relatively higher level of growth in net sales recorded within fabricated bare wire reflects the improved volume as well as the copper component of such products 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources debt our outstanding debt including capital lease obligations was as follows as of december  in thousands revolving credit facility expiring october  senior notes due february  capital lease obligations total debt as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  as compared to million as of december  we also had approximately million in remaining excess availability under our revolving credit facility at december  revolving credit facility on august   we entered into a new million  five year revolving credit facility agreement with an accordion feature that allows us to increase our borrowings by an additional million the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility replaced a million revolving credit facility which was scheduled to expire in april of the revolving credit facility  which expires on october   is an asset based loan facility  with a million canadian facility sublimit  and which is secured by substantially all of our assets  as further detailed below 
we incurred million in fees and direct costs related to negotiating the revolving credit facility 
these respective fees will be amortized over the life of the revolver 
the interest rate charged on borrowings under the revolving credit facility is based on our election of either the base rate greater of federal funds rate plus and the lender s prime rate plus a range of to or the eurodollar rate plus a range of to  in each case based on quarterly average excess availability under the revolving credit facility 
in addition  we pay an unused line fee of between and based on quarterly average excess availability pursuant to the terms of the revolving credit facility 
pursuant to the terms of the revolving credit facility  we are required to maintain a fixed charge covenant ratio of not less than to for any month during which our excess availability under the revolving credit facility falls below million 
borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility is limited to the lesser of million or the sum of of eligible accounts receivable  of eligible inventory  with a maximum amount of borrowing base availability which may be generated from inventory of million for the us portion and million canadian for the canadian portion  and an advance rate to be of certain appraised real estate and of certain appraised equipment and capped at million  with a million sublimit for letters of credit 
our current availability does not include additional availability that may be generated by adding real estate and certain equipment to the borrowing base 
the revolving credit facility is guaranteed by cci international  inc cci international  trc excluding trc s owned foreign subsidiary  trc honduras  sa de sa and patco electronics patco  each of which are owned domestic subsidiaries  and is secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of each of cci international  trc and patco  including accounts receivable  inventory and any other tangible and intangible assets including real estate  machinery and equipment and intellectual property as well as by a pledge of all the capital stock of cci international  trc and patco and of the capital stock of our canadian foreign subsidiary  but not our chinese owned entity 

table of contents the revolving credit facility creates greater flexibility than our previous revolving credit facility in many respects  including  without limitation  as to the representations and warranties and event of default triggers contained therein  as well as the financial covenants and the covenants that restrict our ability to pay dividends or distributions  permit liens on property  make investments  provide guarantees  enter into merger  acquisitions or consolidations  conduct asset sales  enter into leases or sale and leaseback transactions and enter into transactions with affiliates 
in particular  pursuant to the revolving credit facility i we are no longer required to maintain a minimum of million in excess availability at all times ii our general permitted indebtedness basket has been increased from million to million and iii we are now able to dispose of up to of our consolidated assets in any fiscal year so long as we maintain a excess availability of the greater of million and of the commitments under the revolving credit facility and b a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least to in addition  both the excess availability and fixed charge coverage tests that limit our ability to enter into acquisitions  make investments  repurchase the senior notes and pay dividends have been reduced under the revolving credit facility from those set forth in the previous revolving credit facility 
we maintained greater than million of monthly excess availability throughout as of december   we were in compliance with all of the covenants of our revolving credit facility 
senior notes due senior notes our senior notes mature on february  and have an aggregate principal amount of million and a coupon rate 
interest payments are due on february th and august th 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of the covenants of our senior notes 
our senior notes were issued at a discount in  resulting in proceeds of less than par value 
this discount is being amortized to par value over the remaining life of the senior notes 
the indenture relating to our senior notes contains customary covenants that limit us and our restricted subsidiaries with respect to  among other things  incurring additional indebtedness  making restricted payments  creating liens  paying dividends  consolidating  merging or selling substantially all of their assets  entering into sale and leaseback transactions  and entering into transaction with affiliates 
additionally  all our domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantee the revolving credit facility are required under the indenture to guarantee our obligations under the senior notes 
following our entry into the new revolving credit facility  trc and patco became subsidiary guarantors of the senior notes 
current and future liquidity in general  we require cash for working capital  capital expenditures  debt repayment and interest 
our working capital requirements tend to increase when we experience significant increased demand for products or significant copper price increases 
accordingly  we may be required to borrow against our revolving credit facility in the future upon the occurrence of various events  including increases in the price of copper  which increase our working capital requirements 
our management assesses the future cash needs of our business by considering a number of factors  including earnings and cash flow performance  future working capital needs  current and projected debt service expenses  and planned capital expenditures 
recently we have had to rely on borrowings from the revolver due to higher working capital requirements  driven mainly by higher average copper prices  acquisitions  and acquisition related costs 
we believe that our operating cash flows and borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations  meet our debt service requirements and fund our planned capital expenditures and strategic acquisitions for the foreseeable future 
as of december   we had million in outstanding borrowings against our revolving credit facility and a corresponding million in excess availability under the revolving credit facility  and million in cash and cash equivalents 
as december   we had million and million of cash and cash equivalents held by our canadian and honduran subsidiaries  respectively 

table of contents if we experience a deficiency in earnings compared to our fixed charges in the future  we would need to fund the fixed charges through a combination of cash flows from operations and borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
if cash flows generated from our operations  together with borrowings under our revolving credit facility  are not sufficient to fund our operations  meet our debt service requirements and fund our planned capital expenditures  and we need to seek additional sources of capital  the limitations on our ability to incur debt contained in the revolving credit facility and the indenture relating to our senior notes could prevent us from securing additional capital through the issuance of debt 
in that case  we would need to secure additional capital through other means  such as the issuance of equity 
in addition  we may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if we were not able to secure additional capital  we could be required to delay or forego capital spending or other corporate initiatives  such as the development of products  or acquisition opportunities 
our revolving credit facility permits us to redeem  retire or repurchase our senior notes subject to certain limitations 
we may repurchase the senior notes in the future  but whether we do so will depend on a number of factors and there can be no assurance that we will repurchase any amounts of our senior notes 
in august  our board of directors authorized a two year stock repurchase plan pursuant to which up to million shares of the company s common stock are authorized to be purchased in open market or privately negotiated transactions 
in  we repurchased million shares under the repurchase program 
we may repurchase our common shares in the future but whether we do so will depend on a number of factors and there can be no assurance that we will repurchase any amounts of our common shares 
cash flow summary a summary of our cash flows for and was as follows year ended december  in thousands net income non cash items changes in working capital assets and liabilities net cash from operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash from financing activities effects of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash and equivalents at beginning of year cash and equivalents at end of year operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million and million for and  respectively 
the million increase in cash provided by operating activities for as compared to was largely the result of improved working capital management 
in  working capital requirements required cash of million  as compared to million in our december  receivable balance was million  an increase as compared to million at december   resulting mainly from increased sales in the fourth quarter of  as compared to the fourth quarter of this sales increase was reflective of increased demand levels manifested in higher volumes 
accounts receivable resulted in a use of cash of million in  as compared to million in  an improvement of million  as a result of improving our days sales outstanding in  as compared to our december  inventory balance increased 
table of contents from december   largely due to inventory requirements related to our acquisitions 
as a result  higher average inventory balances resulted in the use of million in  a million improvement from the use of inventory in also resulted from the placement of inventory resulting from our new acquisitions  and accounted for million of total inventory at the conclusion of the use of cash for accounts receivable and inventory was offset by proceeds of cash from accounts payable and accrued liabilities  resulting in million  as a function of increased payables and accruals brought about by the above noted increased inventory levels over the same time period 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities for was million  primarily due to the acquisitions  as discussed above 
during  we purchased no investments  as compared to million in investments during during  we spent million in capital expenditures  as compared to million in  with the increase in capital spending reflecting opportunities to selectively add manufacturing capacity and capabilities  as well as reduce costs 
we expect our capital expenditures to total between million and million  with the expected increase over capital expenditures coming primarily from a number of individual projects planned across our major manufacturing plants designed to improve our manufacturing efficiencies  lower our costs and expand our manufacturing capacity and capabilities 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million in  as compared to million in cash for financing activities in during a net million was provided by borrowing against the revolving credit facility  primarily to fund the acquisitions  as well as million used to repurchase million shares of the company s common stock pursuant to the above noted share repurchase program announced in during  million was provided by financing activities  due primarily to the refinancing of our senior notes during the first quarter of seasonality we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  certain seasonal trends in our net sales and cash flow 
we generally require increased levels of cash during the second and third quarters of the year to build inventories in anticipation of higher demand during the late fall and early winter months 
in general  the trade receivables generated from these periods of relatively higher sales is subsequently collected during the late fourth and early first quarter of each year 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize sales of our products when the products are shipped to customers and title passes to the customer in accordance with the terms of sale 
we provide incentive allowances to our customers  with the amount of such 
table of contents promotional allowances being tied primarily to the particular customer s level of purchasing activity during a specified time period or periods 
we record an accrual for such promotional allowances and reflect the expenses as a reduction of our net sales when we determine that it is probable the allowances will be earned by the customer and the amount of the allowances can be reasonably estimated 
we base our accruals primarily on sales activity and our historical experience with each customer 
allowance for uncollectible accounts we record an allowance for uncollectible accounts to reflect management s best estimate of losses inherent in our receivables as of the balance sheet date given the facts available to us at the time the allowance is recorded 
establishing this allowance involves considerable judgment 
in calculating the necessary allowance for uncollectible accounts  we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers 
we consider both the current financial condition of individual customers and historical write off patterns in establishing our allowance 
when we become aware that  due to deterioration of their financial condition or for some other reason  a particular customer is unable or unwilling to pay an amount owed to us  we record a specific allowance for receivables related to that customer to reflect our best estimate of the realizability of amounts owed 
actual future collections of receivables could differ significantly from our estimates as a function of future  unforeseen changes in general  industry and specific customers financial conditions 
in addition  we reserve for customer credits and discounts expected to be issued relative to our accounts receivable balance 
these reserves are intended to reflect an estimate of future credits and discounts that are probable of issuance in relation to the existing accounts receivable balance  and these estimates are based on historical experience 
inventories inventories include material  labor and overhead costs and are recorded at the lower of cost or market using the first in first out fifo method 
in applying fifo  we evaluate the realizability of our inventory on a product by product basis 
in circumstances where inventory levels are in excess of anticipated market demand  where inventory is deemed technologically obsolete or not saleable due to its condition or where the inventory cost for an item exceeds its net realizable value  we record a charge to cost of goods sold and reduce the inventory to its net realizable value 
copper constitutes our primary inventory component 
plant and equipment and other long lived assets plant and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated over their estimated useful lives  ranging from three to twenty years  using principally the straight line method for financial reporting purposes and accelerated methods for tax reporting purposes 
our other long lived assets consist primarily of customer related intangible assets recorded in connection with acquisitions occurring in these intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives using an accelerated amortization methodology which reflects our estimate of the pattern in which the economic benefit derived from such assets is to be consumed 
the carrying value of all long lived assets is evaluated periodically to determine if adjustment to the depreciation period or the carrying value is warranted 
when events and circumstances indicate that our long lived assets should be reviewed for possible impairment  we test for the existence of impairment by developing and utilizing projections of future cash flows expected to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of the assets or asset groups in question 
our asset groups reflect the shared nature of our facilities and manufacturing capacity 
expected cash flows are projected on an undiscounted basis over the remaining life of the assets or asset groups in question to determine whether such cash flows are expected to exceed the recorded carrying amount of the assets involved 
if we identify the existence of impairment as a result of this test  we determine the amount of the impairment loss by the extent to which the carrying value of the impaired assets exceed their fair values as determined by valuation techniques including  as appropriate  the use of discounted cash flows to measure estimated fair value 
the long lived asset impairment test uses significant assumptions  estimates and judgments  and is subject to inherent uncertainties and subjectivity 
estimating projected cash flows associated with our asset groups involves 
table of contents the use of significant assumptions  estimates and judgments with respect to numerous factors  including future sales  gross profit  selling  general and administrative expense rates  and cash flows 
the use of different assumptions  estimates or judgments  such as the estimated future undiscounted cash flows  could significantly increase or decrease the related impairment test results 
goodwill and other intangible assets under goodwill accounting rules  we are required to assess goodwill for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
the analysis of potential impairment of goodwill employs a two step process 
the first step involves the estimation of fair value of our reporting units 
if step one indicates that impairment of goodwill potentially exists  the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment  if any 
goodwill impairment exists when the estimated implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment test as of december   with no indication of potential impairment 
our test indicated that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with recorded goodwill as of december  was significantly in excess of its related carrying value  with no such reporting unit having an excess of fair value less than of its carrying value 
our reporting unit with the least excess is our trc military reporting unit within our other reportable segment  and reported an excess of 
as stated below  the use of different assumptions  estimates or judgments in the goodwill impairment testing process may significantly increase or decrease the estimated fair value of a reporting unit 
however  as of the december  annual impairment test date  the above noted conclusion  that no indication of goodwill impairment existed as of the test date  would not have changed had the test been conducted assuming a decrease in the aggregate estimated undiscounted cash flows of our reporting units without any change in the discount rate  a basis point increase in the discount rate used to discount the aggregate estimated cash flows of our reporting units to their net present value in determining their estimated fair values without any change in the aggregate estimated cash flows of our reporting units  or decrease in the estimated sales growth rate without a change in the discount rate of each reporting unit 
goodwill impairment charges may be recognized in future periods to the extent changes in factors or circumstances occur  including deterioration in the macro economic environment or in the equity markets  including the market value of our common shares  deterioration in our performance or our future projections  or changes in our plans for one or more reporting units 
the goodwill impairment testing process involves the use of significant assumptions  estimates and judgments  and is subject to inherent uncertainties and subjectivity 
estimating a reporting unit s projected cash flows involves the use of significant assumptions  estimates and judgments with respect to numerous factors  including future sales  gross profit  selling  general and administrative expense rates  capital expenditures  and cash flows 
these estimates are based on our business plans and forecasts 
these estimates are then discounted  which necessitates the selection of an appropriate discount rate 
the discount rates used reflect market based estimates of the risks associated with the projected cash flows of the reporting unit 
we test the carrying amount of our finite lived intangible assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
this assessment employs a two step approach 
the first step is used to determine if a potential impairment exists while the second step measures the associated impairment loss if any 
an impairment loss is recognized if  in performing the impairment review  it is determined that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition 
the asset groups tested under our impairment tests reflect the shared nature of our facilities and manufacturing capacity 
the second step of the impairment tests involves measuring the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded 
the amount of the impairment loss recorded is equal to the excess of the asset or asset group s carrying value over its fair value 
for and  no asset impairments were identified relative 
table of contents to either our long lived property  plant and equipment or our finite lived intangible assets  other than among assets held for sale 
the long lived asset impairment test uses significant assumptions  estimates and judgments  and is subject to inherent uncertainties and subjectivity 
estimating projected cash flows associated with our asset groups involved the use of significant assumptions  estimates and judgments with respect to numerous factors  including future sales  gross profit  selling  general and administrative expense rates  discount rates and cash flows 
income taxes we use the asset and liability approach in accounting for income taxes 
under this approach  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates 
a provision for income tax expense is recognized for income taxes payable for the current period  plus the net changes in deferred tax amounts adjusted for other comprehensive income 
we periodically assess the realizability of deferred tax assets and the adequacy of deferred tax liabilities  including the results of local  state or federal tax audits

asu no 
affects all entities that have recognized goodwill and have one or more reporting units whose carrying amount for purposes of performing step of the goodwill impairment test is zero or negative 
the amendments in this update modify step so that for those reporting units  an entity is required to perform step of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
in determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists  an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist 
the qualitative factors are consistent with existing guidance  which requires that goodwill of a reporting unit be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
the accounting update was effective for a reporting entity s first annual reporting period that begins after december  for interim periods within that first annual reporting period and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter

asu no 
amends existing guidance by permitting an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test described in asc the more likely than not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than percent 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary 
asu no
