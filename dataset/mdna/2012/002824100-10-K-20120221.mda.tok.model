item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial review abbott s revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under short term receivable arrangements 
patent protection and licenses  technological and performance features  and inclusion of abbott s products under a contract or by a pharmacy benefit manager most impact which products are sold  price controls  competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products  and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales and costs 
abbott s primary products are prescription pharmaceuticals  nutritional products  diagnostic testing products and vascular products 
sales in international markets are approximately percent of consolidated net sales 
in  abbott announced a plan to separate into two publicly traded companies  one in diversified medical products and the other in research based pharmaceuticals 
to accomplish the separation  abbott plans to create a new company for its research based pharmaceuticals business which will include abbott s proprietary pharmaceutical products segment 
the transaction is expected to take the form of a tax free distribution to abbott shareholders of the stock of the newly created research based pharmaceutical company and is expected to be completed by the end of subsequent to the separation  the historical results of the research based pharmaceuticals business will be presented as discontinued operations 
continued robust growth of humira in a broad range of indications  the acquisitions of solvay s pharmaceuticals business solvay pharmaceuticals and piramal healthcare limited s healthcare solutions business  continued growth and market penetration by the xience drug eluting stent franchise  the loss of patent protection for some pharmaceutical products  an ongoing government investigation of abbott s sales and marketing activities related to depakote  and the challenging economic environment in many countries around the world have impacted abbott s sales  costs and financial position over the last three years 
pharmaceutical research and development is focused on therapeutic areas that include immunology  oncology  neuroscience  pain management  hepatitis c hcv  chronic kidney disease and women s health 
during the last three years  abbott acquired the rights to various in process pharmaceutical research and development projects including the development of second generation oral antioxidant inflammation modulators and a product for the treatment of chronic kidney disease 
in  abbott began the worldwide launch of humira for rheumatoid arthritis  followed by launches for five additional indications  which increased humira s worldwide sales to billion in compared to billion in  and billion in abbott forecasts low double digit growth for worldwide humira sales in abbott is studying additional indications for humira 
substantial research and development and selling support has been and continues to be dedicated to maximizing the worldwide potential of humira 
abbott expects generic competition for tricor to begin in the second half of austerity measures implemented by several european countries reduced healthcare spending and affected pharmaceutical pricing in and the healthcare reform legislation in the us resulted in rebate changes beginning in and the payment of an annual fee beginning in  which negatively affected abbott s pharmaceutical business 
the impact of the austerity measures and the us healthcare reform legislation is expected to continue 
in february  abbott acquired solvay pharmaceuticals which provided abbott with a large and complementary portfolio of pharmaceutical products and expanded abbott s presence in key global emerging markets 
the acquisition added approximately billion to abbott s total sales  primarily outside the us in september  abbott completed the acquisition of piramal s healthcare solutions business  propelling abbott to market leadership in the indian pharmaceutical market and further accelerating the company s growth in emerging markets 
in and  abbott recorded approximately million and million  respectively  of expense related to the integration of the solvay business and 
table of contents a restructuring plan announced in september to streamline operations  improve efficiencies and reduce costs primarily in certain solvay sites and functions 
the restructuring plan is further described below 
in  abbott recorded a litigation charge of billion related to ongoing settlement discussions in the us government s investigation related to depakote 
in abbott s worldwide nutritional products business  favorable economic development in emerging markets and an aging population in developed markets have provided significant opportunities to leverage strong nutritional brands and introduce innovative products 
in the fourth quarter of  abbott s xience v product became the market leading drug eluting stent in the us in june  xience prime  abbott s next generation drug eluting stent  received ce mark approval and was launched in europe in august abbott received approval to market xience v in japan in january and xience v became the market leading drug eluting stent in japan in the second quarter of with the us launches of xience nano and xience prime in may and november  respectively  and continued strong performance in japan  china  and other international markets  xience  which includes xience v  prime and nano  ended as the market leading drug eluting stent globally 
at the same time the third party distributor of the promus product began transitioning away from the product and that distribution agreement will end in in  the us government passed health care reform legislation which included an increase in medicaid rebate rates and the extension of the rebate to drugs provided through medicaid managed care organizations beginning in the legislation also imposed annual fees which pharmaceutical manufacturers began paying in and medical device companies will begin paying in  as well as additional rebates related to the medicare part d donut hole beginning in in addition to a one time charge of approximately million to reduce deferred tax assets associated with retiree health care liabilities related to the medicare part d retiree drug subsidy  the legislation s negative impact on abbott s performance grew from more than million in to approximately million in and is expected to remain at approximately million in abbott s short and long term debt totaled billion at december   largely incurred to finance acquisitions 
operating cash flows in excess of capital expenditures and cash dividends have partially funded acquisitions over the last three years 
at december   abbott s long term debt rating was aa by standard and poor s corporation and a by moody s investors service 
in  abbott will focus on several key initiatives 
in the proprietary pharmaceutical business  abbott will continue maximizing the market potential for humira and other products  including androgel  as well as continuing to build its global presence 
pharmaceutical research and development efforts will continue to focus a significant portion of expenditures on compounds for immunology  oncology  neuroscience  pain management  hcv  chronic kidney disease and women s health 
current research and development projects are described in the research and development programs section 
in the established pharmaceutical business which includes international sales of branded generic products  abbott will continue to focus on obtaining additional product approvals across numerous countries and expanding its presence in emerging markets 
in the vascular business  abbott will continue to focus on marketing products in the xience franchise  obtaining regulatory review of the mitraclip device in the us  and increasing international mitraclip sales as well as further clinical development of absorb  its bioresorbable vascular scaffold bvs device and a further roll out of absorb in ce mark countries 
in abbott s other segments  abbott will focus on developing or acquiring differentiated technologies in higher growth segments of those markets 
critical accounting policies sales rebates approximately percent of abbott s consolidated gross revenues are subject to various forms of rebates and allowances that abbott records as reductions of revenues at the time of sale 

table of contents most of these rebates and allowances are in the proprietary pharmaceutical products segment and the nutritional products segment 
abbott provides rebates to pharmacy benefit management companies  state agencies that administer the federal medicaid program  insurance companies that administer medicare drug plans  state agencies that administer the special supplemental nutrition program for women  infants  and children wic  wholesalers  group purchasing organizations  and other government agencies and private entities 
rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices for a product 
factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of which products have been sold subject to a rebate  which customer or government agency price terms apply  and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of a rebate 
using historical trends  adjusted for current changes  abbott estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid  and records the liability as a reduction of gross sales when abbott records its sale of the product 
settlement of the rebate generally occurs from two to months after sale 
abbott regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs 
rebates and chargebacks charged against gross sales in  and amounted to approximately billion  billion and billion  respectively  or percent  percent and percent  respectively  based on gross sales of approximately billion  billion and billion  respectively  subject to rebate 
a one percentage point increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales would decrease net sales by approximately million in abbott considers a one percentage point increase to be a reasonably likely increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales 
other allowances charged against gross sales were approximately million  million and million for cash discounts in  and  respectively  and million  million and million for returns in  and  respectively 
cash discounts are known within to days of sale  and therefore can be reliably estimated 
returns can be reliably estimated because abbott s historical returns are low  and because sales returns terms and other sales terms have remained relatively unchanged for several periods 
management analyzes the adequacy of ending rebate accrual balances each quarter 
in the domestic nutritional business  management uses both internal and external data available to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel 
management has access to several large customers inventory management data  and for other customers  utilizes data from a third party that measures time on the retail shelf 
these sources allow management to make reliable estimates of inventory in the distribution channel 
except for a transition period before or after a change in the supplier for the wic business in a state  inventory in the distribution channel does not vary substantially 
management also estimates the states processing lag time based on claims data 
in addition  internal processing time is a factor in estimating the accrual 
in the wic business  the state where the sale is made  which is the determining factor for the applicable price  is reliably determinable 
estimates are required for the amount of wic sales within each state where abbott has the wic business 
external data sources utilized for that estimate are participant data from the us department of agriculture usda  which administers the wic program  participant data from some of the states  and internally administered market research 
the usda has been making its data available for many years 
internal data includes historical redemption rates and pricing data 
at december   abbott had the exclusive wic business in states 
in the domestic proprietary pharmaceutical business  the most significant charges against gross sales are for medicaid and medicare rebates  pharmacy benefit manager rebates and wholesaler chargebacks 
in order to evaluate the adequacy of the ending accrual balances  management uses both internal and external data to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel and the rebate claims processing lag time 
external data sources used to estimate the inventory in the distribution channel include inventory levels periodically reported by wholesalers and third party market data purchased by abbott 
management estimates the processing lag time based on periodic sampling of claims data 
to estimate the price rebate percentage  systems and calculations are used to track sales by product by customer and to estimate the contractual or statutory price 
abbott s systems and calculations have developed over time as rebates have become more significant  and abbott believes they are reliable 

table of contents the following table is an analysis of the four largest rebate accruals  which comprise approximately percent of the consolidated rebate provisions charged against revenues in remaining rebate provisions charged against gross sales are not significant in the determination of operating earnings 
dollars in millions domestic proprietary pharmaceutical products domestic nutritionals wic rebates medicaid and medicare rebates pharmacy benefit manager rebates wholesaler chargebacks balance at january  provisions payments balance at december  provisions payments balance at december  provisions payments balance at december  historically  adjustments to prior years rebate accruals have not been material to net income 
abbott employs various techniques to verify the accuracy of claims submitted to it  and where possible  works with the organizations submitting claims to gain insight into changes that might affect the rebate amounts 
for medicaid  medicare and other government agency programs  the calculation of a rebate involves interpretations of relevant regulations  which are subject to challenge or change in interpretation 
income taxes abbott operates in numerous countries where its income tax returns are subject to audits and adjustments 
because abbott operates globally  the nature of the audit items are often very complex  and the objectives of the government auditors can result in a tax on the same income in more than one country 
abbott employs internal and external tax professionals to minimize audit adjustment amounts where possible 
in accordance with the accounting rules relating to the measurement of tax contingencies  in order to recognize an uncertain tax benefit  the taxpayer must be more likely than not of sustaining the position  and the measurement of the benefit is calculated as the largest amount that is more than percent likely to be realized upon resolution of the benefit 
application of these rules requires a significant amount of judgment 
in the us  abbott s federal income tax returns through are settled except for one item  and the income tax returns for years after are open 
abbott does not record deferred income taxes on earnings reinvested indefinitely in foreign subsidiaries 
pension and post employment benefits abbott offers pension benefits and post employment health care to many of its employees 
abbott engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under these programs 
abbott must develop long term assumptions  the most significant of which are the health care cost trend rates  discount rates and the expected return on plan assets 
the discount rates used to measure liabilities were determined based on high quality fixed income securities that match the duration of the expected retiree benefits 
the health care cost trend rates represent abbott s expected annual rates of change in the cost of health care benefits and is a forward projection of health care costs as of the measurement date 
a difference between the assumed rates and the actual rates  which will not be known for decades  can be significant in relation to the obligations and the annual cost recorded for these programs 
low asset returns due to poor market conditions and low interest rates have significantly increased actuarial losses for these plans 
at december   pretax net actuarial losses and prior service costs and credits recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for abbott s defined benefit plans and medical and dental plans were losses of billion and million  respectively 
actuarial losses and gains are amortized over the remaining service 
table of contents attribution periods of the employees under the corridor method  in accordance with the rules for accounting for post employment benefits 
differences between the expected long term return on plan assets and the actual annual return are amortized over a five year period 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the impact of a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate  however  there can be no certainty that a change would be limited to only one percentage point 
valuation of intangible assets abbott has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that abbott records at fair value 
transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the health care field and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
the discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows  risk  the cost of capital  terminal values and market participants 
each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset 
abbott engages independent valuation experts who review abbott s critical assumptions and calculations for acquisitions of significant intangibles 
abbott reviews definite lived intangible assets for impairment each quarter using an undiscounted net cash flows approach 
if the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset  the intangible asset is written down to its fair value  which is usually the discounted cash flow amount 
where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset  the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  which relate to in process research and development acquired in a business combination  are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in an impairment occurs 
at december   goodwill and intangibles amounted to billion and billion  respectively  and amortization expense for intangible assets amounted to billion in there were no impairments of goodwill in  or in  abbott recorded impairment charges of million for certain research and development assets due to changes in the projected development and regulatory timelines for the projects 
litigation abbott accounts for litigation losses in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification no 
 contingencies 
under asc no 
 loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management s best estimate of a loss  or when a best estimate cannot be made  a minimum loss contingency amount is recorded 
these estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known  and the estimates are refined each accounting period as additional information becomes known 
accordingly  abbott is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss  and therefore the minimum amount  which could be zero  is recorded 
as information becomes known  either the minimum loss amount is increased  resulting in additional loss provisions  or a best estimate can be made  also resulting in additional loss provisions 
occasionally  a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected 
abbott estimates the range of possible loss to be from approximately billion to billion for its legal proceedings and environmental exposures 
reserves of approximately billion have been recorded at december  for these proceedings and exposures 
these reserves represent management s best estimate of probable loss  as defined by fasb asc no

change in accounting principle and other income expense  net prior to january   the accounts of foreign subsidiaries were consolidated based on a fiscal year ended november due to the time needed to consolidate these subsidiaries 
effective january   the one month lag in the consolidation of the accounts of foreign subsidiaries was eliminated and the 
table of contents year end of foreign subsidiaries was changed to december abbott believes that the change in accounting principle related to the elimination of the one month reporting lag is preferable because it will result in more contemporaneous reporting of the results of foreign subsidiaries 
in accordance with applicable accounting literature  a change in subsidiaries year end is treated as a change in accounting principle and requires retrospective application 
the cumulative effect of the change was an increase in retained earnings of million as of january  and a corresponding decrease in other long term liabilities 
the impact of the change was not material to the results of operations for the previously reported annual and interim periods after january   and thus  those results have not been revised

taxes on earnings the income tax rates on earnings were percent in  percent in and percent in taxes on earnings in reflect the effect of the tax rate applied to a litigation reserve and the recognition of million of tax benefits as a result of the favorable resolution of various tax positions pertaining to prior years  which also decreased the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits by approximately billion 
exclusive of these discrete items  the effective rates are lower than the us federal statutory rate of percent due primarily to the benefit of lower foreign tax rates and tax exemptions that reduced the tax rates by   and percentage points in  and  respectively 
the tax rate reductions are primarily derived from operations in puerto rico  switzerland  ireland and singapore where abbott benefits from a combination of favorable statutory tax rules  tax rulings  grants  and exemptions 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a full reconciliation of the effective tax rate to the us federal statutory rate 
as a result of the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act which were signed into law in  abbott recorded a charge of approximately million in to reduce deferred tax assets associated with retiree health care liabilities related to the medicare part d retiree drug subsidy

this excise tax is recorded in cost of products sold although the tax is creditable for us income tax purposes 

table of contents research and development programs abbott currently has numerous pharmaceutical  medical and nutritional products in development 
research and development process in the proprietary pharmaceuticals segment  the research and development process generally begins with discovery research which focuses on the identification of a molecule that has a desired effect against a given disease 
if preclinical testing of an identified compound proves successful  the compound moves into clinical development which generally includes the following phases phase i involves the first human tests in a small number of healthy volunteers to assess tolerability and potential dosing 
phase ii tests the molecule s efficacy against the disease in a small group of patients 
phase iii tests a molecule that demonstrates favorable results in the earlier phases in a significantly larger patient population to further demonstrate efficacy and safety based on regulatory criteria 
the clinical trials from all of the development phases provide the data required to prepare and submit a new drug application nda  a biological license application bla or other submission for regulatory approval to the us food and drug administration fda or similar government agencies outside the us the specific requirements eg  scope of clinical trials for obtaining regulatory approval vary across different countries and geographic regions 
the research and development process from discovery through a new drug launch typically takes years and can be even longer 
there is a significant amount of uncertainty inherent in the research and development of new pharmaceutical products and there is no guarantee when  or if  a molecule will receive the regulatory approval required to launch a new drug or indication 
in addition to the development of new products and new formulations  proprietary pharmaceutical research and development projects also may include phase iv trials  sometimes called post marketing studies 
for such projects  clinical trials are designed and conducted to collect additional data regarding  among other parameters  the benefits and risks of an approved drug 
in the established pharmaceuticals segment  the research and development process focuses on the geographic expansion and continuous improvement of the segment s existing products to provide improved therapeutic benefits itbs to patients and customers 
as established pharmaceuticals does not actively pursue primary research  development usually begins with work on existing products or after the acquisition of an advanced stage licensing opportunity 
depending upon the product  the phases of development may include drug product development phase i bioequivalence studies to compare a future established pharmaceutical s brand with an already marketed compound with the same active pharmaceutical ingredient api 
phase ii studies to test the efficacy of an itb in a small group of patients 
phase iii studies to broaden the testing to a wider population that reflects the actual medical use 
the specific requirements eg scope of clinical trials for obtaining regulatory approval vary across different countries and geographic regions 
the process may range from one year for a bioequivalence study project to or more years for complex formulations and new indications 
in addition to the development of new itbs  development projects may also include phase iv studies similar to the post marketing studies described above for proprietary pharmaceuticals 

table of contents in the diagnostics segment  the phases of the research and development process include discovery which focuses on identification of a product that will address a specific therapeutic area  platform  or unmet clinical need  concept feasibility during which the materials and manufacturing processes are evaluated  testing may include product characterization and analysis is performed to confirm clinical utility  and development during which extensive testing is performed to demonstrate that the product meets specified design requirements and that the design specifications conform to user needs and intended uses 
as with pharmaceutical products  the regulatory requirements for diagnostic products vary across different countries and geographic regions 
in the us  the fda classifies diagnostic products into classes i  ii  or iii and the classification determines the regulatory process for approval 
while the diagnostics segment has products in all three classes  the vast majority of its products are categorized as class i or class ii 
submission of a separate regulatory filing is not required for class i products 
class ii devices typically require pre market notification to the fda through a regulatory filing known as a k submission 
most class iii products are subject to the fda s pre marketing approval pma requirements 
other class iii products  such as those used to screen blood  require the submission and approval of a bla 
in the eu  diagnostic products are also categorized into different categories and the regulatory process  which is governed by the european in vitro diagnostic medical device directive  depends upon the category 
certain product categories require review and approval by an independent company  known as a notified body  before the manufacturer can affix a ce mark to the product to show compliance with the directive 
other products only require a self certification process 
in the vascular segment  the research and development process begins with research on a specific technology that is evaluated for feasibility and commercial viability 
if the research program passes that hurdle  it moves forward into development 
the development process includes evaluation and selection of a product design  completion of clinical trials to test the product s safety and efficacy  and validation of the manufacturing process to demonstrate its repeatability and ability to consistently meet pre determined specifications 
similar to the diagnostic products discussed above  in the us  vascular products are classified as class i  ii  or iii 
most of abbott s vascular products are classified as class ii devices that follow the k regulatory process or class iii devices that are subject to the pma process 
in the eu  vascular products are also categorized into different classes and the regulatory process  which is governed by the european medical device directive  varies by class 
each product must bear a ce mark to show compliance with the directive 
some products require submission of a design dossier to the appropriate regulatory authority for review and approval prior to ce marking of the device 
for other products  the company is required to prepare a technical file which includes testing results and clinical evaluations but can self certify its ability to apply the ce mark to the product 
outside the us and the eu  the regulatory requirements vary across different countries and regions 
after approval and commercial launch of some vascular products  post market trials may be conducted either due to a conditional requirement of the regulatory market approval or with the objective of proving product superiority 
in the nutritional segment  the research and development process generally focuses on identifying and developing ingredients and products that address the nutritional needs of particular populations eg  infants  athletes or patients eg  people with diabetes 
depending upon the country and or region  if claims regarding a product s efficacy will be made  clinical studies typically must be conducted 
most 
table of contents other product development  such as a product form change from liquid to powder  generally does not necessitate clinical studies 
in the us  the fda requires that it be notified of proposed new formulations and formulation or packaging changes related to infant formula products 
prior to the launch of an infant formula or product packaging change  the company is required to obtain the fda s confirmation that it has no objections to the proposed product or packaging 
for other nutrition products  notification or pre approval from the fda is not required unless the product includes a new food additive 
in some countries  regulatory approval may be required for certain nutritional products  including infant formula and medical nutritional products

development is also continuing on an updated hospital blood glucose monitoring system for which filings for approval are projected to be submitted in the us and europe during the first half of abbott is also developing a next generation monitoring system under the precision product platform 
abbott anticipates submitting filings for approval in various markets in nutrition abbott is focusing its research and development spend on six benefit platforms that span the pediatric  adult and performance nutrition areas immunity  cognition  lean body mass  inflammation  metabolism and tolerance 
numerous new products that build on advances in these benefit platforms are currently under development and are expected to be launched in given the diversity of abbott s business  its intention to remain a broad based healthcare company and the numerous sources for potential future growth  no individual project is expected to be material to cash flows or results of operations over the next five years 
factors considered included research and development expenses projected to be incurred for the project compound or device over the next year relative to abbott s total research and development expenses as well as qualitative factors  such as marketplace perceptions and impact of a new product on abbott s overall market position 
there were no delays in abbott s research and development activities that are expected to have a material impact on operations 
while the aggregate cost to complete the numerous pharmaceutical and medical device projects currently in development is expected to be material  the total cost to complete will depend upon abbott s ability to successfully complete each project  the rate at which each project advances  and the ultimate timing for completion 
given the potential for significant delays and the high rate of failure inherent in the research and development of new pharmaceutical and medical device products and technologies  it is not possible to accurately estimate the total cost to complete all projects currently in development 
however  abbott plans to continue to manage its portfolio of projects to achieve research and development spend equal to approximately percent to percent of sales each year 
abbott does not regularly accumulate or make management decisions based on the total expenses incurred for a particular development phase in a given period 
generally  abbott seeks to obtain various forms of exclusivity for each product in development 
abbott obtains patent protection  where available  in all significant markets and or countries for each product in development 
additionally  abbott also seeks to obtain other forms of legal or regulatory 
table of contents exclusivity that would protect the product upon approval 
these forms of regulatory exclusivity have a variety of terms  from  to years in the united states  and up to years in the european union 
this regulatory exclusivity is granted upon the approval of each development project 
in certain instances  regulatory exclusivity may protect a product where patent protection is no longer available or for a period of time in excess of patent protection 
the availability of and length of such regulatory exclusivity is based  in part  on the length of the regulatory review process and can only be determined upon product approval 
it is not possible to estimate for each product in development the total period of exclusivity that will be obtained if regulatory approval is obtained 
generally  upon approval  products in development may be entitled to exclusivity 
abbott seeks patent protection  where available  in all significant markets and or countries for each product in development 
in the united states  the expiration date for patents filed on or after june  is years after the filing date 
given that patents relating to pharmaceutical products are often obtained early in the development process and given the amount of time needed to complete clinical trials and other development activities required for regulatory approval  the length of time between product launch and patent expiration may be significantly less than years if a product in development ultimately obtains regulatory approval 
the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of commonly known as the hatch waxman act permits a patent holder to seek a patent extension commonly called a patent term restoration for patents on products or processes for making the product regulated by the federal food  drug and cosmetic act 
the calculation of the patent extension is roughly based on percent of the period of time extending from the filing of an investigational new drug application to the submission of the nda  plus percent of the time period from nda submission to regulatory approval 
the extension  however  cannot exceed years and the remaining patent term after regulatory approval cannot exceed years 
only one patent related to the first commercial marketing of a newly approved pharmaceutical product is eligible for a patent term restoration 
additionally  products may be entitled to obtain other forms of legal or regulatory exclusivity upon approval 
these forms of regulatory exclusivity have a variety of terms in the united states and are variable in other jurisdictions 
in the united states  when the fda approves a new chemical entity that it has not previously approved alone or in combination with other chemical entities  the product is granted years of regulatory exclusivity 
the fda may grant years of market exclusivity for an nda  including supplementary applications  if the application contains reports of new clinical investigations that have not previously been relied upon by the fda 
if the fda grants pediatric exclusivity  the longest existing exclusivity patent or regulatory related to the product would be extended by months 
if the fda designates a product as an orphan drug that is either used to treat conditions that afflict a relatively small population or for which there is not a reasonable expectation that the research and development costs will be recovered  the fda may grant years of exclusivity 
this regulatory exclusivity is granted upon the approval of each development project 
in certain instances  regulatory exclusivity may protect a product where patent protection is no longer available or for a period of time in excess of patent protection 
it is not possible to estimate for each product in development the total period of exclusivity that will be obtained if regulatory approval is obtained 
however  given the length of time required to complete clinical development of a pharmaceutical product  the minimum and maximum periods of exclusivity that might be achieved in any individual case would not be expected to exceed and years  respectively 
these estimates do not consider other factors  such as the difficulty of recreating the manufacturing process for a particular product or other proprietary knowledge that may provide some level of additional protection against generic incursion

the results of the last impairment test indicated that the fair value of each reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value except for the medical optics unit 
while the fair value of the medical optics business exceeds its carrying value  extended economic pressure on government reimbursed cataract procedures in europe and on the global lasik surgery business as well as longer regulatory approval timelines for products currently under development could result in a valuation in the future where the fair value of the medical optics unit has declined below its carrying value  thereby triggering the requirement to estimate the implied fair value of the goodwill and measure for impairment
