table of contents mineral property acquisition costs the company capitalizes the cost of acquiring mineral properties and will amortize these costs over the useful life of a property following the commencement of production or expense these costs if it is determined that the mineral property has no future economic value or the properties are sold or abandoned 
costs include cash consideration and the fair market value of shares issued on the acquisition of mineral properties 
properties acquired under option agreements  whereby payments are made at the sole discretion of the company  are recorded in the accounts of the specific mineral property at the time the payments are made 
the amounts recorded as mineral properties reflect actual costs incurred to acquire the properties and do not indicate any present or future value of economically recoverable reserves 
exploration expenses the company records exploration expenses as incurred 
when it is determined that precious metal resource deposit can be economically and legally extracted or produced based on established proven and probable reserves  further exploration expenses related to such reserves incurred after such a determination will be capitalized

derivatives the company has adopted the amended provisions of asc on determining what types of instruments or embedded features in an instrument held by a reporting entity can be considered indexed to its own stock

warrants that are issued with exercise prices other than the company s functional currency of the us dollar are accounted for as liabilities 
the fair value of the company s outstanding warrant liabilities is determined at each reporting date with any change to the liability from a previous period recorded in the statement of operations 
we record changes in the fair value of our warrant liabilities as a component of other income and expense as we believe the amounts recorded relate to financing activities and not as a result of our operations 
if a stock purchase warrant is exercised the company is only obligated to issue shares in its common stock 
if the company were to issue stock purchase warrants with exercise prices in its functional currency  the warrants would be considered indexed to our stock and the fair value at date of issue recorded as equity 
there would be no requirement under us gaap to report changes in its fair value from period to period
