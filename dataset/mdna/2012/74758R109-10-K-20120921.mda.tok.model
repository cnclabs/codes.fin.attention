part i item business introduction qualstar is a leading provider of high efficiency and high density power supplies marketed under the npower brand  and of data storage systems marketed under the qualstar brand 
our npower power supply products provide compact and efficient power conversion for a wide variety of industries and applications including  but not limited to telecom  networking  broadcast  industrial  lighting  gaming and test equipment 
our qualstar data storage products are used to provide highly scalable and reliable solutions to store and retrieve very large quantities of electronic data 
in we acquired npower  which we established as a separate division from the qualstar storage business to better address the distinct market segments that each division serves 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements under part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
the npower division provides both high efficiency and high density ac dc and dc dc power supplies for a variety of applications  including data center technologies such as switches  routers  data storage  servers and networking communications equipment 
we also design and manufacture power solutions for the telecommunications industry employing both conventional ac dc systems and dc dc systems 
with a wide variety of standard products and the ability to create custom and semi custom products  we offer a very comprehensive product line to oems that require high value  high efficiency  power supplies to meet individual needs 
the n brand is one of the industry leaders in delivering high power density high efficiency ratios 
the storage division provides high quality and highly reliable data protection and archive storage systems which are used to record  retrieve and manage electronic data  primarily in networked computing environments 
our storage products integrate with all operating systems including windows  linux and unix  and are compatible with a wide range of storage management software solutions such as those offered by ibm  emc  commvault and symantec 
we offer products spanning the storage needs of the small and medium size business market to the enterprise market 
in addition to storage products the storage division offers comprehensive worldwide service and support programs that enable customers to keep our products running in environments where the ability to constantly access data is vital 
we design our products at our locations in california and colorado  and we sell our products globally through authorized resellers and oems 
our npower division utilizes contract manufacturers in asia to produce our power supply products  while our storage division products are manufactured by our own in house workforce at our factory in california 
our research  development and engineering organization is located in simi valley  california and boulder  colorado 
we employ more than engineers 
qualstar was incorporated in california in power supply industry background the power conversion markets are comprised of a few large suppliers and a number of smaller companies that focus on specialized products 
the power conversion market  which includes the servers  storage and network ssn  industrial and transportation ind and network power systems nps markets among others are expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate from to according to ims research 
in  power conversion products were negatively influenced by macroeconomic conditions throughout the globe  with industry sales declining versus  according to market studies 
longer term  we believe the following key trends will continue to drive demand for power conversion products increasing amounts of power required by the communications infrastructure industry 
the proliferation of data centers and their related infrastructures  the internet  wireless communications  broadband applications  server and storage farms and other new technologies  have increased exponentially the amount of information transmitted over the recent past 
as a result  the push for higher bandwidth and more efficient and effective systems has been driving a faster replacement cycle for telecommunications equipment as well as strong infrastructure expansion 
increasing demand for high conversion efficiencies  high power density and digital power management 
recent efforts in the eu  the united states and asia to reduce energy consumption are increasing the demand for high conversion efficiencies and digital power control 
in addition  groups such as the climate savers computing initiative  consisting of a consortium of companies including google and intel and other eco conscious businesses and conservation organizations are promoting the development  deployment and adoption of smart technologies that can both improve the efficiency of a computer s power utilization and reduce the energy consumed when the computer is in an inactive state 
because a large portion of electrical energy waste occurs during the power conversion process  power supply companies have an opportunity to improve the conversion efficiency to reduce the operating costs for the end user 
our ac dc power supplies have led the markets we serve with conversion efficiency ratings up to 
our digital power control technologies allow us to achieve high levels of power conversion efficiency and control that are not possible with analog designs 
higher conversion efficiencies help reduce overall power usage and therefore cut greenhouse gas emissions and total cost of infrastructure ownership 
strategy our primary objective in our power supply business is to be a global leader in high efficiency  high density power conversion for the data center  communications equipment  and industrial and telecommunications network power markets 
to achieve this objective we plan to continue to expand our sales channels and geographies 
we have begun to promote the npower brand on a global basis and are targeting larger oems  and distributers who have a presence in markets and geographies that we do not currently serve 
continue to drive deeper penetration in our current oem customers 
our original equipment manufacturer oem customers are constantly changing their products and introducing new products 
we are driving to become the supplier of choice within our oem customer base to leverage our existing relationships and drive volume growth within the same sales channel 
continue to expand our footprint in the data center equipment and communications markets 
our products are very well suited for the data center equipment  networking and communications systems markets 
we have secured several sizable oem customers in these markets and are driving deeper penetration within our current customer base as well as adding new customers in these markets 
increase our engineering resources to address our oem customers custom product requests 
our oem customers consistently request that our engineering team augment theirs by designing custom power supplies specific to their product requirements 
while to date we have had limited resources to apply to these revenue opportunities  we intend to provide our engineering team with additional resources to address these market and customer requirements 
expand our standard product offerings while continuing to drive for higher power levels and greater conversion efficiencies in a smaller footprint 
real estate within our customers products is precious  and as a result there is a continuing need for smaller packaging and space reduction while delivering additional power 
our product roadmap addresses these needs and our objective is to lead the industry with the greatest efficiency in the smallest footprint with the highest power available 
in this way  we can deliver advantages to our oem customers as they leverage our technology in their product designs 
organize our technology resources for fast time to market on derivative products 
our customers continually request derivative configurations to our existing products 
in order to serve this market effectively  we are organizing our engineering resources for fast turnaround on these designs to shorten our oem customer s design cycle  leading to faster time to market 
our power supply products we design  develop  manufacture and market our power supply products  which are designed to convert  regulate  purify  manage or distribute electrical power for electronic equipment 
our products generally convert ac current from the grid to dc current for use in computer based products  or modify the voltage being delivered dc to dc 
we specifically target markets where high efficiency and power density are important to our customers 
we sell standard  modified standard and custom designed products 
standard products are sold unmodified to our customers 
modified standard products are based on lightly modified versions of standard products 
custom products are designed specifically to the customer s specification and are not generally sold to others 
custom products may require non recurring engineering and tooling costs to bring the product to production 
our products can be classified into the following principal groups ac dc power supplies 
our compact ac dc power supplies convert ac input voltages ranging from vac to vac into precisely controlled dc output voltages  while achieving efficiencies of up to 
the power supplies utilize unique integrated circuits ics to control the operation of the supply and provide operating protections  including over power protection opp  over current protection ocp  over temperature protection otp  and over voltage protection ovp 
constant voltage outputs range from vdc to vdc  and are available in single and multi output versions 
constant current versions of the ac dc power supplies are available with output voltages of        or vdc  and are typically used in the light emitting diode led lighting industry 
convection cooled versions of the power supplies provide efficient operation in the absence of forced air cooling 
the power supplies may be configured to share current between multiple power supplies  allowing for n and n redundancy installations 
an optional pmbustm digital communications interface is also available to allow up to four model xl power supplies to communicate over the same bus for remote control of the main outputs and the v fans 
dc dc power supplies 
the dc dc power supplies modify vdc or vdc input voltages into a variety of dc output voltages  while achieving efficiencies greater than 
as in our ac dc power supplies  the dc dc models utilize unique ics to control the operation of the supply and provide several methods of protection  including over power protection opp  over current protection ocp  over temperature protection otp  and over voltage protection ovp 
constant voltage outputs range from vdc to vdc  and are available in single and multi output versions 
data storage industry background the data protection and archival storage markets are comprised of a few large suppliers and a number of smaller companies that offer specialized products and capacity ranges 
the data protection and archive storage market  which includes disk based and tape library based systems and related software is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate from to according to idc 
in  the tape portion of the archival storage market was negatively influenced by a shift in it spending to performance storage in order to keep up with the explosion of data generation  as well as macroeconomic conditions throughout the globe 
the emphasis in it spending on higher end performance storage products contributed to lower sales for archive storage 
longer term  we believe the increasing amounts of storage required by the it universe will continue to drive demand for archive storage products 
the proliferation of e commerce  video streaming  digital media  and advanced software applications has driven growth in the production of electronic information to an exponential level from just a few years ago 
as a result  the information infrastructure has implemented many solutions addressing access speeds and higher capacity  but a growing need is building for data protection and archival storage 
as regulators and companies require the accumulation of and access to archived data  the market to store that data cost effectively continues to grow 
over the last few years it spending has been concentrated on the performance aspect of storage  and adding more additional cost effective capacity has lagged in the share of wallet 
we believe this performance spending trend is reversing somewhat and the need for additional data protection and archival capacity to house the files that are currently held on performance storage devices will be moved to make room for new files is fast approaching 
we believe this will drive future demand for tape libraries 
as customers constantly add to their ever growing disk based storage systems  the operating costs of those systems have become impossible to ignore 
tape libraries use less than th the power of a comparable sized disk system  making them the ideal storage technology for rarely accessed data 
we believe that this operating cost advantage will result in increased interest in tape library based storage systems 
strategy our primary objective in our storage business is to be a global leader in highly scalable  cost effective data protection and archival storage for the information technology markets 
to achieve this objective we plan to continue to expand our sales channels and geographies 
we have begun to accelerate the promotion of qualstar storage solutions on a global basis and will continue to add resellers outside the us in addition to adding new us resellers 
we are also exploring oem and private label opportunities to market our products 
produce expandable storage solutions that deliver scalability within the data center and more effective capital spending for our customers 
expandability is a key requirement for many customers who are dealing with rapidly growing capacity needs on a regular basis 
expandability enables them to easily and quickly add more storage while providing a cost effective solution that can be readily budgeted during their planning cycles 
explore adjacent technologies to expand our functionality and footprint in the it market 
historically we have been focused on products using magnetic tape as the media in our systems and on automating the loading  unloading and storage of the media 
we will explore use of other media such as hard disk drives hdd and solid state drives ssd  alone or in combination  in order to evaluate a wider product offering for the growing data storage market 
offer cost effective  service and support programs that enable our customers to keep their products running hours a day  days a week 
we have recently expanded our onsite service coverage beyond the us and western europe and can now offer this vital service in several asian countries 
we plan to continue this expansion to other markets as we identify appropriate service providers to engage with 
our storage products we design  develop  manufacture and market storage products which deliver cost effective data protection and archival storage to small and medium businesses smb  and to more complex small and medium enterprise environments with stringent performance and data availability requirements 
we provide a wide range of storage solutions that span capacities from terabytes to over petabytes terabytes petabyte which encompass over tape drives and more than  slots for tape media 
the rls and rls series expandable rack mount tape libraries deliver both high density to maximize rack space utilization and easy customer expandability to keep pace with exploding archive storage and data protection requirements 
rls base models house   or tape slots and up to lto format tape drives 
up to three customer installable expansion modules can be installed on every base unit using qualstar s unique fastpass elevator assembly to quickly and transparently move tapes between modules as needed 
each module adds more tape storage slots and additional tape drive slots 
rls configurations can scale capacity to over petabytes in a single inch rack 
advanced features including library enabled data encryption to protect the data on tapes in transit to remote locations  dual ac input power to allow operation to continue if one power source drops off line and q link  our widely regarded remote library manager 
qualstar s xls enterprise library system provides the widest range of capacity and performance available to enterprise class data protection and archive storage customers

research and development we incurred research and development costs of million each of fiscal and  and million in fiscal  representing  and of net revenue  respectively 
in fiscal  we continued to augment our product lines by expanding our hardware platforms and feature enhancements to our products 
noteworthy product releases for fiscal was the fastpass elevator assembly which adds scalability to the rls platform and data encryption key management for the xls series 
our plans for fiscal include a number of hardware and software enhancements across all of our storage products  and several new power supplies encompassing derivatives of existing modelsand new power sizes 
particular areas of focus are oriented toward product line streamlining and leveraging common componentry  as well as exploring oem opportunities in the storage side of the business 
manufacturing and suppliers we perform product assembly  integration and testing for our storage products at our factory in simi valley  california 
our npower products are manufactured in china at various contract manufacturers 
we purchase tape drives  chassis  printed circuit boards  integrated circuits  and all other major components from outside suppliers 
we carefully select suppliers based on their ability to provide quality parts and components which meet technical specifications and volume requirements 
we actively monitor these suppliers but we are subject to substantial risks associated with the performance of our suppliers 
for certain components  we qualify a single source  which magnifies the risk of shortages and decreases our ability to negotiate with that supplier 
see if our suppliers fail to meet our manufacturing needs  it would delay our production and our product shipments to customers and negatively affect our operations under the heading risk factors in part i  section a of this report 
competition the worldwide storage market is highly competitive 
competitors vary in size from small start ups to large multi national corporations which may have substantially greater financial  research and development and marketing resources than us 
in the tape automation market  we believe our primary competitors are international business machines corporation ibm  dell inc  overland storage  spectra logic and quantum corporation 
key competitive factors include product features  reliability  durability  scalability and price 
barriers to entry in tape automation are relatively high 
our primary power supply competitors are emerson  tdk lambda  xp power and power one 
key competitive factors in these markets include price  performance  functionality  availability  interoperability  connectivity  time to market  enhancements and total value of ownership 
barriers to entry for power supply products are high 
the markets for all of our products are characterized by significant price competition and we anticipate that our products will continue to face price pressure 
intellectual property we rely on copyright protection of our firmware  as well as patent protection for some of our designs and products 
we also rely on a combination of trademark  trade secret and other intellectual property laws to protect our proprietary rights 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  however  competition in our businesses is significant 
we believe that  because of the rapid pace of technological change in the tape storage and power supply industries  patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret protection are less significant than factors such as market responsiveness  knowledge  ability and the experience of our personnel as well as timely new product introductions 
we enter into employee proprietary information and inventions agreements with all employees and consultants to protect our technology and designs 
however  we do not believe that such protection can preclude competitors from developing substantially equivalent products 
employees as of june   we had employees  including in operations and manufacturing  in research and development  in customer service and technical support  in sales and marketing  and in administration and finance 
see footnote  subsequent events we also employ a small number of temporary employees and consultants as needed 
we are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement or other similar agreement 
we believe that we have a good relationship with our employees

risk factors our future results of operations are subject to risks and uncertainties over which we have limited control  and which could cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations 
we are subject to all of the business risks facing manufacturing companies  including business cycles and trends in the general economy  financial market conditions  demand variations and volatility  potential loss of key personnel  supply chain disruptions  government legislation and regulation  and natural causes 
the following list of risk factors is not all inclusive 
other factors and unanticipated events could adversely affect our financial position or results of operations 
we believe that the most significant potential risk factors that could adversely impact us are the following we face intense industry competition  price erosion and product obsolescence  which  in turn  could reduce our profitability 
we operate in an industry that is generally characterized by intense competition and rapid technological change 
we believe that the principal bases of competition in our markets are breadth of product line  quality of products  stability  reliability and reputation of the provider  along with cost 
quantity discounts  price erosion  and rapid product obsolescence due to technological improvements are therefore common in our industry as competitors strive to retain or expand market share 
product obsolescence can lead to increases in unsellable inventory that may need to be written off and therefore could reduce our profitability 
similarly  price erosion can reduce our profitability by decreasing our revenues and our gross margins 
our long term operating results depend substantially upon our ability to continually develop  introduce  and market new and innovative products  to modify existing products  to respond to technological change  and to customize certain products to meet customer requirements 
there are numerous risks inherent in this process  including the risks that we will be unable to anticipate the direction of technological change or that we will be unable to develop and market new products and applications in a timely fashion to satisfy customer demands  which could result in a decrease in our net sales and a loss of market share to our competitors 
historically  we have had write offs of excess and obsolete inventory which negatively impacted our results of operations 
in the future  excess or obsolete inventory may need to be written off  and this in turn could reduce our profitability 
changes in demand or downturns in the markets we serve could affect our business and profitability 
the industries into which we market and sell our products are cyclical and may experience downturns 
these industries also experience volatility  and future volatility as well as downturns  or any failure of these industries to recover from downturns  could materially harm our business and profitability 
likewise  if we have difficulty managing growth in this business  it could materially and adversely affect us 
in addition  our business and financial position may be adversely affected by current and future economic conditions that cause a decline in business and consumer spending in the markets served by our or our customer s products 
we rely on tape technology for a significant portion of our revenues 
our profitability may be impaired if demand for storage solutions using tape technology declines or fails to develop as we expect 
we will continue to be subject to the risk of a decrease in revenues if demand for tape based storage products declines or if rising prices make it more difficult to sell them 
if products incorporating other technologies gain comparable or superior market acceptance and competitive price advantage  our business  financial condition and operating results could be adversely and materially affected unless we successfully develop and market products incorporating the new technology 
our principal competitors devote greater financial resources to developing  marketing and selling their products 
consequently  we may be unable to maintain or increase our market share 
we face significant competition in developing and selling of our products 
rapid and ongoing changes in technology and product standards could quickly render our products less competitive  or even obsolete 
we have significantly fewer financial  technical  manufacturing  marketing and other resources than many of our competitors and these limited resources may impair the profitability of our business in many ways 
for example  in the past our competitors have offered wider ranges of products  expanded the geographic scope of their markets  acquired other companies  and developed or acquired proprietary technologies that operate in conjunction with their products 
in the future  our competitors may leverage their greater resources to develop  manufacture and market products that are less expensive or technologically superior to ours  reach a wider array of potential customers through a broader range of marketing and distribution channels  respond more quickly to new or changing technologies  customer requirements and standards  or reduce prices in order to preserve or gain market share 
we believe competitive pressures are likely to continue 
we cannot guarantee that our resources will be sufficient to address this competition or that we will manage costs and adopt strategies capable of effectively utilizing our resources 
if we are unable to respond to competitive pressures successfully  our prices and profit margins may fall and our market share may decrease 
because we rely on indirect sales channels to market and sell our branded storage products  a loss of or deterioration in our relationship with one or more of our resellers or distributors  or our inability to establish new indirect sales channels to drive growth of our branded products could negatively affect our operating results 
we sell the majority of our branded storage products to value added resellers vars  who in turn sell our products to end users 
in some cases  resellers integrate our tape libraries with products of other manufacturers and sell the combined products to their own customers the success of these sales channels is hard to predict  particularly over time  and we have no purchase commitments or long term orders from them that assure us of any baseline sales through these channels 
several of our resellers carry competing product lines that they may promote over our products  which may negatively impact our sales 
a reseller might not continue to purchase our products or market them effectively  and each reseller determines the type and amount of our products that it will purchase from us and the pricing of the products that it sells to end user customers 
establishing new indirect sales channels is an important part of our strategy to drive growth of our branded revenue 
our operating results could be adversely affected by any number of factors including a change in competitive strategy that adversely affects a reseller s willingness or ability to distribute our products  reaching fewer customers or losing sales due to ineffective marketing efforts of resellers  reduced margins and increased costs associated with reseller channel sales  an inability to gain traction in developing new indirect sales channels for our branded products  any financial difficulties of such resellers that result in their inability to pay amounts owed to us  or changes in requirements or programs that allow our products to be sold by third parties to government customers 
we do not have any exclusive agreements with our vars  who purchase our products on an individual purchase order basis 
if we lose important value added resellers or if they reduce their focus on our products or if we are unable to obtain additional value added resellers  our business could be negatively affected 
if our suppliers fail to meet our component and manufacturing needs  it could delay our production and our product shipments to customers and negatively affect our operations 
our products comprise many components and subassemblies produced by outside suppliers 
we depend greatly on these suppliers for items that are essential to the manufacture of our products  including tape drives  printed circuit boards and integrated circuits 
for certain items  we qualify only a single source  which magnifies the risk of shortages and decreases our ability to negotiate with that supplier on the basis of price 
from time to time  we have been unable to obtain sufficient components as we have needed due to shortages or quality issues from some of our suppliers 
if our suppliers fail to meet our manufacturing needs  it would delay our production and our product shipments to customers and negatively affect our operations 
we also rely on software vendors to develop and support software needed for operation of our automated tape library products and their integration into the user s computing environment 
accordingly  the continued development and future growth of the market for our tape library products will depend partly upon the ability of these vendors to meet the overall data storage and management needs of tape library purchasers and our ability to maintain relationships with these firms 
the primary suppliers of our npower power supplies are located in china 
if a manufacturer should be unable to deliver products to us on a timely basis or at all  our power supply business could be adversely affected 
though we have many years of favorable experience with these suppliers  there can be no assurance that circumstances might not change and compel one or both of these suppliers to curtail or terminate deliveries to us 
moreover  the use of contract manufacturers to provide our power supplies typically requires that we place production orders several months in anticipation of our expected need for the products 
this in turn leads to risks that we may lack sufficient inventory to sell to our customers where our expectations were conservative  or that we may order excess product inventory where our expectations were optimistic 
we have in the past  experienced shortages of some parts needed to manufacture our power supplies 
if we fail to develop and introduce new products on a timely and cost effective basis  or if our products do not contain the features required by the marketplace  we may eventually lose market share and sales to competitors 
the market for our products is characterized by changing technology and evolving industry standards 
our future results will depend on our ability to anticipate changes in technology  to develop new and enhanced products on a timely and cost effective basis  and to introduce  manufacture and achieve market acceptance of these new and enhanced products 
with respect to our tape library products in particular  the introduction of new storage technologies or the adoption of an industry standard different from our current product standards could render our existing products obsolete 
development schedules for high technology products are inherently subject to uncertainty and there can be no assurance we will be able to meet our product development schedules or that our development costs will be within budgeted amounts 
if the products or product enhancements developed are not deliverable due to technical problems  quality issues or component shortages  or if such products or product enhancements are not accepted by the marketplace or are unreliable  then our business  financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property or if others use our proprietary technology without authorization  our competitive position may suffer 
we rely on copyright protection of our software  firmware and electronic circuits  as well as patent protection for some of our products and product features 
we also rely on a combination of trademark  trade secret  and other intellectual property laws and various contract rights to protect our proprietary rights 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  however  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain or use our products or technology 
as a consequence  these rights may not preclude competitors from developing products that are substantially equivalent or superior to our products 
in addition  many aspects of our products are not subject to intellectual property protection and therefore can be reproduced by others 
undetected manufacturing flaws could increase our costs  reduce our revenues and divert resources from our core business needs 
despite our efforts to revise and update our manufacturing and test processes to address engineering and component changes  we may not be able to control and eliminate manufacturing flaws adequately 
these flaws may include undetected software or hardware defects associated with a newly introduced product  a new version of an existing product  or a product that has been integrated into a system or apparatus with the products of other vendors 
if we fail to adequately monitor  develop and implement appropriate test and manufacturing processes we could experience a rate of product failure that results in substantial shipment delays  warranty costs or damage to our reputation 
product flaws may also consume our limited engineering resources and interrupt our development efforts 
significant product failures would increase our costs and result in the loss of future sales and be harmful to our business 
much of our business is subject to risks associated with operations in foreign countries 
we generate a significant percentage of our revenue internationally  and we believe that international sales will continue to represent a substantial portion of our revenues 
in addition  our manufacturing of power supply products is performed by contract manufacturers in asia 
we face risks that the countries in which we conduct business  or in which we have customers  suppliers  or contract manufacturers could experience financial  economic or political instability  adopt laws that make the enforcement of our contractual or other legal rights and remedies difficult or uncertain  provide inadequate intellectual property protection for our technology  impose restrictions on the export or import of technology that would affect our ability to obtain supplies from  or sell products into  such countries  impose tariffs  quotas  taxes  other market barriers  or impose other laws  regulations or policies adversely affecting trade  investment or taxes  including those relating to the repatriation of funds and to withholding taxes 
other risks and costs associated with international operations include currency exchange risk  to the extent that exchange rate fluctuations could make our products unaffordable to foreign purchasers or more expensive compared to those of foreign manufacturers  compliance with laws and regulations in various regions in which we operate  greater difficulty and longer delays in collecting accounts receivable from international customers  increased risk of shipping disruptions particularly in foreign countries experiencing political instability 
our success depends on our ability to retain our senior management and to attract and retain key personnel 
turnover in key management positions could temporarily harm our financial performance and results of operations 
if we lose certain members of our senior management  our operations may be disrupted and our operating results could be adversely affected 
in addition  our capacity to develop and implement new technologies depends on our ability to employ personnel with highly technical skills 
if we cannot attract and retain key technical personnel  our technical expertise may suffer  and our operating results could be adversely affected 
in addition  it could be difficult  time consuming and expensive to replace any key management member or other critical personnel and no guarantee exists that we will be able to recruit suitable replacements or assimilate new key management personnel into our organization to achieve our operating objectives 
intellectual property infringement claims brought against us could result in substantial liability and significant costs  and  as a result  our business  financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected 
from time to time  we may become subject to claims or inquiries regarding an alleged unauthorized use by us of another party s intellectual property  such as our current litigation with overland storage described in item below 
while we currently believe the amount of ultimate liability  if any  with respect to any such actions will not materially affect our financial position  results of operations or liquidity  the ultimate outcome of any license discussion or litigation is uncertain 
adverse resolution of any infringement claim could subject us to substantial liabilities and require us to refrain from manufacturing and selling certain products 
in addition  the costs incurred in intellectual property litigation can be substantial  regardless of the outcome 
as a result  our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
our revenues and operating results may fluctuate unexpectedly from quarter to quarter  which may in turn affect our stock price 
our quarterly revenues and operating results have fluctuated in the past  and are likely to vary in the future due to the various factors discussed above and others  including general economic conditions affecting spending and the rates of growth or decline in the markets we serve  variations in product order backlogs  and reductions in the size  delays in the timing  or cancellation of significant customer orders  the timing of introductions and marketplace acceptance of new or enhanced products by us or our competitors  expansions or reductions in our relationships with distributors  value added reseller or original equipment manufacturer customers  unprofitable investments in research and development activities  or sales evaluation  testing  and acceptance processes  unforeseen warranty costs that exceed established reserves  timing and levels of our operating expenses  or emerging new technologies that change the nature of or need for our products 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not necessarily be reliable indicators of our future performance 
it is likely that in some future period our operating results will not meet your expectations or those of public market analysts 
any unanticipated change in revenues or operating results is likely to cause our stock price to fluctuate since such changes reflect new information available to investors and analysts 
new information may cause investors and analysts to revalue our stock and this  in the aggregate  may cause fluctuations in our stock price 
trading in our stock has historically been limited and our stock price has been volatile  which may affect your ability to sell your shares 
the average trading volume in our stock has been historically low  with little or no trading at all on some days 
this  as well as the factors listed below  has caused the price of our stock to be volatile 
consequently  it may be difficult to sell your shares of our stock at the price you paid for them or at a price equal to that quoted on the nasdaq stock market 
factors that may cause our stock price to fluctuate in the future include quarterly variations in operating results  especially if they differ from our previously announced forecasts or forecasts made by analysts  changes in or cancellation of our dividend payment policy  announcements by us of anticipated future revenues or operating results  or by others concerning us  our competitors  our customers  or our industry  the introduction of new technology or products by us or our competitors  comments about us and the data storage market made by industry analysts or on internet comment sites  changes in earnings estimates by analysts or changes in accounting policies  in product pricing policies by us or our competitors  or in general economic conditions 
in addition  stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume volatility in recent years 
this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities of many smaller public companies for reasons frequently unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the specific companies 
these market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
certain provisions in our charter documents and california law may hinder or prevent a change in control of our company 
certain provisions of our charter documents could make it difficult for a third party to obtain control of the company 
for example  our articles of incorporation and bylaws require that stockholders must timely inform our corporate secretary before a stockholders meeting if they wish to nominate directors or submit proposals for shareholder approval  and contain provisions that eliminate cumulative voting in the election of directors 
in addition  subject to the rules of the nasdaq stock market  our board of directors has the authority  without any action by the shareholders  to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to fix the rights and preferences of such shares 
these provisions may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control  may discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over its market price and may adversely affect the market price  and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock

we also are subject to a variety of other claims and legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business

overview qualstar corporation qualstar was incorporated in california in qualstar focuses its efforts on designing  developing  manufacturing and selling high efficiency ac dc and dc dc power supplies under its npower brand  and automated magnetic tape libraries used to store  retrieve and manage electronic data primarily in the network computing environment under its qualstar brand 
tape libraries consist of cartridge tape drives  tape cartridges and robotics to move the tape cartridges from their storage locations to the tape drives under software control 
qualstar s libraries provide storage solutions for organizations requiring backup  recovery and archival storage of critical electronic information 
in july  qualstar purchased the assets of npower  incorporated  a supplier of ultra small high efficiency open frame switching power supplies 
power supplies are sold with the npower brand name as well as under a private label brand name to original equipment manufacturers to incorporate into computer based products for telephony  industrial  gaming  test equipment and other applications 
npower is a division of qualstar 
net revenues include revenues from the sale of tape libraries  tape drives  tape cartridges  ancillary products  and power supplies 
ancillary revenues include spare parts  service  repair  and on site service agreements net of the cost of any third party service contracts 
revenues from our tape library segment represented approximately of revenues in fiscal  of revenues in fiscal  and of revenues in fiscal revenues from our power supply segment represented approximately of revenues in fiscal  of revenues in fiscal  and approximately of revenues in fiscal our international sales efforts are currently directed from our corporate offices in simi valley  california 
all of our international sales are denominated in us dollars 
net revenues from customers outside of north america were approximately million  or of revenues for fiscal  million  or of revenues for fiscal  and million  or of revenues for fiscal gross margins depend on several factors  including the cost of manufacturing  product mix and the level of competition 
larger tape libraries generally provide higher gross margins than do smaller tape libraries 
research and development activities include the design and development of new products  as well as enhancements to existing products 
we have evaluated our manufacturing operations  inventory  and facility utilization and implemented a restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of fiscal to reduce our costs in an effort to return to profitability 
we streamlined our product offerings by recognizing inventory reserves on the ten to fifteen year old tls and rls product lines that were experiencing declining revenue  competitive pricing pressures  and high manufacturing costs due to older generation technology  which were preventing us from competing effectively 
by discontinuing these legacy product lines  we have shifted our focus to our newer  technologically competitive rack mount and enterprise level tape library product lines 
we recorded a full inventory reserve of approximately  in the fourth quarter of fiscal on the discontinued tls and rls product lines  including finished goods  raw materials  drives and work in process 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to customer promotional offers  sales returns  bad debts  inventories  warranty costs  investments  and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized in accordance with accounting standards codification asc  revenue recognition  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  transfer of title has occurred  the price is fixed or readily determinable  and collectability is reasonable assured 
title and risk of loss transfer to the customer when the product leaves our dock in simi valley  california  or another shipping location designated by us 
in general  these customers are allowed to return the product  free of penalty  within thirty days of shipment  if the product does not conform to its specifications 
we record an allowance for estimated sales returns based on past experience and current knowledge of our customer base 
our experience has been such that only a very small percentage of products are returned 
should our experience change  however  we may require additional allowances for sales returns 
revenue for established products that have previously satisfied a customer s acceptance requirements and provide for full payment tied to shipment is generally recognized upon shipment and passage of title 
in limited cases where a prior history of customer acceptance cannot be demonstrated or sales where customer payment dates are not determinable or when collection is not reasonably assured  revenue is deferred until customer acceptance occurs or payment has been received 
on the limited shipments where sales are not recognized  gross profit is generally recorded as deferred profit in our consolidated balance sheet representing the difference between the receivable recorded and the inventory shipped 
at june  we had deferred revenue of approximately  and no deferred profit 
at june  we had deferred revenue of approximately  and no deferred profit 
marketable securities marketable securities consist primarily of high quality us corporate securities and us federal government debt securities 
our marketable securities portfolio consists of short term securities with original maturities of greater than three months from the date of purchase and remaining maturities of less than one year and long term securities with original maturities of greater than one year and less than five years 
marketable securities are classified as available for sale and are recorded at fair value using the specific identification method  unrealized gains and losses are reflected in other comprehensive income until realized  realized gains and losses are included in earnings when the underlying securities are sold and are derived using the specific identification method for determining the cost of securities sold 
if the credit ratings of the security issuers deteriorate or if normal market conditions do not return in the near future  we may be required to reduce the value of our investments through an impairment charge and reflect them as long term investments 
fair value of financial instruments we adopted asc  fair value measurements and disclosures on july  for all financial assets and liabilities and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
asc defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
asc defines fair value as the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid upon transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability 
the fair value should be calculated based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability  not on assumptions specific to the entity 
in addition  the fair value of liabilities should include consideration of non performance risk including our own credit risk 
in addition to defining fair value  asc expands the disclosure requirements around fair value and establishes a fair value hierarchy for valuation inputs 
the hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value is observable in the market 
each fair value measurement is reported in one of the three levels that are determined by the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
these levels are level inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets 
level inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active  and model based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
the fair values are therefore determined using model based techniques that include option pricing models  discounted cash flow models  and similar techniques 
in general  and where applicable  we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets to determine fair value 
this pricing methodology applies to our level investments such as us treasuries and agency securities and exchange traded mutual funds 
if quoted prices in active markets for identical assets are not available to determine fair value  then we use quoted prices for similar assets or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly 
these investments are included in level and consist primarily of corporate bonds  mortgage backed securities  and certain agency securities 
while we own certain mortgage backed fixed income securities  our portfolio as of june  does not contain direct exposure to subprime mortgages or structured vehicles that derive their value from subprime collateral 
our mortgage backed securities are collateralized by prime residential mortgages and carry a principal and interest guarantee  primarily from federal national mortgage association and federal home loan mortgage corporation 
our asset backed securities are senior tranches in regard to priority of principal repayment and are collateralized by predominantly prime rated receivables on consumer credit card  automobile loan and utility rate reduction securities 
allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts based on an assessment of the collectability of specific accounts and the overall condition of accounts receivable 
in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  we analyze specific trade receivables  historical bad debts  customer credits  customer credit worthiness and changes in customers payment terms and patterns 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make additional payments  then we may need to make additional allowances 
likewise  if we determine that we could realize more of our receivables in the future than previously estimated  we would adjust the allowance to increase income in the period we made this determination 
inventory valuation we record inventories at the lower of cost or market value 
we assess the value of our inventories periodically based upon numerous factors including expected product or material demand  current market conditions  technological obsolescence  current cost and net realizable value 
if necessary  we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence  potential shrinkage  or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if technology changes more rapidly than expected  or market conditions become less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
warranty obligations we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including active monitoring and evaluation of product failure rates  material usage and estimation of service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
however  should actual product failure rates  material usage  or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
historically our warranty costs have not been significant 
legal and other contingencies the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty 
an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
when legal costs are expected to be material that the entity expects to incur in defending itself in connection with a loss contingency accrual  the loss should factor in all costs and  if the legal costs are reasonably estimable  they should be accrued in accordance with asc  regardless of whether a liability can be estimated for the contingency itself 
disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred 
changes in these factors could materially impact our financial statements 
share based compensation share based compensation is accounted for in accordance with asc  compensation stock compensation 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine fair value of the award at the date of grant and recognize compensation expense over the vesting period 
the inputs we use for the model require the use of judgment  estimates and assumptions regarding the expected volatility of the stock  the expected term the average employee will hold the option prior to the date of exercise  expected future dividends  and the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
changes in these inputs and assumptions could occur and actual results could differ from these estimates  and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
accounting for income taxes we estimate our tax liability based on current tax laws in the statutory jurisdictions in which we operate in accordance with asc  income taxes 
these estimates include judgments about deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary differences between assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and such amounts recognized for tax purposes  as well as about the realization of deferred tax assets 
we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
asc also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities  classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions  and income tax disclosures 
we maintain a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of realizing the benefits of net deferred tax assets in future years 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for such a valuation allowance 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  the valuation allowance would be decreased accordingly 
we may periodically undergo examinations by the federal and state regulatory authorities and the internal revenue service 
we may be assessed additional taxes and or penalties contingent on the outcome of these examinations 
our previous examinations have not resulted in any unfavorable or significant assessments 
we have net operating losses  capital losses  research and development credit and other carry forwards for tax purposes of million at june  which expire between fiscal years and  except for the state research and development credit  which has no limit on the carry forward period

results of operations the following table reflects  as a percentage of net revenues  statements of operations data for the periods indicated years ended june  net revenues cost of goods sold gross margin operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative loss from operations other income loss before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes we have two operating segments for financial disclosure purposes tape libraries and power supplies  as discussed in footnote to our financial statements 
the following table summarizes our revenue by operating segment years ended june  power supply revenues tape library revenues product service total library revenues fiscal compared to fiscal net revenues 
net revenues were million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the decrease of approximately million  or is attributed primarily to a decrease of million in sales of tape libraries  partially offset by a million increase in sales of power supplies 
power supply segment revenues attributed to our power supply segment were million  or of revenues  in fiscal as compared to million  or of revenues  in fiscal the increase of million  or  was due to increased sales to original equipment manufacturers and distributors of an expanded power supply product line 
we expect continued growth as a percentage of total sales in our power supply revenues during fiscal tape library segment revenues attributed to our tape library segment were million or of revenues in fiscal  as compared to million  or of revenues in fiscal the decrease in tape library revenues was due to decreased sales of our tape library products in the tls and xls product lines and decreases in service  media and miscellaneous revenues  partially offset by increased revenues from our rls product line 
in addition  revenues in the last quarter of our fiscal year were impacted by the uncertainty surrounding our proxy contest with bkf capital group  which ended when our shareholders rejected bkf s attempt to replace our board of directors at the special meeting of shareholders on june  gross profit 
gross profit was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the decrease of approximately million  or  is attributed to a decrease in revenues  change in product mix and an increase in inventory reserves 
inventory reserves increased in fiscal due to the end of life on the tls and rls legacy product lines  in existence for and years  respectively 
the decline in selling prices has been impacted by technology rather than lower manufacturing costs 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million in fiscal  comparable to million in fiscal sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses were million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal the decrease of approximately million  or  is attributed to lower compensation and commission expenses related to headcount reductions and lower advertising and promotion expenses 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the increase of approximately million  or  is primarily attributed to an increase in legal and proxy expenses related to the special shareholder meeting and legal fee accruals related to pending litigation 
other income and expenses 
other income and expense in fiscal was  comprised of million investment income  offset by million in litigation fees 
benefit for income taxes 
provision for income taxes was  in fiscal compared to a benefit for income taxes of  in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal net revenues 
net revenues were million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the increase of approximately million  or is attributed primarily to an increase of million in sales of tape libraries and million in sales of power supplies 
power supply segment revenues attributed to our power supply segment were million  or of revenues  in fiscal as compared to million  or of revenues  in fiscal the increase of million  or  was due to increased sales to original equipment manufacturers and distributors of an expanded power supply product line 
tape library segment revenues attributed to our tape library segment were million  or of revenues in fiscal  as compared to million  or of revenues in fiscal this increase in tape library revenues was due primarily to higher sales of our tape library products in the rls and xls product lines  partially offset by decreased revenues from our tls product line  in conjunction with decreased sales of tape media and service revenue 
gross profit 
gross profit was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the increase of approximately million  or  is attributed to an increase in revenues  change in product mix  a decrease in inventory reserves  and higher absorption of labor and overhead 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal the decrease of approximately million  or  is attributed primarily to decreases in compensation expense related to headcount reductions and prototype material expenses 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses were million in fiscal  comparable with million in fiscal general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the decrease of approximately million  or  is primarily due to decreases in compensation expense related to headcount reductions and accounting and investor relations expenses 
investment income 
investment income was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the decrease of approximately million is attributed to lower rates in the current economic environment and a million decrease in the principal balance of our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
benefit for income taxes 
benefit for income taxes was  in fiscal liquidity and capital resources cash used in operating activities was million in each of fiscal and  and million in fiscal cash used in operating activities in fiscal relates primarily to our net loss for the year  an increase in inventories and a decrease in accrued payroll and related liabilities  partially offset by inventory reserves and an increase in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities 
cash used in operating activities in fiscal relates primarily to our net loss for the year and an increase in accounts receivable and inventories  partially offset by an increase in accounts payable 
cash used in operating activities in fiscal relates primarily to our net loss for the year and an increase in accounts receivable  partially offset by a decrease in inventories and an increase in accounts payable 
cash provided by investing activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal cash provided by investing activities in all three fiscal years relates primarily to proceeds from the sale of marketable securities  partially offset by purchases of marketable securities and equipment 
cash was not used in financing activities in fiscal years and cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal  relating to cash dividends declared on shares of our common stock 
as of june   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in marketable securities 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and funds available from the sale of our marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next months 
we may utilize cash to invest in businesses  products or technologies that we believe are strategic 
we periodically evaluate other companies and technologies for possible investment by us 
in addition  we have made and may in the future make investments in companies with whom we have identified potential synergies 
however  we have no present commitments or agreements with respect to any material acquisition of other businesses or technologies 
summary of contractual obligations and commitments the following is a summary of our future payments due under contractual obligations as of june  year ended june operating leases purchase obligations total in thousands purchase obligations in the table above represent the value of open purchase orders as of june  we believe that some of these obligations could be canceled for payment of a nominal penalty or no penalty  however  the amount of open purchase orders that could be canceled under such terms is difficult to quantify 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to foreign currency and interest rate risks 
our financial results could be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
as all sales are currently made in us dollars  a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in shorter duration fixed income securities 
we have no outstanding debt nor do we utilize derivative financial instruments 
therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosures are required
