overview we are a leading provider of automation  vacuum and instrumentation solutions for multiple markets and are a valued business partner to original equipment manufacturers oems and equipment users throughout the world 
we serve markets where equipment productivity and availability is a critical factor for our customers success  typically in demanding temperature and or pressure environments 
our largest served market is the semiconductor capital equipment industry  which represented approximately  and of our consolidated revenues for fiscal years  and  respectively 
these decreases are the result of our efforts to target certain non semiconductor revenue opportunities  including acquisitions and a divestiture which has led to an increase in the non semiconductor portion of our revenues 
the non semiconductor markets served by us include life sciences  industrial capital equipment and other adjacent technology markets 
the demand for semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment is cyclical  resulting in periodic expansions and contractions of this market 
demand for our products has been impacted by these cyclical industry conditions 
our revenues from the latter half of fiscal through fiscal year benefited from an upturn in the semiconductor capital equipment market 
revenues for fiscal year have been impacted by our acquisitions and divestures  and also impacted more recently by weakness in demand for semiconductor capital equipment 
we expect this weakness to continue into the early part of fiscal year we expect the semiconductor equipment market will continue to be a key end market for our products  however  we intend to acquire and develop technologies that will create opportunities outside of the semiconductor market 
we completed the following acquisitions and investments to expand our life sciences product offering rts life sciences rts  a united kingdom based provider of automation solutions to the life sciences markets  acquired on april  for million  net of cash on hand  nexus biosystems  inc nexus  a california based provider of automation solutions and consumables to the life sciences markets on july  for million  net of cash on hand  
table of contents the celigo automated cell cytometer product line from cyntellect inc  a life sciences product used for cellular imaging  acquired on december  for million in cash  plus a deferred cash payment of million that was paid in july although we have entered into transactions to expand the non semiconductor portions of our business  we will continue to make investments to maintain and grow our semiconductor product and service offerings 
on january   we acquired primarily intangible assets from intevac  inc for million 
we will use these assets in the development of a next generation of semiconductor automation tools 
we expensed essentially all of this asset purchase as an in process research and development cost in the three months ended march  on october   we acquired crossing automation inc crossing  a us based provider of automation solutions for the global semiconductor front end markets 
the purchase price was approximately million  which is subject to a working capital adjustment to be determined subsequent to the closing 
on april   we entered into an agreement with affiliates of celestica inc celestica to sell the assets of our contract manufacturing segment the business 
the sale was completed on june  for a purchase price of million in cash  plus million as consideration for cash acquired in the sale 
an additional million of proceeds was paid during our fourth quarter of  which represents a working capital normalizing adjustment 
in addition  brooks and celestica entered into certain commercial supply and license agreements at the closing of the sale 
pursuant to those agreements  brooks supplies celestica with certain products and has licensed to celestica certain intellectual property needed to run the business and celestica supplies certain products to brooks 
due to the significance of these ongoing commercial arrangements  the sale did not qualify for discontinued operations treatment 
therefore  historical financial results of the divested business are not segregated within our consolidated financial statements for the historical periods in which this business was part of us 
we report financial results in four segments brooks product solutions  brooks global services  brooks life science systems and contract manufacturing 
this financial reporting structure was implemented effective as of the beginning of our fourth quarter of fiscal year in response to changes in our management structure as well as the acquisition of two life science companies in the second half of fiscal the brooks product solutions segment provides a variety of products critical to technology equipment productivity and availability 
those products include atmospheric and vacuum tool automation systems  atmospheric and vacuum robots and robotic modules and cryogenic vacuum pumping  thermal management and vacuum measurement solutions which are used to create  measure and control critical process vacuum applications 
the brooks global services segment provides an extensive range of support services including on and off site repair services  on and off site diagnostic support services  and installation services to enable our customers to maximize process tool uptime and productivity 
this segment also provides end user customers with spare parts support services to maximize customer tool productivity 
the brooks life science systems segment provides automated sample management systems for automated cold sample storage  automated blood fractionation equipment  sample preparation and handling equipment  cellular imaging  consumables  and parts and support services to a wide range of life science customers including pharmaceutical companies  biotechnology companies  biobanks  national laboratories  research institutes and research universities 
the contract manufacturing segment provided services to build equipment front end modules  vacuum transport modules and other subassemblies which enabled our customers to effectively source high quality and high reliability process tools for semiconductor market applications 
we sold this segment on june  in the third quarter of fiscal  we identified prior period errors related to the accounting for our equity method investment in ulvac cryogenics  inc uci 
we determined that certain subsidiaries of uci were not fully included in the results uci reported to us and therefore not reflected within equity in earnings of joint ventures in our consolidated statements of operations or within equity investment in joint ventures in our consolidated balance sheets for the quarterly and annual periods beginning in the fiscal year ended september  through the quarterly period ended march  we concluded that these errors were not material 
table of contents individually or in the aggregate to any of the prior reporting periods  and therefore  amendments of previously filed reports were not required 
however  if the entire correction was recorded in the third quarter of  the cumulative amount would be material in the year ended september  and would have impacted comparisons to prior periods 
as such  the revisions for these corrections to the applicable prior periods are reflected in the financial information herein and will be reflected in future filings containing such financial information 
the revision had no net impact on the company s consolidated statements of cash flows for any prior period 
the specific amount of each revision is detailed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  goodwill  income taxes  warranty obligations  pensions and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  including current and anticipated worldwide economic conditions both in general and specifically in relation to the semiconductor industry  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
as discussed in the year over year comparisons below  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenues product revenues are associated with the sale of hardware systems  components and spare parts as well as product license revenue 
service revenues are associated with service contracts  repairs  upgrades and field service 
shipping and handling fees  if any  billed to customers are recognized as revenue 
the related shipping and handling costs are recognized in cost of sales 
revenue from product sales that does not include significant customization is recorded upon delivery and transfer of risk of loss to the customer provided there is evidence of an arrangement  fees are fixed or determinable  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured and  if applicable  customer acceptance criteria have been successfully demonstrated 
customer acceptance provisions include final testing and acceptance carried out prior to shipment 
these pre shipment testing and acceptance procedures ensure that the product meets the published specification requirements before the product is shipped 
when significant on site customer acceptance provisions are present in the arrangement  revenue is recognized upon completion of customer acceptance testing 
revenue from product sales that does include significant customization  which primarily include life science automation systems  is recorded using the percentage of completion method whereby revenue is recorded as work progresses based on a percentage that incurred labor effort to date bear to total projected labor effort 
in addition  contracts are reviewed on a regular basis to determine whether a loss exists 
a loss will be accrued in the period in which estimated contract revenue is less than the current estimate of total contract costs 
revenue associated with service agreements is generally recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
revenue from repair services or upgrades of customer owned equipment is recognized upon completion of the repair effort and upon the shipment of the repaired item back to the customer 
in instances where the repair or upgrade includes installation  revenue is recognized when the installation is completed 
intangible assets  goodwill and other long lived assets as a result of our acquisitions  we have identified intangible assets other than goodwill and generated significant goodwill 
general intangible assets other than goodwill are valued based on estimates of future cash flows and amortized over their estimated useful life 
goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing as well as testing upon the occurrence of any event that indicates a potential impairment 
general intangible assets other 
table of contents than goodwill and other long lived assets are subject to an impairment test if there is an indicator of impairment 
we conduct our annual goodwill impairment test as of our fiscal year end  or september th 
our tests of goodwill as of september   and indicated that we did not have any impairment to goodwill 
under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  the testing of goodwill for impairment is to be performed at a level referred to as a reporting unit 
a reporting unit is either the operating segment level or one level below  which is referred to as a component 
the level at which the impairment test is performed requires an assessment as to whether the operations below the operating segment constitute a self sustaining business  testing is generally required to be performed at this level 
we currently have three reporting units that have goodwill  including two reporting units that are part of our brooks product solutions operating segment and the sole reporting unit included in our brooks life science systems operating segment 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units using an income approach  specifically the discounted cash flow method dcf method 
the dcf method includes five year future cash flow projections  which are discounted to present value  and an estimate of terminal values  which are also discounted to present value 
terminal values represent the present value an investor would pay today for the rights to the cash flows of the business for the years subsequent to the discrete cash flow projection period 
we consider the dcf method to be the most appropriate valuation indicator as the dcf analyses are based on management s long term financial projections 
however  we also use market based valuation techniques to test the reasonableness of the fair values determined by the dcf method 
we also compare the aggregate fair value of our reporting units and corporate assets to our overall market capitalization 
goodwill impairment testing is a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its respective carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired 
if the reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds the fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be completed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
the second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying value of goodwill 
the implied fair value is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit  the excess of the fair value over amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill determined in this step is compared to the carrying value of goodwill 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference 
for our annual goodwill impairment test as of september   we determined that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and no impairment existed 
the fair value of the two reporting units that are part of our brooks product solutions operating segment each exceeded their carrying value by more than 
the fair value of the brooks life science systems operating segment exceeded its carrying value by 
the discount rate used in the dcf analysis for the brooks life science systems operating segment was 
the revenue multiple used in the terminal value calculation for the brooks life science systems operating segment was x  and is consistent with revenue multiples of peers in the life science industry 
the final terminal value calculation for this reporting unit reflects an equal weighting of a revenue multiple and capitalizing cash flow from the terminal year  which is consistent with our approach utilized in the prior year 
we acquired the businesses comprising the brooks life science systems operating segment at various dates over the last eighteen months 
while we believe our assumptions are reasonable  actual results could differ from our projections 
to the extent projected results of cash flows are revised downward  the reporting unit may be required to write down all or a portion of its goodwill  which would adversely impact our earnings 
under gaap  we are required to test long lived assets  which exclude goodwill and intangible assets that are not amortized  when indicators of impairment are present 
for purposes of this test  long lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
when we determine that indicators of potential impairment exist  the next step of the impairment test requires that the potentially impaired long lived asset group is tested for recoverability 
the test for recoverability compares the undiscounted future cash flows of the long lived asset group to its carrying value 
if the carrying values of the long lived asset group exceed the future cash flows  the assets are considered to be potentially impaired 
the next step in the impairment process is to 
table of contents determine the fair value of the individual net assets within the long lived asset group 
if the aggregate fair values of the individual net assets of the group are less than the carrying values  an impairment charge is recorded equal to the excess of the aggregate carrying value of the group over the aggregate fair value 
the loss is allocated to each asset within the group based on their relative carrying values  with no asset reduced below its fair value 
we have not tested long lived assets other than goodwill since  since no events have occurred that would require an impairment assessment 
accounts receivable we record trade accounts receivable at the invoiced amount 
trade accounts receivables do not bear interest 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable 
we determine the allowance based on historical write off experience 
we review our allowance for doubtful accounts quarterly 
past due balances are reviewed individually for collectibility 
account balances are charged off against the allowance when we feel it is probable the receivable will not be recovered 
we do not have any off balance sheet credit exposure related to our customers 
warranty we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligation is estimated by assessing product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and may result in additional benefits or charges to operations 
inventory we provide reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
we fully reserve for inventories and noncancelable purchase orders for inventory deemed obsolete 
we perform periodic reviews of all inventory items to identify excess inventories on hand by comparing on hand balances to anticipated usage using recent historical activity as well as anticipated or forecasted demand  based upon sales and marketing inputs through our planning systems 
if estimates of demand diminish further or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
deferred taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have considered recent historical income  estimated future taxable income  carry forward periods of tax attributes  the volatility of the semiconductor industry and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
in the event we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in excess of their net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we subsequently determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
prior to fiscal year management had concluded that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would not be realized and recorded a full valuation allowance against all global deferred tax assets 
as of september  management has changed this judgment upon the careful consideration of all available positive and negative evidence 
the positive evidence considered was three year us historical cumulative income  projected future taxable income and the length of carry forward periods of tax attributes 
the primary negative evidence to be considered is the volatility of the semiconductor industry which creates uncertainty in forecasting profits 
as a result of this change in judgment we recorded a tax benefit of million resulting from the reduction in the valuation allowance 
we continue to maintain a valuation allowance in the us against certain tax attributes based on the uncertainty of their realization based on long term forecasts and the expiration dates of the attributes 

table of contents we also maintain a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions 
we will continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance in future periods 
if future operating results of the us or these foreign jurisdictions significantly exceed expectations it is reasonably possible that there could be a further reduction in the valuation allowance in the future 
further reduction of the valuation allowance  in whole or in part  would result in a non cash income tax benefit during the period of reduction 
pension plans our us defined benefit pension plan was fully settled in september but we continue to sponsor two non us defined benefit pension plans 
the cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working  the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease 
major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels 
assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with third party actuaries  and are evaluated each year as of the plans measurement date 
total pension costs for our pension plans totaled million for fiscal year  which includes an million settlement charge for the us plan 
our unfunded benefit obligation totaled million at september   as compared to million at september  should any of our assumptions change  they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation 
we expect to contribute approximately million to our defined benefit pension plans during fiscal year stock based compensation we measure compensation cost for all employee stock awards at fair value on date of grant and recognize compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest 
the fair value of restricted stock is determined based on the number of shares granted and the excess of the quoted price of our common stock over the exercise price of the restricted stock on the date of grant  if any  and the fair value of stock options is determined using the black scholes valuation model 
such value is recognized as expense over the service period  net of estimated forfeitures 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires significant judgment 
we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures  including types of awards  employee class  and historical experience 
in addition  for stock based awards where vesting is dependent upon achieving certain operating performance goals  we estimate the likelihood of achieving the performance goals 
actual results  and future changes in estimates  may differ from our current estimates 
year ended september   compared to year ended september  revenues we reported revenues of million for fiscal year  compared to million in the previous year  a decrease 
the total decrease in revenues of million is the result of the sale of our contract manufacturing segment  which had revenues of million in the prior year  decreased demand for our brooks product solutions products which resulted in million of decreased revenues and reduced demand for products and services from our brooks global services segment which resulted in million of lower revenues 
these decreases were partially offset by million of increased revenues from our brooks life science systems segment due to the acquisitions of rts and nexus in the last half of fiscal our brooks product solutions segment reported revenues of million for fiscal year  a decrease of from million in the prior year 
these decreases are attributable to lower volumes of shipments to most of the end markets served by this segment 
recent demand for semiconductor capital equipment has declined  and we expect this reduction in demand to result in lower revenues for this segment in the near term as compared to the revenues achieved in the fourth quarter of fiscal year our brooks global services segment reported revenues of million for fiscal year  a decrease from million in the prior year 
the decrease includes a million decrease in product revenues  which are comprised mostly of spare part sales to end users 
this decrease  which is primarily attributable to decreased demand from our semiconductor customers  is partially offset by a million increase in revenues from services 

table of contents our brooks life science systems segment reported revenues of million for fiscal year  a increase from million in the prior year 
this increase is primarily the result of the timing of our acquisitions 
we acquired rts on april   nexus on july  and celigo on december  revenues for this segment for fiscal year include million of product revenue  which includes sales of automated systems and consumables 
the balance of the fiscal year revenues  or million  is comprised of service revenues to support deployed automation systems 
our contract manufacturing segment reported revenues of million for fiscal year this segment was sold on june  revenues from the brooks product solutions segment for the fiscal year include intercompany sales of million from this segment to the contract manufacturing segment 
these intercompany revenues have been eliminated from the revenues of contract manufacturing 
revenues for the contract manufacturing segment for the fiscal year exclude intercompany sales of million from this segment to the brooks product solutions segment 
revenues outside the united states were million  or of total revenues  and million  or of total revenues  for fiscal years and  respectively 
we expect that revenues outside the united states will continue to account for a significant portion of total revenues 
gross margin gross margin percentage increased to for fiscal year  compared to for the prior year 
this increase was primarily attributable to a more favorable product mix with the addition of our higher margin brooks life science systems segment and the sale of our lower margin contract manufacturing segment 
this increase in gross margin percentage was partially offset by weaker margins in our brooks product solutions and brooks global services segments 
gross margin percentage of our brooks product solutions segment decreased to for fiscal year as compared to in the prior year 
the decrease was due in part to a less favorable product mix  which decreased gross margin by  plus increased charges for excess and obsolete inventory which reduced gross margin by 
the balance of the reduction in gross margin is mostly attributable to reduced production and lower absorption of our fixed costs 
the reduced cost absorption is the result of weakening demand for semiconductor capital equipment  as the industry is currently experiencing a cyclical downturn 
we recently initiated restructuring programs to better align the resources of this segment with expected future business requirements 
gross margin percentage of our brooks global services segment decreased to for fiscal year as compared to in the prior year 
this decrease is due to lower sales of higher margin spare parts  which reduced gross margin by  higher charges for excess and obsolete inventory which reduced gross margin by  with the balance of the decrease primarily attributable to increased costs to expand our service capacity 
during the latter part of fiscal  we initiated cost reduction initiatives to align the resources of this segment with future business requirements 
gross margin percentage for our brooks life science systems segment increased to for fiscal year as compared to in the prior year 
the increase is due to the reduction of purchase accounting related adjustments that impact the valuation of deferred revenue obligations and the step up in value of acquired inventory  which reduced gross margin percentage by for fiscal year as compared to a reduction of for the prior year 
in addition  reduced charges for excess and obsolete inventories for fiscal year as compared to the prior year resulted in a improvement in gross margin percentage 
the balance of the increase relates to the increased production and improved absorption of our fixed costs 
these increases in gross margin percentage were partially offset by increased amortization for completed technology intangible assets which decreased gross margin percentage by as compared to the prior year 
gross margin percentage for our contract manufacturing segment for fiscal year was 
the sale of this lower gross margin segment at the end of our third quarter of fiscal year has led to an overall increase in our consolidated post sale gross margin percentage 

table of contents research and development research and development  or r d  expenses for fiscal year were million  an increase of million  compared to million in the previous year 
this increase relates primarily to our life sciences acquisitions  which increased r d expenses by million over the prior year 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses were million for fiscal year  a decrease of million compared to million in the prior year 
the decrease is attributable to million of net insurance proceeds as reimbursement of litigation related costs previously incurred which was recorded as a reduction to sg a during the three months ended march   a million reduction of labor related costs as a result of lower accruals for incentive based compensation due to the company s reduced financial performance and million of lower labor costs due to cost reduction programs implemented in the latter half of fiscal year these decreases were partially offset by the acquisitions of nexus and rts  which increased sg a costs by million  including million of amortization of intangible assets 
other cost increases include million of higher consulting costs in connection with our initiatives to improve certain operating efficiencies 
restructuring charges we recorded a restructuring charge of million for fiscal year these charges are related primarily to a series of workforce reductions implemented to improve the company s cost structure by eliminating employees 
the brooks product solutions segment incurred a severance charge of million to eliminate positions  brooks global services segment incurred a severance charge of million to eliminate positions  and we incurred million to eliminate corporate support positions 
these workforce reductions were implemented to better align our resources with our future requirements 
the brooks life science systems segment incurred severance charges of million to eliminate positions  mainly due to the consolidation of administrative functions 
we estimate million of aggregate annual savings from the workforce reductions completed during fiscal we are continuing to evaluate our cost structure  and could take additional severance charges during the first quarter of fiscal year all unpaid severance charges as of september  will be paid during fiscal year  with a significant majority paid during the first half of fiscal year we recorded a restructuring charge of million for fiscal year these charges include severance related costs of million  which are comprised of million of severance for the elimination of employees  including employees in the brooks life science systems segment resulting from the consolidation of certain functions as the operations of rts and nexus are combined into one operating segment  and million of adjustments for contingent severance arrangements for corporate management positions eliminated in prior periods 
we also incurred million of facility related costs for facilities exited in previous years 
the costs for these exited facilities ended as of september  pension settlement during the quarter ended march   we advised participants of our frozen us defined benefit pension plan that we intend to settle this pension obligation during fiscal year this settlement occurred in the quarter ended september  and resulted in accelerated cash payments of approximately million by the company to fully satisfy the pension liability  and resulted in an accelerated amortization of approximately million of prior pension losses that were previously reported in accumulated other comprehensive income 
in process research and development during the three months ended march   we acquired primarily intellectual property from intevac  inc for million 
management evaluated this asset purchase to determine if this acquisition would be considered an acquisition of a business 
since only a limited amount of assets were acquired  management concluded that the inputs and processes required to meet the definition of a business were not acquired in this 
table of contents transaction  therefore  this transaction was treated as the purchase of an asset group 
this asset group includes primarily intellectual property that will be utilized in the development of a next generation of semiconductor automation tools that resides within the brooks product solutions segment 
we expensed essentially all of this asset purchase as an in process research and development cost in the three months ended march  interest income interest income was million for both fiscal year and sale of contract manufacturing business in we closed the sale of our extended factory contract manufacturing business on june  with affiliates of celestica inc the gross proceeds on this transaction were million  of which million was received on the closing 
the balance of million represents a working capital normalizing adjustment  and was received during our fourth quarter of the gross proceeds included the reimbursement of million of cash on hand at the closing offset by million of transaction expenses 
the pre tax gain on the sale was million 
our fiscal year income tax provision includes million of incremental taxes on this gain 
we also entered into certain commercial supply and license agreements with celestica which will govern the ongoing relationship between celestica and us 
pursuant to those agreements we will supply celestica with certain products and have licensed to celestica certain intellectual property needed to run the business and celestica will supply certain products to us 
due to the significance of these ongoing commercial arrangements  the sale did not qualify for discontinued operations treatment 
therefore  historical financial results of the divested business will not be segregated within our consolidated financial statements for the historical periods in which this business was part of us 
other income other income  net of million for fiscal year consists primarily of joint venture management fee income of million which has been partially offset by foreign exchange losses of million 
other income  net of million for fiscal year consists primarily of joint venture management fee income of million and million from a litigation settlement 
income tax provision benefit we recorded an income tax benefit of million for fiscal year this benefit includes a million deferred income tax benefit  primarily resulting from a significant reduction in the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
we considered the weight of both positive and negative evidence as of september  and concluded that a substantial portion of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the tax benefit for fiscal year was partially offset by us state income taxes and foreign taxes 
we recorded an income tax provision of million for fiscal year  which includes million of foreign and us state income taxes  and an additional million of income taxes relating to the sale of our contract manufacturing segment 
these provisions have been reduced by net favorable adjustments of million to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits  primarily due to the expiration of certain statutes and a favorable audit outcome 
we provided a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets at september  considering the weight of both positive and negative evidence as of september   we concluded that it was more likely than not that the future tax benefits from accumulated net operating losses and other temporary differences would not be realized 
equity in earnings of joint ventures income associated with our interest in ulvac cryogenics  inc  a joint venture with ulvac corporation of japan  was million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year  due to the decline in demand for semiconductor capital equipment 
these numbers reflect the revision to uci s earnings as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
income associated with our interest in yaskawa brooks automation  inc  a joint venture with yaskawa electric corporation of japan was million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year 
table of contents year ended september   compared to year ended september  revenues we reported revenues of million for fiscal year  compared to million in the previous year  a increase 
the total increase in revenues of million is the result of increased demand for our products and services which resulted in million of increased revenues from our brooks product solutions segment and million of higher revenues from our brooks global services segment 
in addition  the acquisitions of rts and nexus provided million of increased revenues from our brooks life science systems segment 
these increases were partially offset by an million decrease in contract manufacturing revenues  due to the sale of that segment at the end of our third fiscal quarter 
our brooks product solutions segment reported revenues of million for fiscal year  an increase of from million in the prior year 
these increases are primarily attributable to higher volumes of shipments to semiconductor capital equipment customers  which increased million for fiscal year as compared to the prior year  and an increase of million from non semiconductor customers for fiscal year as compared to the prior year 
our brooks global services segment reported revenues of million for fiscal year  a increase from million in the prior year 
the increase includes a million increase in product revenues  which are comprised mostly of spare part sales to end users  and a million increase in revenues from services 
these increases are primarily attributable to increased demand from our semiconductor customers 
our brooks life science systems segment reported revenues of million for fiscal year this segment includes revenues for rts  which was acquired on april  and for nexus  which was acquired on july  revenues from these newly acquired entities are included in our operating results from their respective acquisition dates through the end of our fiscal year 
revenue from this segment includes million for the sale of product  including automation systems and consumables  and includes million of service revenue for the support of deployed automation systems 
our contract manufacturing segment reported revenues of million for fiscal year  a decrease from million in the prior year 
this decrease is due to the sale of this segment at the end of our third fiscal quarter 
through the first nine months of fiscal year  contract manufacturing revenues increased as compared to the same prior year period 
revenues from the brooks product solutions segment for the fiscal years and include intercompany sales of million and million  respectively  from this segment to the contract manufacturing segment 
these intercompany revenues have been eliminated from the revenues of contract manufacturing 
revenues for the contract manufacturing segment for the fiscal years and exclude intercompany sales of million and million  respectively  from this segment to the brooks product solutions segment 
revenues outside the united states were million  or of total revenues  and million  or of total revenues  for fiscal years and  respectively 
gross margin gross margin percentage increased to for fiscal year  compared to for the prior year 
this increase is primarily attributable to higher absorption of indirect factory overhead on higher revenues 
further  the sale of our contract manufacturing segment  which earned lower gross margins than our other operating segments  favorably impacted our gross margin percentage in the fourth quarter of fiscal year these increases in gross margin percentage were partially offset by reduced benefits from the sale of previously reserved excess and obsolete inventory 
the increase in the net charge for excess and obsolete inventory in fiscal year as compared to the prior year decreased gross margin percentage by 
gross margin percentage of our brooks product solutions segment was for fiscal year as compared to in the prior year 
this increase is primarily the result of higher absorption of indirect factory 
table of contents overhead on higher revenues 
this increase was partially offset by increased net charges for excess and obsolete inventory which reduced gross margin percentage by as compared to the prior year 
gross margin percentage of our brooks global services segment was for fiscal year as compared to in the prior year 
the increase in gross margin percentage was attributable to higher absorption of indirect service overhead on higher revenues 
in addition  decreased charges for excess and obsolete inventory led to an increase in gross margin percentage of for fiscal year as compared to the prior year 
gross margin percentage for our brooks life science systems segment was for fiscal year  and has been reduced for the impact of the valuation of deferred revenue obligations and the step up in value of acquired inventory 
gross margin percentage was also decreased by for charges for excess and obsolete inventories 
gross margin was further reduced by for amortization of completed technology intangible assets 
gross margin percentage of our contract manufacturing segment was for fiscal year as compared to in the prior year 
for the first nine months of fiscal year  revenues for contract manufacturing had increased over the same prior year period 
this increase in revenues led to higher absorption of indirect factory overhead and resulted in a higher gross margin percentage 
research and development r d expenses for fiscal year were million  an increase of million  compared to million in the previous year 
this increase includes million of r d costs incurred by rts and nexus since their respective acquisition dates 
the balance of the increase is the result of our increased pace of spending for r d throughout fiscal year as we supported certain enhancements to our product offerings

we believe that we have adequate resources to fund our currently planned working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months 
the cyclical nature of our served markets and uncertainty with the current global economic environment makes it difficult for us to predict longer term liquidity requirements with certainty 
we may be unable to obtain any required additional financing on terms favorable to us  if at all

other key indicators of financial condition and operating performance ebitda and adjusted ebitda presented below are supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by  or presented in accordance with gaap 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not measurements of our financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as alternatives to net income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with gaap 
ebitda represents net income before interest income  income tax provision benefit  depreciation and amortization 
adjusted ebitda is defined as ebitda further adjusted to give effect to certain non recurring and or non cash items and other adjustments 
we believe that the inclusion of ebitda and adjusted ebitda in this form k is appropriate because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our performance and believe it is frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties 
we use adjusted ebitda internally as a critical measurement of operating effectiveness 
we believe ebitda and adjusted ebitda facilitates operating performance comparison from period to period and company to company by backing out potential differences caused by variations in capital structures  tax positions such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates or net operating losses and the age and book depreciation of facilities and equipment affecting relative depreciation expense 
in determining adjusted ebitda  we eliminate the impact of a number of items 
for the reasons indicated herein  you are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment and whether you consider it appropriate 
in addition  in 
table of contents evaluating adjusted ebitda  you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in the presentation of adjusted ebitda 
our presentation of adjusted ebitda should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non recurring items 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda have limitations as analytical tools  and you should not consider them in isolation  or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
some of these limitations are they do not reflect our cash expenditures for capital expenditure or contractual commitments  they do not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital requirements  other companies  including other companies in our industry  may calculate these measures differently than we do  limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure 
because of these limitations  ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business 
for these purposes  we rely on our gaap results

table of contents in fiscal  based on a review of nexus inventory values performed shortly after the closing of the acquisition  we recorded a charge of million for excess and obsolete inventories 
in connection with the acquisitions of rts  nexus and celigo  we allocated the purchase price to the net assets acquired based on the fair value of each asset and liability 
as part of this allocation  we valued certain inventory and deferred revenue balances above and below their pre acquisition carrying values  respectively 
these adjustments reduced our net income for fiscal year by million and by million in fiscal year in fiscal  we received million of proceeds from the sale of our stock by a former executive  and remitted half of these proceeds to our insurance providers 
we recorded million of income from this settlement

the increase in adjusted ebitda from fiscal to fiscal is primarily related to increased revenue  which led to a million increase in gross profits 
this increase in gross profit for fiscal as compared to fiscal was partially offset by higher operating expenses

recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an amendment to the accounting requirements of goodwill  which requires a qualitative approach to considering impairment for a reporting unit with zero or negative carrying value 
on october  we adopted this standard  which had no impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued an amendment to the accounting requirements of business combinations  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for pro forma revenue and earnings of the combined entity for the current and comparable reporting periods 
on october  we adopted this standard  which had no impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued updated accounting guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures that result in common fair value measurements and disclosures between gaap and international financial reporting standards 
this guidance includes amendments which change the wording used to describe many of the requirements in us gaap for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
on january  we adopted this standard  which had no impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued an amendment to the accounting guidance for presentation of comprehensive income 
under the amended guidance  a company may present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
this authoritative guidance eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholder s equity 
this amendment is effective for annual periods beginning after december  other than a change in presentation  the adoption of this guidance will not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued revised guidance intended to simplify how an entity tests goodwill for impairment 
the amendment will allow an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
an entity no longer will be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines  based on a qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
on october  we adopted this standard  which had no impact on our financial position or results of operations
