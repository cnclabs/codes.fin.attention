item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under gaap with certain non gaap financial measures  including percentage sales growth in constant currency  adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted net earnings per share 
we believe that these non gaap measures provide meaningful information to assist shareholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance 
management believes percentage sales growth in constant currency  adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share are important indicators of our operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results and provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses 
management uses these non gaap financial measures for reviewing the operating results of reportable business segments  for analyzing potential future business trends in connection with our budget process and bases certain annual bonus plans on these non gaap financial measures 
to measure percentage sales growth in constant currency  we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect the comparability and trend of sales 
percentage sales growth in constant currency is calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates 
to measure earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis  we exclude certain items that affect the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings 
because non gaap financial measures are not standardized  it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies non gaap financial measures having the same or similar names 
these adjusted financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported sales growth  net earnings and diluted net earnings per share  the most directly comparable gaap financial measures 
these non gaap financial measures are an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that  when viewed with our gaap results and the reconciliations to corresponding gaap financial measures at the end of the discussion of results of operations below  provide a more complete understanding of our business 
we strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure

total debt was  in and  in share repurchases 
the total use of cash for share repurchases was in and in liquidity our cash and marketable securities were  at december  and  at december  and our current assets exceeded current liabilities by  at december  and  at december  we anticipate being able to support our short term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations 
we have funded  and may continue from time to time to fund  ourselves in the capital markets 
we have strong short and long term debt ratings that we believe should enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due 
in addition  we have a  credit facility with a diverse group of financial institutions that  if needed  should provide sufficient funding to meet short term financing requirements 
we had approximately  of borrowing capacity available under all of our existing credit facilities at december  at december   approximately of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were held in locations outside of the united states 
these funds are considered indefinitely reinvested to be used to expand operations either organically or through acquisitions outside the united states 
we do not intend to repatriate any significant amounts of cash in the foreseeable future

contractual obligations and forward looking cash requirements as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements  as of december  our defined benefit pension plans were in an underfunded status of  of which approximately related to plans outside the united states 
due to the rules affecting tax deductible contributions in the jurisdictions in which the plans are offered and the impact of future plan asset performance  changes in interest rates and the potential for changes in legislation in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions  we are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods  beyond  in which contributions to fund defined benefit pension plans will be made 
as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements  as of december   we have recorded a liability for uncertain income tax positions of due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of income tax audits  we are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which income tax payments to settle these uncertain income tax positions will be made 
our future contractual obligations for agreements with initial terms greater than one year  including agreements to purchase materials in the normal course of business  are payment period after total short term and long term debt unconditional purchase obligations operating leases contributions to defined benefit plans other critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our financial statements in accordance with us gaap  there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application 
these include allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves  income taxes  acquisitions  goodwill and intangible assets  and legal and other contingencies 
we believe these accounting policies  and others set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements  should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding our results of operations and financial condition 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the collection of accounts receivable 
we make estimates regarding the future ability of our customers to make required payments based on historical credit experience and expected future trends 
if actual customer financial conditions are less favorable than projected by management  additional accounts receivable write offs may be necessary  which could unfavorably affect future operating results 
inventory reserves we maintain reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell certain products at prices in excess of current carrying costs 
we make estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and record provisions based on historical experience  expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends 
if actual product life cycles  product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required  which could unfavorably affect future operating results 
income taxes our annual tax rate is determined based on our income  statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes 
tax law requires certain items be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return  and some differences are temporary  reversing over time  such as depreciation expense 
these temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effect of items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment has been deferred  the tax effect of expenditures for which a deduction has already been taken in our tax return but has not yet been recognized in our financial statements or assets recorded at fair value in business combinations for which there was no corresponding tax basis adjustment 
inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans  tax planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes 
realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified 
jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowances  will be realized 
we operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments 
in certain of these jurisdictions  we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable  but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority 
these differences of interpretation with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment 
we evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes 
we review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of tax audits  and adjust them accordingly 
we have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions 
although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain  based on currently available information  we believe that it is more likely than not that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
because there are a number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision  certain changes or future events such as changes in tax legislation  geographic mix of earnings  completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate 
acquisitions  goodwill and intangibles we account for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting 
under the purchase method  our consolidated financial statements include the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the acquisition 
in addition  the assets acquired and liabilities assumed must be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values  with any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill 
significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives 
accordingly  we typically obtain the assistance of third party valuation specialists for significant items 
the fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management  but are inherently uncertain 
we typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets  which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets 
significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants and include the amount and timing of future cash flows including expected growth rates and profitability  the underlying product or technology life cycles  the economic barriers to entry and the discount rate applied to the cash flows 
unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur that could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions 
determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment 
certain intangibles are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands 
other acquired intangible assets eg  certain trademarks or brands  customer relationships  patents and technologies are expected to have determinable useful lives 
our assessment as to trademarks and brands that have an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life is based on a number of factors including competitive environment  market share  trademark and or brand history  underlying product life cycles  operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the trademarks or brands are sold 
our estimates of the useful lives of determinable lived intangibles are primarily based on these same factors 
all of our acquired technology and customer related intangibles are expected to have determinable useful lives 
the costs of determinable lived intangibles are amortized to expense over their estimated life 
the value of indefinite lived intangible assets and residual goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment 
our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite lived intangibles 
we perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year 
we have early adopted the provisions of accounting standards update asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other testing goodwill for impairment  which permits us to consider qualitative indicators of the fair value of a reporting unit when it is unlikely that a reporting unit has impaired goodwill 
in certain circumstances  we may also utilize a discounted cash flow analysis that requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding market conditions and our future profitability 
in those circumstances we test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level 
we test individual indefinite lived intangibles by reviewing the individual book values compared to the fair value 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets based on the income approach 
under the income approach  we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value 
assumptions used in our impairment evaluations  such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital  are consistent with internal projections and operating plans 
we believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants 
when certain events or changes in operating conditions occur  indefinite lived intangible assets may be reclassified to a determinable life asset and an additional impairment assessment may be performed 
dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified 
we did not recognize any material impairment charges for goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets during the years presented as our annual impairment testing indicated that all reporting unit goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset fair values exceeded their respective recorded values 
however  future changes in the judgments  assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  including discount and tax rates or future cash flow projections  could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values 
a significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges that could materially affect the financial statements in any given year 
the recorded value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets from recently acquired businesses are derived from more recent business operating plans and macroeconomic environmental conditions and  therefore  are more susceptible to an adverse change that could require an impairment charge 
we review long lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows  which is at the individual asset level or the asset group level  as defined 
undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over their useful life based on updated projections 
if the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable  any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related assets or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique 
assets classified as held for sale are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
legal and other contingencies we are involved in various proceedings  legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business  including proceedings related to product  labor and intellectual property  and other matters that are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the outcomes of these matters will generally not be known for prolonged periods of time 
in certain of the legal proceedings  the claimants seek damages  as well as other compensatory and equitable relief  which could result in the payment of significant claims and settlements and or the imposition of injunctions or other equitable relief 
for legal matters for which management has sufficient information to reasonably estimate our future obligations  a liability representing management s best estimate of the probable cost  or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within the range is not known  for the resolution of these legal matters is recorded 
the estimates are based on consultation with legal counsel  previous settlement experience and settlement strategies 
if actual outcomes are less favorable than those projected by management  additional expense may be incurred  which could unfavorably affect future operating results 
to partially mitigate losses arising from unfavorable outcomes in such matters  we purchase third party insurance coverage subject to certain deductibles and loss limitations 
future operating results may be unfavorably impacted by any settlement payments or losses beyond the amounts of insurance carried 
in addition  such matters may negatively impact our ability to obtain cost effective third party insurance coverage in future periods 
new accounting pronouncements no new accounting pronouncements that were issued or became effective during the year have had or are expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
other information hedging and derivative financial instruments we distribute our products throughout the world 
as a result  our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as weak economic conditions or changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
our operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the united states dollar  european currencies  in particular the euro  swiss franc and the british pound  the japanese yen  the australian dollar and the canadian dollar 
we develop and manufacture products in the united states  china  france  germany  ireland  puerto rico and switzerland and incur costs in the applicable local currencies 
this worldwide deployment of facilities serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on our cost of sales 
we enter into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies  thereby limiting risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates 
these nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to intercompany receivables and payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products 
the periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions  with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies 
all forward currency exchange contracts are recorded at their fair value each period  with resulting gains losses included in other income expense in the consolidated statements of earnings 
the estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at month end spot rates as adjusted by current forward points 
a hypothetical change in foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar would change the december  fair value by approximately we are exposed to credit loss in the event of non performance by dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified 
counterparties on our outstanding forward currency exchange contracts  but we do not anticipate nonperformance by any of our counterparties 
we have certain investments in net assets in international locations that are not hedged 
these investments are subject to translation gains and losses due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
for  the strengthening of united states dollar relative to foreign currencies decreased the value of these investments in net assets and the related foreign currency translation adjustment loss in shareholders equity by  to from at december  legal and regulatory matters in april lawsuits brought by hill rom company  inc and affiliated entities against us were filed in the united states district court for the western district of wisconsin and the united states district court for the southern district of indiana 
the suits allege infringement under united states patent laws with respect to certain patient handling equipment manufactured and sold by us and seek damages and permanent injunctions 
the wisconsin lawsuit has subsequently been transferred to the united states district court in indiana 
we intend to vigorously defend ourselves in these matters 
in the third quarter of  we received a subpoena from the united states department of justice related to sales  marketing and regulatory matters related to the stryker painpump 
also in the third quarter of  we received a subpoena from the united states department of justice related to the sales and marketing of the otisknee device 
these investigations are ongoing 
in march a shareholder s derivative action complaint against certain of our current and former directors and officers was filed in the united states district court for the western district of michigan southern division 
this lawsuit was brought by the westchester putnam counties heavy and highway laborers local benefit funds and laborers local benefit funds 
the complaint alleges claims for breach of fiduciary duties and gross mismanagement in connection with certain product recalls  united states food and drug administration fda warning letters  government investigations relating to physician compensation and the criminal proceeding brought against our biotech division 
the case has been stayed while a special committee of the board of directors evaluates the claims 
in january a purported class action lawsuit against us was filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york on behalf of those who purchased our common stock between january  and november   inclusive 
the lawsuit seeks remedies under the securities exchange act of in may the lawsuit was transferred to the united states district court for the western district of michigan southern division 
we are defending ourselves vigorously 
in a federal grand jury in the district of massachusetts returned an indictment charging stryker biotech llc and certain then current employees and a former employee of stryker biotech with wire fraud  conspiracy to defraud the fda  distribution of a misbranded device and false statements to the fda
