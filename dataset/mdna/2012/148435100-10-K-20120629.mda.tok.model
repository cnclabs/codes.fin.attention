item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our objective is to continue building a distinctive portfolio of global premium and super premium spirits and fine wine brands as we move towards profitability 
to achieve this  we continue to seek to increase revenues from our more profitable brands 
we continue to focus our distribution relationships  sales expertise and targeted marketing activities on our more profitable brands  improve value chain and manage cost structure 
we continue to review and analyze our supply chains and cost structures both on a company wide and brand by brand basis  as well as control general and administrative costs in an effort to further reduce expense  and selectively add new premium brands to our portfolio 
we intend to continue developing new brands and pursuing strategic relationships  joint ventures and acquisitions to selectively expand our premium spirits and wine portfolio  particularly by capitalizing on and expanding our partnering capabilities 
our criteria for new brands focuses on underserved areas of the beverage alcohol marketplace  while examining the potential for direct financial contribution to our company and the potential for future growth based on development and maturation of agency brands 
we evaluate future acquisitions and agency relationships on the basis of their potential to be immediately accretive and their potential contributions to our objectives of becoming profitable and further expanding our product offerings 
we expect that future acquisitions  if consummated  would involve some combination of cash  debt and the issuance of our stock

keltic facility in august  we entered into a revolving loan agreement loan agreement with keltic financial partners ii  lp  a delaware limited partnership keltic  which we refer to as the keltic facility  providing for availability subject to certain terms and conditions of up to  for the purpose of providing working capital 
the keltic facility expires on august  we may borrow up to the maximum amount of the keltic facility  provided that we have a sufficient borrowing base as defined in the loan agreement 
the keltic facility interest rate is the rate that  when annualized  is the greatest of a the prime rate plus  b the libor rate plus  and c 
interest is payable monthly in arrears  on the first day of every month on the average daily unpaid principal amount of the keltic facility 
after the occurrence and during the continuance of any default or event of default as defined under the loan agreement we are required to pay interest at a rate that is per annum above the then applicable keltic facility interest rate 
in addition to a  commitment fee  keltic will also receive an annual facility fee and a collateral management fee 
the loan agreement contains standard borrower representations and warranties for asset based borrowing and a number of reporting obligations and affirmative and negative covenants 
the loan agreement includes negative covenants that  among other things  restrict our ability to create additional indebtedness  dispose of properties  incur liens  and make distributions or cash dividends 
at march   we were in compliance  in all material respects  with the covenants under the keltic facility 
in june  we executed a term sheet with keltic regarding a proposed increase in availability subject to certain terms and conditions under the keltic facility from  to  for the purpose of providing us with additional working capital 
the proposed amendment would also make certain changes to the borrowing base as defined under the existing loan agreement and would provide for an additional  commitment fee and an increased annual facility fee 
operations overview we generate revenue through the sale of our products to our network of wholesale distributors or  in control states  state operated agencies  which  in turn  distribute our products to retail outlets 
in the us  our sales price per case includes excise tax and import duties  which are also reflected as a corresponding increase in our cost of sales 
most of our international sales are sold in bond  with the excise taxes paid by our customers upon shipment  thereby resulting in lower relative revenue as well as a lower relative cost of sales  although some of our united kingdom sales are sold tax paid  as in the us the difference between sales and net sales principally reflects adjustments for various distributor incentives 
our gross profit is determined by the prices at which we sell our products  our ability to control our cost of sales  the relative mix of our case sales by brand and geography and the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
our cost of sales is principally driven by our cost of procurement  bottling and packaging  which differs by brand  as well as freight and warehousing costs 
we purchase certain products  such as gosling s rums  pallini liqueurs  a 
de fussingy cognacs  gozio amaretto and tierras tequila  as finished goods 
for other products  such as jefferson s bourbons  we purchase the components  including the distilled spirits  bottles and packaging materials  and have arrangements with third parties for bottling and packaging 
our us sales typically have a higher absolute gross margin than in other markets  as sales prices per case are generally higher in the us selling expense principally includes advertising and marketing expenditures and compensation paid to our marketing and sales personnel 
our selling expense  as a percentage of sales and per case  is higher than that of our competitors because of our brand development costs  level of marketing expenditures and established sales force versus our relatively small base of case sales and sales volumes 
however  we believe that maintaining an infrastructure capable of supporting future growth is the correct long term approach for us 
while we expect the absolute level of selling expense to increase in the coming years  we expect selling expense as a percentage of revenues and on a per case basis to decline  as our volumes expand and our sales team sells a larger number of brands 
general and administrative expense relates to corporate and administrative functions that support our operations and includes administrative payroll  occupancy and related expenses and professional services 
we expect general and administrative expense in fiscal to be comparable to fiscal  as we continue to control core spending 
we expect our general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales to decline due to economies of scale 
we expect to increase our case sales in the us and internationally over the next several years through organic growth  and through the extension of our product line via line extensions  acquisitions and distribution agreements 
we will seek to maintain liquidity and manage our working capital and overall capital resources during this period of anticipated growth to achieve our long term objectives  although there is no assurance that we will be able to do so 
we continue to believe the following industry trends will create growth opportunities for us  including the divestiture of smaller and emerging non core brands by major spirits companies as they continue to consolidate  increased barriers to entry  particularly in the us  due to continued consolidation and the difficulty in establishing an extensive distribution network  such as the one we maintain  the trend by small private and family owned spirits brand owners to partner with  or be acquired by  a company with global distribution 
we expect to be an attractive alternative to our larger competitors for these brand owners as one of the few modestly sized publicly traded spirits companies  and growth in the non spirits segments of the beverage alcohol industry  particularly wine  which may allow us to grow our portfolio and leverage our distribution network 
our growth strategy is based upon partnering with other brands  acquiring smaller and emerging brands and growing existing brands 
to identify potential partner and acquisition candidates we plan to rely on our management s industry experience and our extensive network of industry contacts 
we also plan to maintain and grow our us and international distribution channels so that we are more attractive to spirits companies who are looking for a route to market for their products 
we expect to compete for foreign and small private and family owned spirits brands by offering flexible and creative structures  which present an alternative to the larger spirits companies 
we intend to finance our brand acquisitions through a combination of our available cash resources  third party financing and  in appropriate circumstances  the further issuance of equity and or debt securities 
acquiring additional brands could have a significant effect on our financial position  and could cause substantial fluctuations in our quarterly and yearly operating results 
also  the pursuit of acquisitions and other new business relationships may require significant management attention 
we may not be able to successfully identify attractive acquisition candidates  obtain financing on favorable terms or complete these types of transactions in a timely manner and on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
financial performance overview the following table provides information regarding our beverage alcohol case sales for the periods presented based on nine liter equivalent cases  which is a standard industry metric years ended march  cases united states   international   total   rum   vodka   liqueurs   whiskey   tequila   wine   other  total   percentage of cases united states international total rum vodka liqueurs whiskey tequila wine other total the following table provides information regarding our case sales of non beverage alcohol products for the periods presented years ended march  cases united states   international   total   united states international total critical accounting policies and estimates a number of estimates and assumptions affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  amounts of sales and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and other factors and circumstances 
we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances  however  actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe that the estimates and assumptions discussed below are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations in that they require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments and form the basis for the accounting policies deemed to be most critical to our operations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales when the product is shipped to a customer generally a distributor  title and risk of loss has passed to the customer under the terms of sale fob shipping point or fob destination and collection is reasonably assured 
we do not offer a right of return but will accept returns if we shipped the wrong product or wrong quantity 
revenue is not recognized on shipments to control states in the us until such time as the product is sold through to the retail channel 
accounts receivable we record trade accounts receivable at net realizable value 
this value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts to reflect any loss anticipated on the trade accounts receivable balances and charged to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we calculate this allowance based on our history of write offs  level of past due accounts based on contractual terms of the receivables and our relationships with  and economic status of  our customers 
inventory valuation our inventory  which consists of distilled spirits  bulk wine  dry good raw materials bottles  labels and caps  packaging and finished goods  is valued at the lower of cost or market  using the weighted average cost method 
we assess the valuation of our inventories and reduce the carrying value of those inventories that are obsolete or in excess of our forecasted usage to their estimated realizable value 
we estimate the net realizable value of such inventories based on analyses and assumptions including  but not limited to  historical usage  future demand and market requirements 
reduction to the carrying value of inventories is recorded in cost of goods sold 
goodwill and other intangible assets as of march  and  we recorded million and million  respectively  of goodwill that arose from acquisitions 
goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired 
intangible assets with indefinite lives consist primarily of rights  trademarks  trade names and formulations 
we are required to analyze our goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis as well as when events and circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred 
certain factors that may occur and indicate that an impairment exists include  but are not limited to  operating results that are lower than expected and adverse industry or market economic trends 
we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets using a two step impairment test approach at the reporting unit level 
in the first step the fair value for the reporting unit is compared to its book value including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the book value  a second step is performed which compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to the book value of the goodwill 
the fair value for the goodwill is determined based on the difference between the fair values of the reporting units and the net fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities of such reporting units 
if the fair value of the goodwill is less than the book value  the difference is recognized as an impairment 
the fair value of each reporting unit was determined at each of march  and by weighting a combination of the present value of our discounted anticipated future operating cash flows and values based on market multiples of revenue and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda of comparable companies 
we did not record an impairment on goodwill or other intangible assets for fiscal or intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to the estimated residual values and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we are required to amortize intangible assets with estimable useful lives over their respective estimated useful lives to the estimated residual values and to review intangible assets with estimable useful lives for impairment in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
stock based awards we follow current authoritative guidance regarding stock based compensation  which requires all share based payments  including grants of stock options  to be recognized in the income statement as an operating expense  based on their fair values on the grant date 
stock based compensation was million for each of fiscal and we used the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted 
the assumptions used in valuing the options granted during fiscal and are included in note to our consolidated financial statements 
fair value of financial instruments asc  financial instruments asc  defines the fair value of a financial instrument as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties and requires disclosure of the fair value of certain financial instruments 
we believe that there is no material difference between the fair value and the reported amounts of financial instruments in the balance sheets due to the short term maturity of these instruments  or with respect to the debt  as compared to the current borrowing rates available to us 
further  our investments have been classified within level of asc and are reported at fair value 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of net sales of certain items in our consolidated financial statements

ebitda is considered a non gaap financial measure as defined by regulation g promulgated by the sec under the securities act of  as amended 
we consider ebitda  as adjusted  important in evaluating our performance on a consistent basis across various periods 
due to the significance of non cash and non recurring items  ebitda  as adjusted  enables our board of directors and management to monitor and evaluate the business on a consistent basis 
we use ebitda  as adjusted  as a primary measure  among others  to analyze and evaluate financial and strategic planning decisions regarding future operating investments and allocation of capital resources 
we believe that ebitda  as adjusted  eliminates items that are not indicative of our core operating performance  such as severance expense  are due to changes in valuation  such as the fair value of warrant liability  or do not involve a cash outlay  such as stock based compensation expense 
our presentation of ebitda  as adjusted  should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non recurring items or by non cash items  such as non cash compensation  which is expected to remain a key element in our long term incentive compensation program 
ebitda  as adjusted  should be considered in addition to  rather than as a substitute for  income from operations  net income and cash flows from operating activities 
our ebitda  as adjusted  improved to million for the year ended march   as compared to million for the comparable prior year period  primarily as a result of our increased gross margin and lower selling expense 
fiscal compared with fiscal net sales 
net sales increased to million for the year ended march   as compared to million for the comparable prior year period 
our us case sales as a percentage of total case sales increased to for the year ended march   as compared to for the comparable prior year period due to the organic growth of certain brands and the introduction of new brands into the us market  partially offset by a decrease in our wine sales 
our wine sales decreased due to the unavailability of certain vintages and production timing  as well as our decision to increase sales efforts on our spirits portfolio 
our international case sales remained relatively constant  due to strong growth in our gosling s sales  offset by an overall decrease due to changes in our international operations  increased price competition and overall market conditions 
we continue to focus on our faster growing and more profitable brands and markets  both in the us and internationally 
fiscal us net sales include full period revenues from the sales of travis hasse s pie liqueurs and a 
de fussigny cognacs  each of which we launched in the middle of our fiscal year 
fiscal net sales also included million in revenue from our jefferson s rye  which we launched in june  and million in revenue from our gosling s dark n stormy pre mixed cocktail  which we launched in february the growth in us sales also reflects the momentum for our gosling s rums  jefferson s bourbons  pallini limoncello  our irish whiskeys and our brady s irish cream

gross profit increased to million for the year ended march  from million for the comparable prior year period  and our gross margin increased to for the year ended march  compared to for the comparable prior year period  primarily due to increased sales of our higher margin spirits products in the current year 
during the year ended march   we recorded net allowance for obsolete and slow moving inventory of million 
we recorded this allowance on both raw materials and finished goods  primarily in connection with label and packaging changes made to certain brands  as well as wine spoilage and certain cost variances 
the net million charge has been recorded as an increase to cost of sales in the current year 
during the year ended march   we recorded a reversal of our allowance for obsolete and slow moving inventory of million 
we recorded this reversal because we were able to sell certain goods included in the allowance recorded during previous fiscal years 
net of the changes in allowance for obsolete inventories  our gross margin for the years ended march  and was and  respectively 
selling expense 
selling expense decreased to million for the year ended march  from million for the comparable prior year period 
this decrease in selling expense was due to a million reduction in employee related charges  including salaries and entertainment expense  offset by a million increase in selling expense in support of our revenue growth 
selling expense for the year ended march  also included million in severance charges 
the decrease in selling expense and an increase in sales resulted in a net decrease of selling expense as a percentage of net sales to for the year ended march  as compared to for the comparable prior year period 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense increased to million for the year ended march  as compared to million for the comparable prior year period  primarily due to a million increase in employee related expenses  including salaries and entertainment expense  and a million increase in other general and administrative expenses  including capital based taxes and corporate filing fees  offset by a million decrease in insurance costs 
the increase in general and administrative expense  offset by an increase in sales in the current period  resulted in general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales decreasing to for the year ended march  as compared to for the comparable prior year period 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization was million for each of the years ended march  and loss from operations 
as a result of the foregoing  our loss from operations improved to million for the year ended march  from million for the comparable prior year period 
as a result of our focus on our stronger growth markets and better performing brands  and expected growth from our existing brands and recently acquired brands  we anticipate improved results of operations in the near term as compared to comparable prior year periods  although there is no assurance that we will attain such results 
net change in fair value of warrant liability 
we recorded the fair market value of the warrants issued in connection with the june private placement at their initial fair value 
changes in the fair value of the warrants are recognized in earnings for each reporting period 
for the year ended march   we recorded a gain for the change in the value of the warrants of million 
loss from equity investment in non consolidated affiliate 
we have accounted for our investment in dpcp on the equity method of accounting 
loss from this investment was million for the year ended march  as compared to a gain of million for the year ended march  foreign exchange loss 
foreign exchange loss for the year ended march  was million as compared to a loss of million for the year ended march  due to the net effects of fluctuations of the us dollar against the euro and their effects on our euro denominated intercompany balances due to our foreign subsidiaries for inventory purchases 
interest expense  net 
we had interest expense  net of million for the year ended march  as compared to interest expense  net of million for the year ended march  the increase in interest expense is due to the outstanding balances on our notes payable as described below in liquidity and capital resources 
we expect interest expense to decrease in future periods due to the conversion of debt to series a preferred stock and warrants in connection with our june private placement transaction  which was completed during the year ended march  net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests during each of the years ended march  and was a loss of million  both the result of allocated net results recorded by our owned subsidiary  gosling castle partners  inc dividend to preferred shareholders 
for the year ended march   we recognized a deemed dividend on our series a preferred stock of million  the result of the calculated beneficial conversion feature and accrued dividends  as required by the terms of the preferred stock 
accrued dividends on our series a preferred stock are only payable in common stock upon conversion or liquidation 
net loss attributable to common shareholders 
as a result of the net effects of the foregoing  net loss attributable to common shareholders improved to million for the year ended march  as compared to million for the prior year period 
net loss per common share  basic and diluted  was per share for each of years ended march  and potential fluctuations in quarterly results and seasonality our industry is subject to seasonality with peak sales in each major category generally occurring in the fourth calendar quarter  which is our third fiscal quarter 
this holiday demand typically results in slightly higher sales for us in our second and or third fiscal quarters 
however  the growth of gosling s rums in recent years has led to improved fourth fiscal quarter revenues 
liquidity and capital resources overview since our inception  we have incurred significant operating and net losses and have not generated positive cash flows from operations 
for the year ended march   we had a net loss of million  and used cash of million in operating activities 
as of march   we had cash and cash equivalents of and had an accumulated deficit of million 
existing financing in august  we entered into the keltic facility  which provides for availability of up to million for the purpose of providing working capital 
the keltic facility expires on august  we may borrow up to the maximum amount of the keltic facility  provided that we have a sufficient borrowing base as defined in the loan agreement 
the keltic facility interest rate is the rate that  when annualized  is the greatest of a the prime rate plus  b the libor rate plus  and c 
interest is payable monthly in arrears  on the first day of every month on the average daily unpaid principal amount of the keltic facility 
after the occurrence and during the continuance of any default or event of default as defined under the loan agreement we are required to pay interest at a rate that is per annum above the then applicable keltic facility interest rate 
we paid keltic a  commitment fee and are also required to pay an annual facility fee and a collateral management fee 
the loan agreement contains standard borrower representations and warranties for asset based borrowing and a number of reporting obligations and affirmative and negative covenants 
the loan agreement includes negative covenants that  among other things  restrict our ability to create additional indebtedness  dispose of properties  incur liens  and make distributions or cash dividends 
as of march   we had borrowed million of the million then available under this facility 
at march   we were in compliance  in all material respects  with the covenants under the keltic facility 
we are in discussions with keltic to amend the keltic facility to increase the availability subject to certain terms and conditions under such facility to up to million 
in december  gosling castle partners  inc  a owned subsidiary  issued a promissory note the gcp note in the aggregate principal amount of million to gosling s export bermuda limited in exchange for credits issued on certain inventory purchases 
this note matures on april   is payable at maturity  subject to certain acceleration events  and calls for annual interest of  to be accrued and paid at maturity 
we believe our current cash and working capital  and the proposed increased availability under the keltic facility  will enable us to fund our losses until we achieve profitability  ensure continuity of supply of our brands  and support new brand initiatives and marketing programs 
debt conversion and retirement in december  we issued promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of million to frost gamma investments trust  vector group ltd  ivc investors  lllp  mark andrews and richard lampen 
borrowings under these notes were to mature on june  and bore interest at a rate of per annum

interest was accrued quarterly and was due at maturity 
in october  the frost note  and accrued but unpaid interest thereon  was converted into series a preferred stock and warrants as part of the june private placement

under the credit agreement  we were able to borrow from time to time up to million to be used for working capital or general corporate purposes

the note was secured under a security agreement by the betts scholl inventory acquired 
the note provided for an initial payment of million  paid at closing  and for eight equal quarterly payments of principal and interest  with the final payment due on september  interest under the note accrued at an annual rate of  compounded quarterly

in august  million of principal and accrued interest was paid on this note in connection with the closing of the keltic facility 
in october  the remaining million due under this note was converted into series a preferred stock and warrants as part of the june private placement 
liquidity discussion as of march   we had shareholders equity of million as compared to million at march  this increase is primarily due to the million of capital raised and the approximately million of debt converted in the june private placement transaction  offset by our total comprehensive loss for the year ended march  we had working capital of million at march  as compared to million as of march  this increase is primarily due to a million increase in inventory resulting from bulk purchases of wine and bourbon  the production timing of certain finished goods  and the million increase in accounts receivable  offset by a million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
as of march   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million  as compared to million as of march  the decrease is primarily attributable to the funding of our operations and working capital needs for the year ended march  and by million in note and credit facility payments  offset by the million of capital raised in the june private placement transaction and the million drawn on the keltic facility 
at march   we also had approximately million of cash restricted from withdrawal and held by a bank in ireland as collateral for overdraft coverage  creditors insurance  revolving credit  and other working capital purposes 
the following may result in a material decrease in our liquidity over the near to mid term continued significant levels of cash losses from operations  our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing should it be required  an increase in working capital requirements to finance higher levels of inventories and accounts receivable  our ability to maintain and improve our relationships with our distributors and our routes to market  our ability to procure raw materials at a favorable price to support our level of sales  potential acquisitions of additional brands  and expansion into new markets and within existing markets in the us and internationally 
we continue to implement a plan to support the growth of existing brands through sales and marketing initiatives that we expect will generate cash flows from operations in the next few years 
as part of this plan  we seek to grow our business through expansion to new markets  growth in existing markets and strengthened distributor relationships 
further  we are actively seeking to reduce certain inventory levels in an effort to reduce our working capital requirements and provide improved cash flow from operations 
we are also seeking additional brands and agency relationships to leverage our existing distribution platform 
we intend to finance our brand acquisitions through a combination of our available cash resources  borrowings and  in appropriate circumstances  additional issuances of equity and or debt securities 
acquiring additional brands could have a significant effect on our financial position  could materially reduce our liquidity and could cause substantial fluctuations in our quarterly and yearly operating results 
we continue to look to reduce expense  seek improvements in routes to market and contain production costs to improve cash flows 
as of march   we had borrowed million of the million available under the keltic facility  leaving million in then potential availability for working capital needs 
we believe our current cash and working capital  and the proposed increased availability under the keltic facility  will enable us to fund our losses until we achieve profitability  ensure continuity of supply of our brands  and support new brand initiatives and marketing programs through at least march cash flows the following table summarizes our primary sources and uses of cash during the periods presented years ended march  in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities   investing activities financing activities   effect of foreign currency translation net decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities 
a substantial portion of available cash has been used to fund our operating activities 
in general  these cash funding requirements are based on operating losses  driven chiefly by the costs in maintaining our distribution system and our sales and marketing activities 
we have also utilized cash to fund our receivables and inventories 
in general  these cash outlays for receivables and inventories are only partially offset by increases in our accounts payable to our suppliers 
on average  the production cycle for our owned brands is up to three months from the time we obtain the distilled spirits  bulk wine and other materials needed to bottle and package our products to the time we receive products available for sale  in part due to the international nature of our business 
we do not produce gosling s rums  pallini liqueurs  tierras tequila  gozio amaretto  or a 
de fussigny cognacs 
instead  we receive the finished product directly from the owners of such brands
