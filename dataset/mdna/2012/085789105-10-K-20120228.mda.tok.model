item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data and the accompanying financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our future plans  estimates  beliefs and expected performance 
our actual results may differ materially because of a number of risks and uncertainties 
some of these risks and uncertainties are detailed in part i  item a 
risk factors  and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview our results are directly related to the realized prices of oil  natural gas and electricity sold  the type and volume of oil and natural gas produced and electricity generated and the results of development  exploitation  acquisition and hedging activities 
the realized prices for natural gas and electricity will fluctuate from one period to another due to regional market conditions and other factors  while oil prices are predominantly influenced by global supply and demand 
beginning in the second half of and through  oil prices rebounded from the lows seen during the recent recession and financial crises 
natural gas prices have fallen significantly since their peak in the third quarter of and have remained low through the aggregate amount of oil and natural gas we produce may fluctuate based on the success of development and exploitation of oil and natural gas reserves pursuant to current reservoir management 
the principal influences on our operating costs include the cost of natural gas used in our steam operations and electrical generation  production rates  labor and equipment costs  maintenance expenses and production taxes 
we have historically been a net producer of natural gas and have benefited operationally when natural gas prices increase 
our production of natural gas has  in the past  provided a form of natural hedge against rising steam costs 
as our natural gas production continues to decrease and our use of natural gas for steaming operations increase  we may become a net consumer of natural gas and would no longer benefit operationally when natural gas prices increase 
diatomite we received a new full field development approval in late july from the california department of conservation  division of oil  gas and geothermal resources doggr with respect to our diatomite assets 
the approval contained operating requirements that were significantly more stringent than similar specifications contained in prior approvals from doggr 
the development of our diatomite assets and associated production growth were on track in  but the implementation of these newer operating requirements negatively impacted the pace of drilling and steam injection  and this impact has continued into we are working constructively with doggr on the operating specifications for our diatomite assets to enable an increase in the pace of our development 
on february   we received revisions to the july project approval letter  which  among other things  allow us to conduct mechanical integrity testing at least once every five years  rather than annually as provided in the original project approval letter 
in addition  we are longer required to cease cyclic steaming operations on wells located within feet of a failed well bore  subject to demonstrating to doggr that steam injection into such surrounding wells will be confined to the diatomite zone 
our estimates of well performance and ultimate recovery for the asset remain unchanged 
we are currently assessing the impact of the revised project approval letter on the development and operations of our diatomite properties

texas natural gas properties 
in  the effective income tax rate was impacted by reduced state rates and a decrease in our liability related to uncertain income tax positions 
our estimated annual effective income tax rate varies from the federal statutory rate due to the effects of state income taxes and estimated permanent differences ie  differences between book earnings and taxable income that are not expected to reverse in future periods

historically  we have used cash flow from operations and borrowings under our credit facility as our primary sources of liquidity 
the debt and equity capital markets have served as our primary source of financing to fund large acquisitions and other transactions 
our ability to access the debt and equity capital markets on economical terms is affected by general economic conditions  the financial markets  the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies  our operational and financial performance  the value and performance of equity and debt securities  prevailing commodity prices  and other macroeconomic factors outside of our control 
we have also engaged in asset monetization transactions as a source of financing  as market conditions have permitted 
in april  we sold our assets in the dj for million  and in july we completed the sale of our e 
texas natural gas gathering system for million 
as we pursue profitable reserves and production growth  we continually monitor the capital resources  including the issuance of equity and debt securities  available to us to meet our future financial obligations  planned capital expenditure activity and liquidity 
at december   we had a working capital deficit of approximately million 
we generally maintain a working capital deficit because we use excess cash to reduce outstanding borrowings under our credit facility 
our working capital fluctuates for various reasons  including changes in the fair value of our commodity derivative instruments 
changes in the market prices for oil and natural gas directly impact our level of cash flow generated from operations 
we employ derivative instruments in our risk management strategy in an attempt to minimize the adverse effects of wide fluctuations in the commodity prices on our cash flows 
as of december   we had hedged approximately and of our expected oil production in and in the form of swaps and collars 
this level of derivatives is expected to provide a measure of certainty of the cash flows that we will receive for a portion of our production in and in the future  we may increase or decrease our derivative positions 
at december   all of our derivatives counterparties were commercial banks that are parties  or affiliates of parties  to our credit facility

to the extent net cash provided by operating activities is higher or lower than currently anticipated  we may adjust our capital budget accordingly or adjust borrowings under our credit facility  as needed 
substantially all of our capital expenditure budget is directed towards our oil assets  targeting oil production growth of approximately 
although we have no specific budget for property acquisitions in  we will continue to selectively pursue property acquisitions that complement our existing core property base 
we believe that  should attractive acquisition opportunities be presented  we will be able to finance additional capital expenditures with cash flows from operating activities  borrowings under our credit facility  issuances of additional debt or equity  or agreements with industry partners

critical accounting policies and estimates for a more detailed discussion of the nature of the accounting estimates involved in estimating asset retirement obligations 
operating leases relate primarily to obligations associated with our office facilities  equipment  vehicles and aircraft 
other commitments relate primarily to natural gas purchases  cogeneration facility management services and equipment rentals 
we currently have four drilling rigs under contract that require minimum payments for the full contract term or penalties upon early termination 
all these drilling rig contracts expire in contracts for all other rigs performing work for us at december  were on a well by well basis and could be released without penalty at the conclusion of drilling on the current well  and therefore have not been included in the table above 
we enter into certain firm commitments to transport natural gas production to market and to transport natural gas for use in our cogeneration and conventional steam generation facilities 
these commitments generally require a minimum monthly charge regardless of whether the contracted capacity is used or not 
these commitments include a transportation agreement with questar pipeline company for an average of  mmbtu d of firm transportation over a period of eight years  based on the expectation that the expansion of the chipeta processing llc natural gas plant will be completed and transportation under this contract will begin july  derivative liabilities represent the fair value of our derivatives presented as net liabilities in our balance sheets as of december  these amounts represent open commodity derivative instruments that were in a net liability position with the counterparty at december  our remaining commodity derivative instruments were in a net asset position with the counterparty at december  the ultimate settlement amounts of our derivative liabilities are unknown because they are subject to continuing market fluctuations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for further details concerning our hedging activities 
based on current oil and natural gas prices and anticipated levels of production  we believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to execute our business plans over the next months and for the foreseeable future 
in addition  with our expected cash flow streams  commodity price hedging strategies  current liquidity levels  access to debt and equity markets and flexibility to modify future capital expenditure programs  we expect to be able to fund all planned capital programs  dividend distributions and debt repayments  while complying with our debt covenants and meeting any other obligations that may arise from our oil and natural gas operations 
however  if our revenue and cash flow decrease in the future as a result of a deterioration in domestic and global economic conditions or a significant decline in commodity prices  we may elect to reduce our planned capital expenditures 
we believe that this financial flexibility to adjust our spending levels will provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our financial obligations 
see part i  item a risk factors  for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties that affect our financial condition  results of operation  and operating cash flows 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and to disclose contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may vary from our estimates due to changes in circumstances  weather  politics  global economics  mechanical problems  general business conditions and other factors 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is detailed in note to our financial statements 
we have outlined below certain of these policies as being of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and which require the application of significant judgment by management 

table of contents successful efforts method of accounting 
we account for our oil and natural gas exploration and development costs using the successful efforts method 
geological and geophysical costs are expensed as incurred 
exploratory well costs are capitalized pending further evaluation of whether economically recoverable reserves have been found 
if economically recoverable reserves are not found  exploratory well costs are expensed as dry holes 
all exploratory wells are evaluated for economic viability within one year of well completion 
exploratory wells that discover potentially economic reserves that are in areas where a major capital expenditure would be required before production could begin  and where the economic viability of that major capital expenditure depends upon the successful completion of further exploratory work in the area  remain capitalized as long as the additional exploratory work is under way or firmly planned 
the costs of development wells are capitalized whether productive or nonproductive 
impairment of oil and natural gas properties 
proved oil and natural gas properties are reviewed for impairment on a field by field basis  annually or when events and circumstances indicate a possible decline in the recoverability of the carrying amount of such property 
we estimate the expected future cash flows of our oil and natural gas properties and compare these undiscounted cash flows to the carrying amount of the oil and natural gas properties to determine if the carrying amount is recoverable 
if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows  we will write down the carrying amount of the oil and natural gas properties to fair value 
the factors used to determine fair value include  but are not limited to  estimates of reserves  future commodity prices  future production estimates  estimated future capital expenditures  and discount rates commensurate with the risk associated with realizing the projected cash flows 
due to the impact of lower natural gas prices  we recorded an impairment of million related to our e 
texas natural gas assets 
see notes and to the financial statements 
unproved oil and natural gas properties are periodically assessed for impairment on a project by project basis 
the impairment assessment is affected by the results of exploration activities  commodity price outlooks  planned future sales or expiration of all or a portion of such projects 
if the quantity of potential reserves determined by such evaluations is not sufficient to fully recover the cost invested in each project  we will recognize an impairment loss at that time 
oil and natural gas reserves 
estimated proved reserves included in this annual report on form k were prepared by degolyer and macnaughton d m  an independent petroleum engineering consulting firm that has provided consulting services throughout the world for over years 
estimated proved reserves presented in this report are calculated in accordance with the sec s modernization of oil and gas reporting rule which was first effective for december  reporting 
these rules include calculating estimated proved reserves based on the average prices during the twelve month period prior to the reporting date  with such prices determined as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month prices for each month within the period  unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements  excluding escalations based upon future conditions 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves  including many factors beyond our control 
reserve engineering is a process of estimating subsurface accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner  and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and its interpretation 
as a result  estimates by different engineers often vary  sometimes significantly 
in addition to the physical factors such as the results of drilling  testing  and production subsequent to the date of an estimate  economic factors such as changes in commodity prices or development and production expenses  may require revision of such estimates 
accordingly  oil and natural gas quantities ultimately recovered will vary from reserve estimates 
see part i  item a risk factors  for a description of some of the risks and uncertainties associated with our business and reserves 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a oil and natural gas production 
the provision for dd a oil and natural gas production is calculated on a field by field basis using the unit of production method 
projected future production rates  the timing of future capital expenditures as well as changes in commodity prices  may significantly impact estimated reserve quantities 
dd a oil and natural gas production is dependent upon our estimates of total proved and proved developed reserves  which estimates incorporate various assumptions and future projections 
these estimates are subject to change as additional information and technologies become available 
accordingly  oil and natural gas quantities ultimately recovered and the timing of production may be substantially different than projected 
reduction in reserve estimates may result in increased dd a oil and natural gas production  which in turn reduces net earnings 
changes in reserve estimates are applied on a prospective basis 
such a decline in reserves may result from lower commodity prices  which may make it uneconomic to drill for and produce higher costs fields 
capitalized interest 
acquisition costs of proved undeveloped and unproved properties qualify for interest capitalization during a period if interest cost is incurred and activities necessary to bring the properties into a productive state are in progress 
as wells are drilled in a field with proved undeveloped or unproved reserves  a portion of the acquisition costs are either re 
table of contents designated as proved developed or expensed  as appropriate 
in fields with multiple potential drilling sites  we determine the amount of the acquisition cost to re designate or expense through a systematic and rational basis that considers the total expected wells to be drilled in that field 
purchase price allocations 
we occasionally acquire assets and assume liabilities in transactions accounted for as business combinations 
in connection with a purchase business combination  the acquiring company must allocate the cost of the acquisition to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on fair values as of the acquisition date 
any excess of the purchase price over amounts assigned to assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill 
any excess of amounts assigned to assets and liabilities over the purchase price is recorded as a gain on bargain purchase 
the amount of goodwill or gain on bargain purchase recorded in any particular business combination can vary significantly depending upon the value attributed to assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
in estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination  we make various assumptions 
the most significant assumptions relate to the estimated fair values assigned to proved and unproved oil and natural gas properties 
due to the unavailability of relevant comparable market data  a discounted cash flow method is used to determine the fair value of proved properties 
the discounted cash flow method estimates future cash flows based on management s expectations of future recoverable proved and risk adjusted probable reserves  commodity prices based on commodity futures price strips  production timing  drilling and production costs and a risk adjusted discount rate 
estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired can have a significant effect on results of operations in the future 
a higher fair value assigned to a property results in higher dd a oil and natural gas production  which results in lower net earnings 
fair values are based on estimates of future commodity prices  reserves quantities  operating expenses and development costs 
this increases the likelihood of impairment if future commodity prices or reserves quantities are lower than those originally used to determine fair value  or if future operating expenses or development costs are higher than those originally used to determine fair value 
derivatives and hedging 
we periodically enter into commodity derivative contracts to manage our exposure to oil and natural gas price volatility 
we also enter into derivative contracts to mitigate the risk of interest rate fluctuations 
the accounting treatment for the changes in fair value of a derivative instrument is dependent upon whether or not a derivative instrument is a cash flow hedge or a fair value hedge  and upon whether or not the derivative is designated as a hedge 
changes in fair value of a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge are recognized  to the extent the hedge is effective  in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument designated as a fair value hedge  to the extent the hedge is effective  have no effect on the statements of operations because changes in fair value of the derivative offsets changes in the fair value of the hedged item 
where hedge accounting is not elected or if a derivative instrument does not qualify as either a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge  changes in fair value are recognized in earnings 
the estimated fair value of our derivative instruments requires substantial judgment 
these values are based upon  among other things  whether or not the forecasted hedged transaction will occur  option pricing models  futures prices  volatility  and time to maturity and credit risk 
the values we report in our financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results  changes in market conditions or other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
effective january   we elected to de designate all of our commodity and interest rate contracts that had previously been designated as cash flow hedges as of december  and have elected to discontinue hedge accounting prospectively 
due to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices and interest rates  the estimated fair values of our derivative instruments are subject to large fluctuations from period to period 
see part ii  item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a sensitivity analysis of the change in net fair values of our commodity and interest rate derivatives based on a hypothetical change in commodity prices and interest rates 
income taxes and uncertain tax positions 
income taxes are recorded for the income tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements and consist of income taxes currently payable plus deferred income taxes related to certain income and expenses recognized in different periods for financial and income tax reporting purposes 
deferred income taxes are also recognized for income tax credits that are available to offset future income taxes 
deferred income taxes are measured by applying currently enacted income tax rates to the differences between the financial statements and income tax reporting 
we routinely assess the realizability of our deferred income tax assets  and a valuation allowance is recognized if it is determined that deferred income tax assets may not be fully utilized in future periods 
we consider future taxable earnings in making such assessments 
numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable earnings  including factors such as future operating conditions particularly as related to prevailing oil and natural gas prices 
there can be no assurance that facts and circumstances will not materially change and require us to establish deferred income tax asset 
table of contents valuation allowances in a future period 
we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions  and the calculation of our income tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex income tax laws and regulations in various taxing jurisdictions 
we recognize certain income tax positions that meet a more likely than not recognition threshold 
if we ultimately determine that the payment of these liabilities will be unnecessary  we will reverse the liability and recognize an income tax benefit during the period in which we determine the liability no longer applies 
asset retirement obligations 
our asset retirement obligations aros consist primarily of estimated future costs associated with the plugging and abandonment of oil and natural gas wells  removal of equipment facilities from leased acreage  and land restoration in accordance with applicable local  state and federal laws 
the discounted fair value of an aro liability is required to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred  with the associated asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying cost of the oil and natural gas asset 
the recognition of the aro requires that management make numerous assumptions regarding such factors as the estimated probabilities  amounts and timing of settlements  the credit adjusted risk free rate to be used  inflation rates  and future advances in technology 
in periods subsequent to the initial measurement of the aro  we must recognize period to period changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time and revisions to either the timing or the amount of the original estimate of undiscounted cash flows 
increases in the aro liability due to the passage of time impact net earnings as accretion expense 
the related capital cost  including revisions thereto  is charged to expense through dd a oil and natural gas over the life of the oil and natural gas field 
environmental remediation liability 
we review  on a quarterly basis  our estimates of costs of the cleanup of various sites including sites in which governmental agencies have designated us as a potentially responsible party 
when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and where a minimum cost or a reasonable estimate of the cost of remediation can be determined  the applicable amount is accrued 
determining when expenses should be recorded for these contingencies and the appropriate amounts for accrual is an estimation process that includes the judgment of management 
in many cases  management s judgment is based on the advice and opinions of legal counsel and other advisers  and the interpretation of laws and regulations  which can be interpreted differently by regulators or courts of law 
our experience and the experience of other companies in dealing with similar matters influence the decision of management as to how it intends to respond to a particular matter 
a change in estimate could impact our oil and natural gas operating costs and the liability  if applicable  recorded on our balance sheets 
electricity cost allocation 
our investment in our cogeneration facilities has been for the express purpose of lowering steam costs in our california heavy oil operations and securing operating control of the respective steam generation 
such cogeneration operations produce electricity and steam and use natural gas as fuel 
we allocate steam costs to our oil and natural gas operating costs based on the conversion efficiency of fuel to electricity and steam of the cogeneration facilities plus certain direct costs in producing steam 
electricity revenue represents sales to the utilities 
a portion of the capital costs of the cogeneration facilities is allocated to dd a oil and natural gas production

table of contents reconciliation of non gaap measures discretionary cash flow 
discretionary cash flow consists of cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital items 
management uses discretionary cash flow as a measure of liquidity and believes it provides useful information to investors because it assesses cash flow from operations for each period before changes in working capital  which fluctuates due to the timing of collections of receivables and the settlements of liabilities 
the following table provides a reconciliation of discretionary cash flow to cash provided by operating activities  the most directly comparable gaap measure  for the period presented 
year ended december in millions net cash provided by operating activities add back net increase decrease in current assets add back net decrease increase in current liabilities including book overdraft add back unwind interest swap payments add back recovery of flying j bad debt discretionary cash flow operating margin per boe 
operating margin per barrel consists of oil and natural gas revenues less oil and natural gas operating expenses and production taxes divided by the total barrels sold during the period 
management uses operating margin per barrel as a measure of profitability and believes it provides useful information to investors because it relates our oil and natural gas revenue and oil and natural gas operating expenses to our total units of production providing a gross margin per unit of production  allowing investors to evaluate how our profitability varies on a per unit basis each period 
year ended december per boe average sales price including cash derivative settlements average operating costs oil and natural gas production average production taxes average operating margin pre tax pv pre tax pv is defined as standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows before the effect of income taxes 
we present pre tax pv because it is a widely used industry standard which management believes is useful when comparing our asset base and performance to other comparable oil and natural gas exploration and production companies 
the following table reconciles pre tax pv to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows year ended december  in thousands standardized measure of oil and gas discounted future cash flow from income taxes discounted future net cash flow before income taxes 
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk relates to the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production 
historically the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future 
we use various derivative instruments to manage our exposure to commodity price risk 
all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
if a derivative instrument does not qualify for hedge accounting or we do not elect to use hedge accounting  the changes in fair value  both realized and unrealized  are recorded as unrealized gains or losses in realized and unrealized gain loss on derivatives  net in our statements of operations 
cash flows from operating activities are impacted to the extent that actual cash settlements under these derivative instruments result in payments to or from the counterparty  and such cash settlement gains and losses are recorded under realized and unrealized gain loss on derivatives  net in our statements of operations 
see notes and to the financial statements 
we do not have any current derivative instruments for which we have elected hedge accounting 
currently  our derivative instruments are in the form of swaps and collars 
however  we may use a variety of derivative instruments in the future to hedge wti or other index prices 
a two way collar is a combination of options  a sold call and purchased put 
the purchased put establishes a minimum price floor and the sold call establishes a maximum price ceiling we will receive for the volumes under contract 
a three way collar is a combination of options  a sold call  a purchased put and a sold put 
the purchased put establishes a minimum price unless the market price falls below the sold put  at which point the minimum price would be nymex plus the difference between the purchased put and the sold put strike price 
the sold call establishes a maximum price the ceiling we will receive for the volumes under contract 
we utilize costless collars which are options positions by which the proceeds from the sale of the call option fund the purchase of a put option 
a hypothetical increase in the oil prices used and increase in the natural gas prices used to calculate the fair values of our derivative instruments at december  would decrease the respective fair value of crude oil and natural gas derivative instruments at december  by million and million  respectively 
a hypothetical decrease in oil prices and a decrease in natural gas prices used to calculate the fair values of our derivative instruments at december  would increase the respective fair value of oil and natural gas derivative instruments at december  by million and million  respectively 
as our natural gas production continues to decrease and our use of natural gas for steaming operations increase  we may become a net consumer of natural gas and may enter into derivative instruments to limit our exposure to future increases in natural gas prices

these derivative contracts protect  boe d of our permian sales volumes and have differentials of to during and to during 
table of contents interest rate risk market risk is estimated as the change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical basis point change in the interest rate on the outstanding balance under our credit facility 
our credit facility allows us to fix the interest rate for all or a portion of the principal balance for a period up to months 
to the extent the interest rate is fixed  interest rate changes affect the instrument s fair market value but do not impact results of operations or cash flows 
conversely  for the portion of the credit facility that has a floating interest rate  interest rate changes will not affect the fair market value but will impact future results of operations and cash flows 
changes in interest rates do not affect the amount of interest we pay on our fixed rate debt 
at december   our outstanding principal balance under our credit facility was million and the weighted average interest rate on the outstanding principal balance was 
at december   the carrying amount approximated fair market value 
assuming a constant debt level of billion  the cash flow impact resulting from a basis point change in interest rates during periods when the interest rate is not fixed would be million over a month time period
