compared with segment analysis mattress fabrics segment net sales net sales were million for fiscal  an increase of compared with million for fiscal the million in net sales represents the highest annual net sales in our history 
also  net sales were million in the fourth quarter of fiscal  an increase of compared with million in the fourth quarter of fiscal this increase in net sales was primarily due to improved industry demand and our sales and marketing initiatives 
we have been able to respond to this increased demand as we are benefitting from our recent investments in production facilities that have expanded our internal capacity 
the bedding industry is evolving into a more decorative business with increased product diversity and growing consumer demand for better bedding and a higher quality mattress fabric 
our expanded manufacturing platform has allowed us to better serve our customers by providing them with a diverse product line in all major product categories 
this product diversity  along with our design capabilities  has created additional sales opportunities with customers who are leading suppliers in the bedding industry 
as a result  we experienced sales gains across all major product categories in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in net sales also reflects price increases we implemented starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal to partially offset the increased raw material costs noted below 
sales and marketing initiatives in order to expand our product offerings and keep pace with the changing customer demand trends within the bedding industry  we entered into a joint product development  sales and marketing agreement with a 
lava son co 
lava on may  this agreement forms a new business named culp lava applied sewn solutions and will provide us the opportunity to enter the business of designing  producing  and marketing sewn mattress covers 
as we enter the business of sewn mattress covers  we will be able to leverage our design capabilities and expand our product offerings from mattress fabrics to finished covers 
in connection with this agreement  lava will provide us with technical assistance and know how for the start up of the business and will work with us on the design  sales and marketing of sewn mattress covers 
as part of the agreement  the new business will be fully funded and owned by us 
we plan to establish a manufacturing facility located in the southeastern us that will be selected by us 
as a result  we will have two mirrored manufacturing facilities to better serve our customer base and meet current and expected demand trends in the bedding industry 
we will have responsibility for all operating control of the new business  including capital expenditures and production and operating costs 
we are projecting capital expenditures to start the business to be approximately  for fiscal  as sewn products are a different business than our current normal operations and do not require large investments in plant and equipment 
lava is not required to invest capital into the company 
we are expecting production to start in the second quarter of fiscal with approximately employees 
our plan is to let the market dictate our growth strategy and we feel it is important to enter this business gradually to protect our investment as we learn what types of products and volume meet demand trends

in the third quarter of fiscal  we established a wholly owned subsidiary called culp europe in poland  and we continued to make progress in the development of this operation in fiscal we have been encouraged by the initial response from several of the largest furniture manufacturers and retailers in europe 
during fiscal  culp europe accounted for of our total upholstery fabric net sales  and we expect this percentage to increase further over the next fiscal year 
while we experienced a small operating loss for this operation during fiscal due to start up costs  we expect this subsidiary to be more profitable in fiscal also  we are pleased with the sales and profit improvement during the fourth quarter of fiscal from our us operation  with increased demand for both velvet and woven texture fabrics 
we have struggled for several years with declining sales and low profitability with this operation 
however  we felt it was strategically important to keep one us upholstery fabric operation 
our actions in the second quarter of fiscal to align our us capacity with expected demand and increase prices had a favorable impact on profitability 
we reported net sales of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal from our us operation  an increase of from million in the second quarter of fiscal we are also encouraged by new placements with our us produced fabrics and are expecting future sales growth and profitability in the first quarter of fiscal we are cautiously optimistic about our long term prospects with this operation

interest expense income interest expense was  for fiscal compared with  for fiscal this trend reflects lower outstanding balances on our long term debt 
interest income was  in fiscal compared with  for fiscal our increase in interest income is primarily due to a higher rate of return on increased short term investment balances throughout fiscal compared to fiscal other expense other expense was  for fiscal compared with  for fiscal this increase reflects fluctuations in the foreign exchange rate for our subsidiaries domiciled in canada  china  and poland 
we have been able to reduce these expenses through maintenance of a natural hedge by keeping a balance of our assets and liabilities denominated in canadian dollars during fiscal although we will continue to try to maintain this natural hedge  there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so in future reporting periods 
income taxes significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we account for income taxes using the asset and liability approach as prescribed by asc topic  income taxes 
this approach requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or income tax returns 
using the enacted tax rates in effect for the fiscal year in which differences are expected to reverse  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between financial reporting and tax basis of an asset or liability 
if a change in the effective tax rate to be applied to a timing difference is determined to be appropriate  it will affect the provision for income taxes during the period that the determination is made

deferred income taxes valuation allowance summary in accordance with asc topic  we evaluate our deferred income taxes to determine if a valuation allowance is required 
asc topic requires that companies assess whether a valuation allowance should be established based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard with significant weight being given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
since the company operates in multiple jurisdictions  we assess the need for a valuation allowance on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis  taking into account the effects of local tax law 
based on this assessment  we recorded a partial valuation allowance of million and million against our net deferred tax assets associated with our us operations at april  and may   respectively 
at april  and may   no valuation allowance was recorded against our net deferred tax assets associated with our operations located in china and poland 
united states our net deferred tax asset regarding our us operations primarily pertain to incurring significant us pre tax losses during previous years  with us loss carryforwards totaling million and million at april  and may   respectively 
fiscal due to the favorable results of our multi year restructuring process in our upholstery fabric operations and key acquisitions and capital investments made for our mattress fabric segment  on a cumulative three year basis ending may   our us operations earned a pre tax income of million 
in addition  our us operations reported a pre tax income over fiscal years and totaling million 
we believe that fiscal years and are a more indicative measure of future pre tax income as these fiscal years reflect operating performance after the cost savings of the profit improvement and restructuring plans were realized and the full operational effects of the acquisitions associated with the company s mattress fabric operations located in the us although the financial results of our us operations improved  the significant uncertainty in the overall economic climate made it very difficult to forecast medium and long term financial results associated with our us operations 
based on these economic conditions  we believed it was too uncertain to project pre tax income associated with our us operations after fiscal based on this significant positive and negative evidence  we recorded a partial valuation allowance of million against our net deferred tax assets associated with our us operations that was expected to reverse beyond fiscal and we recognized an income tax benefit of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal for the reduction in this valuation allowance for projected us taxable income in fiscal that was expected to reduce our us loss carryforwards 
fiscal this improvement in the us operations financial results continued through fiscal our us operations earned a cumulative pretax income through the second quarter of fiscal and fiscal years and totaling million 
this continued earnings improvement from our us operations was driven by our mattress fabrics operations which primarily resides in the us during the second quarter of fiscal  our mattress fabrics operations had net sales totaling million compared with million in the second quarter of fiscal in addition  our mattress fabrics operations had operating income totaling million in the second quarter of fiscal compared with million in the second quarter of fiscal these improved results in the second quarter of fiscal  which were better than expected  can be attributed to increased sales from our sales and marketing initiatives and new programs with customers who are leading suppliers in the bedding industry 
collectively these developments increased our confidence in forecasting us taxable income through fiscal in the second quarter of fiscal although our us operations financial results continued to improve through the second quarter of fiscal  the significant uncertainty in the overall economic climate also continued 
as a result  to forecast medium and long term financial results associated with our us operations remained difficult 
since it will take a significant period of time for our us operations to realize its us net deferred income tax assets based on earned and forecasted us pre tax income levels  we believe it was too uncertain to project us pre tax income levels associated with our us operations after fiscal that support a more likely than not assertion at the end of our second quarter of fiscal these trends continued through the fourth quarter of fiscal and  as a result  we maintain our position that we can forecast us taxable income through fiscal our mattress fabric operations had net sales totaling million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal in addition our mattress fabric operations reported operating income of million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal based on this positive and negative evidence noted above  we recorded a partial valuation allowance of million at april   against the net deferred tax assets associated with our us operations that are expected to reverse beyond fiscal accordingly  we recognized an income tax benefit of million in the second quarter of fiscal for the reduction in this valuation allowance for estimated us taxable income in fiscal years and that is expected reduce our us loss carryfowards 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we booked an income tax charge of  due to a change in our estimate of us taxable income in fiscal years and that was made in the second quarter of fiscal china our net deferred tax asset regarding our china operations primarily pertains to the book versus tax basis difference associated with our china operation s fixed assets 
this book versus tax basis difference resulted from our impairment losses and fixed asset write downs associated with our september upholstery fabrics restructuring plan 
in order for this net deferred tax asset to have been realized  our china operations must have had sufficient pre tax income levels to utilize its tax over book depreciation expense 
during fiscal  management assessed both positive and negative evidence and concluded that there was sufficient positive evidence that our net deferred tax assets regarding our china operations will more likely than not be realized 
due to the favorable results from our restructuring activities and profit improvement plan initiated in the second quarter of fiscal  our china operations became profitable  reporting pre tax income of million in fiscal and fiscal in addition  our china operations earned pre tax income of million over a cumulative three year period ending may  as a result of the improvement of our china operations pre tax income levels that have been demonstrated over a cumulative period of three years  there was sufficient positive evidence that our china operations can provide sufficient pre tax income levels to utilize its tax over book depreciation expense 
based on this significant positive evidence  we do not have a valuation allowance against our china net deferred tax assets at april  and may   respectively 
during fiscal we recognized an income tax benefit of million to reduce the valuation allowance of million recorded at may  the beginning of fiscal 
income taxes paid although we reported income tax expense of  in fiscal and an income tax benefit of million in fiscal  we pay income taxes associated with our subsidiaries in china and canada

our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balance may be adversely affected by factors beyond our control  such as weakening industry demand and delays in receipt of payment on accounts receivable

commitments the following table summarizes our contractual payment obligations and commitments for each of the next five fiscal years in thousands thereafter total capital expenditures accounts payable capital expenditures operating leases interest expense line of credit long term debt principal total note payment obligations by end of each fiscal year interest expense includes interest incurred on long term debt and line of credit 
at april   the company had million of total gross unrecognized tax benefits  of which million and million were classified as net non current deferred income taxes and income taxes payable long term  respectively 
the final outcome of these tax uncertainties is dependent upon various matters including tax examinations  legal proceedings  competent authority proceedings  changes in regulatory tax laws  or interpretations of those tax laws  or expiration of statutes of limitation 
as a result of these inherent uncertainties  the company cannot reasonably estimate the timing of payment of these amounts 
of the million in total gross unrecognized tax benefits  million would not be subject to cash payments due to the company s us federal and state net operating loss carryforwards 
capital expenditures capital expenditures on a cash basis were million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
these capital expenditures for fiscal and primarily pertain to our mattress fabrics segment 
depreciation expense was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
depreciation expense for fiscal and primarily pertained to our mattress fabrics segment 
we are currently planning for capital expenditures of million in fiscal  which primarily pertain to our mattress fabrics segment 
for fiscal  we are estimating capital expenditures and depreciation expense for the company as a whole to be million and million  respectively 
the estimated capital expenditures and depreciation expense primarily relates to the mattress fabrics segment 
these are management s current expectations only  and changes in our business needs could cause changes in plans for capital expenditures and expectations for related depreciation expense 
accounts payable capital expenditures at april   we had total amounts due regarding capital expenditures totaling  which pertain to outstanding vendor invoices  none of which are financed 
this amount due of  is required to be paid in full during fiscal inflation any significant increase in our raw material costs  utility energy costs and general economic inflation could have a material adverse impact on the company  because competitive conditions have limited our ability to pass significant operating increases on to customers 
as discussed elsewhere in this report see segment analysis  significant increases in raw material costs led to lower profit margins for both of our business segments during fiscal years and critical accounting policies us generally accepted accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
some of these estimates require difficult  subjective and or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain  and as a result actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
due to the estimation processes involved  management considers the following summarized accounting policies and their application to be critical to understanding the company s business operations  financial condition and results of operations 
accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts 
substantially all of our accounts receivable are due from residential and commercial furniture and bedding manufacturers 
ownership of these manufacturers is increasingly concentrated and certain bedding manufacturers have a high degree of leverage 
as of april   accounts receivable from furniture manufacturers totaled approximately million  and accounts receivable from bedding manufacturers totaled approximately million 
additionally  as of april   the aggregate accounts receivable balance of the company s ten largest customers was million  or of trade accounts receivable 
one customer within the upholstery fabrics segment represented of consolidated accounts receivable at april  no customers within the mattress fabrics segment represented more than of consolidated accounts receivable at april  we continuously perform credit evaluations of our customers  considering numerous inputs including customers financial position  past payment history  cash flows and management capability  historical loss experience  and economic conditions and prospects 
once evaluated  each customer is assigned a credit grade 
credit grades are adjusted as warranted 
significant management judgment and estimates must be used in connection with establishing the reserve for allowance for doubtful accounts 
while management believes that adequate allowances for doubtful accounts have been provided in the consolidated financial statements  it is possible that we could experience additional unexpected credit losses 
the reserve balance for doubtful accounts was  and  at april  and may   respectively 
inventory valuation 
we operate as a make to order and make to stock business 
although management closely monitors demand in each product area to decide which patterns and styles to hold in inventory  the increasing availability of low cost imports and the gradual shifts in consumer preferences expose the company to markdowns of inventory 
management continually examines inventory to determine if there are indicators that the carrying value exceeds its net realizable value 
experience has shown that the most significant indicator of the need for inventory markdowns is the age of the inventory and the planned discontinuance of certain patterns 
as a result  the company provides inventory valuation markdowns based upon set percentages for inventory aging categories  generally using six  nine  twelve and fifteen month categories 
we also provide inventory valuation write downs based on the planned discontinuance of certain products based on the current market values at that time as compared to their current carrying values 
while management believes that adequate markdowns for excess and obsolete inventory have been made in the consolidated financial statements  significant unanticipated changes in demand or changes in consumer tastes and preferences could result in additional excess and obsolete inventory in the future 
the reserve for inventory markdowns was million and million at april  and may   respectively 
goodwill 
management assesses goodwill for impairment at the end of each fiscal year or between annual tests if an event that occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying values 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we early adopted asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other asc topic testing goodwill for impairment when we performed our annual impairment test 
asu no 
provides companies with a new option to determine whether or not it is necessary to apply the traditional two step quantitative goodwill impairment test in asc topic under asu no 
 companies are no longer required to calculate the fair value of the reporting unit mattress fabrics segment unless it determines  on the basis of qualitative information  that it is more likely than not ie greater than that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
based on our qualitative assessment  we determined that our goodwill is not impaired using a more likely than not standard 
the company s goodwill at april   of million relates to the mattress fabrics segment 
although we believe we have based the impairment testing on reasonable estimates and assumptions  the use of different estimates and assumptions could result in materially different results 
income taxes 
income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of the company s assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards at income tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are realized or settled 
the effect on deferred income taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income loss in the period that includes the enactment date 
in accordance with asc topic  we evaluate our deferred income taxes to determine if a valuation allowance is required 
asc topic requires that companies assess whether a valuation allowance should be established based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard with significant weight being given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
since the company operates in multiple jurisdictions  we assess the need for a valuation allowance on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis  taking into account the effects of local tax law 
based on this assessment  we recorded a partial valuation allowance of million and million against our net deferred tax assets associated with our us operations at april  and may   respectively 
at april  and may   no valuation allowance was recorded against our net deferred tax assets associated with our operations located in china and poland 
refer to note located in the notes to the consolidated statements for disclosures regarding our assessment of our recorded valuation allowance as of april  and may   respectively 
in accordance with asc topic  we must recognize the tax impact from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax impact recognized in the financial statements from such a position is measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
penalties and interest related to uncertain tax positions are recorded as tax expense 
significant judgment is required in the identification of uncertain tax positions and in the estimation of penalties and interest on uncertain tax positions 
at april   we had million of total gross unrecognized tax benefits  of which million and million were classified as net non current deferred income taxes and income taxes payable long term  respectively  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
adoption of new accounting pronouncements refer to note located in the notes to the consolidated statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements for fiscal recently issued accounting standards refer to note located in the notes to the consolidated statements for recently issued accounting pronouncements for fiscal item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our revolving credit lines 
at april   our us revolving credit agreement provides for a pricing matrix to determine the interest rate payable on loans made under this agreement 
our revolving credit line associated with our china subsidiaries bears interest at a rate determined by the chinese government 
at april   there were no borrowings outstanding under our us and china revolving credit lines 
on january   we entered into an unsecured credit agreement associated with our operations located in poland that bears interest at wibor warsaw interbank offered rate plus 
at april    was outstanding under this agreement and this amount is required to be paid in full by january   when this agreement expires 
we are not exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our long term debt 
our unsecured term notes have a fixed interest rate of and the loan associated with the government of quebec is non interest bearing 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in the value of foreign currencies for our subsidiaries domiciled in china  canada  and poland 
we try to maintain a natural hedge by keeping a balance of our assets and liabilities denominated in the local currencies of our subsidiaries domiciled in canada and europe  although there is no assurance that we will be able to continually maintain this natural hedge 
our foreign subsidiaries use the us dollars as their functional currency 
a substantial portion of the company s imports purchased outside the us are denominated in us dollars 
a change in the above exchange rates at april   would not have had a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position
