item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents patents and proprietary rights we rely in part on patents  trade secrets and know how to develop and maintain our competitive position and technological advantage  particularly with respect to our launch vehicle and satellite products 
while our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to the operation of our business  we do not believe that any single existing patent or other intellectual property right is of such importance that its loss or termination would have a material adverse effect on our business  taken as a whole 
components and raw materials  seasonality we purchase a significant percentage of our subassemblies and instruments from domestic and foreign suppliers 
we also obtain from the us government parts and equipment that are used in the production of our products or in the provision of our services 
generally  we have not experienced material difficulty in obtaining product components or necessary parts and equipment and we believe that alternatives to our existing sources of supply are available  although we could incur increased costs and possible delays in securing alternative sources of supply 
we rely upon sole source suppliers for most solid propellant rocket motors and liquid propellant rocket engines used on our launch vehicles 
while we believe that alternative sources for rocket motors and engines would be available  the inability of our current suppliers to provide us with rocket motors and engines could result in significant program delays  expenses and loss of revenues 
our business is not seasonal 
us government contracts during  and  approximately  and  respectively  of our total annual revenues were derived from contracts with the us government and its agencies or from subcontracts with other us government contractors 
most of our us government contracts are funded incrementally on a year to year basis 
our major contracts with the us government primarily fall into two categories cost reimbursable contracts and fixed price contracts 
approximately and of our revenues from us government contracts in were derived from cost reimbursable contracts and fixed price contracts  respectively 
under cost reimbursable contracts  we recover our actual allowable costs incurred  allocable indirect costs and a fee consisting of i a base amount that is fixed at the inception of the contract and or ii an award amount that is based on the customer s evaluation of our performance in terms of the criteria stated in the contract 
our fixed price contracts include firm fixed price and fixed price incentive fee contracts 
under firm fixed price contracts  work performed and products shipped are paid for at a fixed price without adjustment for actual costs incurred in connection with the contract 
therefore  we bear the risk of loss if costs increase  although some of this risk may be passed on to subcontractors 
fixed price incentive fee contracts provide for sharing by us and the customer of unexpected costs incurred or savings realized within specified limits  and may provide for adjustments in price depending on actual contract performance other than costs 
costs in excess of the negotiated maximum 
table of contents ceiling price and the risk of loss by reason of such excess costs are borne by us  although some of this risk may be passed on to subcontractors 
as noted above  we derive a significant portion of our revenues from us government contracts  which are dependent on continued political support and funding 
all our us government contracts and  in general  our subcontracts with other us government prime contractors provide that such contracts may be terminated for convenience at any time by the us government or the prime contractor  respectively 
furthermore  any of these contracts may become subject to a government issued stop work order under which we would be required to suspend production 
in the event of a termination for convenience  contractors generally are entitled to receive the purchase price for delivered items  reimbursement for allowable costs for work in process and an allowance for reasonable profit thereon or adjustment for loss if completion of performance would have resulted in a loss 
for a more detailed description of risks relating to the us government contract industry  see item a risk factors 
a portion of our business is classified for national security purposes by the us government and cannot be specifically described 
the operating results of these classified programs are included in our consolidated financial statements 
the business risks associated with classified programs  as a general matter  do not differ materially from those of our other us government contracts 
regulation our ability to pursue our business activities is regulated by various agencies and departments of the us government and  in certain circumstances  the governments of other countries 
commercial space launches require licenses from the us department of transportation dot and the reentry of our cygnus maneuvering spacecraft during the cots demonstration mission and the operation of our l aircraft require licenses from certain agencies of the dot  including the federal aviation administration 
launches of our antares rocket  which will use modified russian rocket engines  require a russian government license  which we have obtained 
the federal communications commission fcc also requires licenses for radio communications during our rocket launches 
our classified programs require that we and certain of our employees maintain appropriate security clearances 
we also require export licenses from the us department of state dos  the us department of commerce doc and  occasionally  the governments of other countries with respect to transactions we have with foreign customers or foreign subcontractors 
contract backlog our firm backlog was approximately billion at december  and approximately billion at december  while there can be no assurance  we expect to convert approximately billion of the year end firm backlog into revenues during our firm backlog as of december  included approximately billion of contracts with the us government and its agencies or from subcontracts with prime contractors of the us government 
most of our us government contracts are funded incrementally on a year to year basis 
firm backlog from us government contracts at december  included total 
table of contents funded orders of about million and orders not yet funded of about billion 
changes in government policies  priorities or funding levels through agency or program budget reductions by the us congress or executive agencies could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  contracts with the us government may be terminated or suspended by the us government at any time  with or without cause  which could result in a reduction in backlog 
total backlog was approximately billion at december  total backlog includes firm backlog in addition to unexercised options  indefinite quantity contracts and undefinitized orders and contract award selections

item a 
risk factors investors should carefully consider  among other factors  the risks listed below 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues from us government contracts  which are dependent on continued political support and funding and are subject to termination by the us government at any time 
the majority of our total annual revenues and our firm backlog at december  was derived from us government contracts 
most of our us government contracts are funded incrementally on a year to year basis and are subject to uncertain future funding levels 
our direct and indirect contracts with the us government may be terminated or suspended by the us government or its prime contractors at any time  with or without cause 
termination or suspension of any of our significant us government contracts could result in the loss of future revenues and unreimbursable expenses or charges that could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  key human space initiatives  missile defense programs  and other space programs must compete with other programs for consideration during the federal budgeting and appropriation process  and support and funding for any us government program may be influenced by general economic conditions  political considerations and other factors 
a decline in us government support and funding for programs in which we participate could result in contract terminations  delays in contract awards  the failure to exercise contract options  the cancellation of planned procurements and fewer new business opportunities  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we are subject to a number of domestic and international laws  regulations and restrictions  the non compliance with which may expose us to adverse consequences 
as a government contractor  we are subject to extensive and complex us government procurement laws and regulations  including the procurement integrity act and the false claims act 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in contract termination  price or fee reductions  civil or criminal penalties  injunctions and or administrative sanctions such as suspension or debarment from contracting with the us government 
in addition  our international business subjects us to numerous us and foreign laws and regulations  including the foreign corrupt practices act and regulations relating to import export control 
our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative  civil or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions such as suspension or debarment from contracting with the us government or suspension of our export privileges 
our business could be adversely affected by adverse audit findings by the us government 
us government agencies  including the defense contract audit agency and various agency inspectors general  routinely audit and investigate government contractors 
these agencies review a contractor s performance under its contracts  cost structure and compliance with applicable laws  regulations and standards 
charging practices relating to labor  research and development  and other costs that may be charged directly or indirectly to us government contracts are often scrutinized to determine that such costs are allowable under us government contracts and furthermore that such costs are reasonable 
any costs determined to be unallowable or unreasonable may not be reimbursed  and such costs already reimbursed may be subject to repayment 
if the amount of such costs were significant  our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
for example  we expect to recover a significant portion of our research and development expenses  including those related to the antares development program  through billings under certain of our government contracts in accordance with applicable regulations  but we cannot assure you that this will occur 
our inability to recover a significant portion of such expenses could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
the above mentioned agencies also review the adequacy of  and a contractor s compliance with  its internal control systems and policies  including the contractor s purchasing  property  estimating  compensation  accounting and information systems 
adverse findings relating to our systems could result in the us government customer withholding a percentage of payments and also could impact our ability to win new us government contract awards or option exercises 
responding to government audits  inquiries or investigations may involve significant expense and divert management attention 
also  if an audit or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities  we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  including termination of contracts  forfeiture of profits  suspension of payments  fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the us government 
in addition  we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were to be made against us 

table of contents termination of our contracts could materially adversely affect our backlog and our future financial results 
approximately of our revenues were derived from direct or indirect contracts with the us government 
all of our direct and indirect contracts with the us government or its prime contractors may be terminated or suspended at any time  with or without cause  for the convenience of the government 
us government contract awards also may be subject to bid protests  which may result in a contract award being rescinded or subject to reprocurement 
in addition  our commercial satellite contracts also give the customer the right to unilaterally terminate the contract 
for these reasons  we cannot assure you that all of our backlog will ultimately be recognized in revenues 
the loss of future revenue  incurrence of unreimbursed costs  or liability to the us government or our commercial customers in connection with other cancelled or rescinded contracts could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  the termination of any contracts for default also could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain new business in the future 
we are dependent on a single us government contract for a large percentage of our revenues and backlog 
our crs contract to deliver cargo to the international space station iss accounted for approximately of our revenues in  and we expect it to continue to account for a material percentage of our revenues in given the uncertainty surrounding future government spending and the right of us government customers to terminate our contracts for convenience  there can be no assurance that the current backlog for this contract ultimately will be recognized in revenues 
the cancellation of our crs contract for any reason  including as a result of reductions in appropriations or the failure to achieve milestones due to technical issues or delays  would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the failure to achieve certain milestones related to the successful launch of our antares rocket and the successful delivery of cargo to the iss could result in a material reduction of future revenues and profit 
we use estimates in accounting for our contracts 
changes in our estimates could materially adversely affect our financial results 
contract accounting requires judgments in assessing risks  estimating contract revenues and costs and making assumptions related to schedule and technical issues 
due to the nature of many of our contracts  the estimation of total revenues and costs at completion may be complex and is subject to many variables 
for example  we make assumptions regarding our performance under contracts  the labor hours  labor rates and costs of materials and subcontracts 
our assumptions regarding the timing and amounts of incentives  penalties  award fees and milestones related to performance on contracts involve a high degree of judgment and estimates by our management 
these assumptions are important factors that impact the revenues and profits that we recognize 
in the event of a change in total estimated contract revenue  cost or profit  the cumulative effect of such change is recorded in the period the change in estimate occurs 

table of contents because of the significance of the judgments and estimates inherent in our accounting processes described above  it is possible that material adjustments to our financial results could be required if we determine  based on current facts and circumstances known to us  that our prior assumptions are no longer reasonable and need to be revised 
if the sec disagrees with our assumptions underlying our crs contract revenues recognized in  and  we may be required to reverse a portion of such revenues and we could be required to restate our financial statements for prior periods 
in december  we received a comment letter from the staff of the sec in connection with a routine review of our annual report on form k for the year ended december  and quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended september  the sec comment letter included  among other things  a request for supplemental information on certain of our accounting policies and disclosures related to the timing of revenue recognition  including for our crs contract with nasa to resupply the international space station 
we are currently engaged in discussions with the sec staff regarding our assumptions relating to the recognition of launch and delivery milestones under the crs contract 
our consolidated results contained in this annual report on form k were prepared in accordance with our existing accounting policies  using assumptions which we believe are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances  all of which are consistent with those applied in prior audited periods 
see critical accounting policies and significant estimates in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of our accounting policies and assumptions related to revenue recognition 
if the sec disagrees with our assumptions underlying our crs contract revenue recognized in  and  we may be required to reverse a portion of such revenues and we could be required to restate our financial statements for prior periods 
we also could be required to defer recognizing a portion of future crs contract revenues until and unless certain contract milestones are achieved 
the crs contract accounted for approximately  and of our revenues in  and  respectively  consequently  there is a risk that a restatement could materially reduce the amount of revenues and profit reported in those periods 
we may not receive full payment for our satellites or launch services and we could incur penalties in the event of a failure or malfunction or if our satellites are not delivered or our rockets are not launched on schedule 
some of our satellite contracts provide for performance based payments to be made to us after the satellite is in orbit over periods that may be as long as years 
additionally  some satellite contracts require us to refund cash to the customer if performance criteria  which cover periods of up to years  are not satisfied 
certain contracts include payment milestones that are 
table of contents contingent upon a successful launch 
while our practice is generally to procure insurance policies that we believe would indemnify us for satellite and launch success incentive fees or contract milestones that are not earned and for performance refund obligations  insurance may not continue to be available on economical terms  if at all 
further  we may elect not to procure insurance 
in addition  some of our satellite and launch contracts require us to pay penalties in the event that satellites are not delivered or a launch does not occur  on a timely basis  or to refund cash receipts to the customer if a contract is terminated for default 
our failure to earn performance based contract milestones  or a requirement that we refund cash to the customer or pay delay penalties  could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
contract cost overruns could materially adversely impact our financial results 
we provide our products and services primarily through cost reimbursable and fixed price contracts 
cost overruns  if significant  could materially adversely impact our financial results under cost reimbursable contracts  we are reimbursed for allowable incurred costs plus a fee  which may be fixed or variable based  entirely or in part  on the customer s evaluation of our performance under the contract 
there is no guarantee as to the amount of fee  if any  that we will be awarded under a cost reimbursable contract with a variable fee 
in addition  the price on a cost reimbursable contract is based on allowable costs incurred  but generally is subject to customer funding limitations 
if we incur costs in excess of the amount funded  we may not be able to recover such costs 
under fixed price contracts  our customers pay us for work performed and products shipped based on an agreed upon price  without adjustment for any cost overruns 
therefore  we generally bear all of the financial risk as a result of increased costs on these contracts  although some of this risk may be passed on to subcontractors 
some of our fixed price contracts provide for sharing of unexpected cost increases or savings realized within specified limits and may provide for adjustments in price depending on actual contract performance 
we bear the entire risk of cost overruns in excess of the negotiated maximum amount of unexpected costs to be shared 
our commercial contracts are generally fixed price agreements 
in addition  a significant percentage of our revenues from us government contracts over the last three years were derived from fixed price agreements  and we believe this trend will continue in future years 
our growth strategy depends on major new product development initiatives involving significant technical challenges 
we are incurring substantial expenses relating to the design and development of the antares launch vehicle 
we also are developing the cygnus advanced maneuvering spacecraft  and considering other product enhancements 
the development of new or enhanced products is a complex and uncertain process that requires the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends and can require a significant amount of time and expense to complete 
new product development programs often experience schedule delays and cost overruns 
our inability to successfully complete our new product development initiatives on schedule and 
table of contents within budget  or to obtain market acceptance  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the mid atlantic regional spaceport mars is designing and constructing a new launch site for the antares launch vehicle at nasa s wallops flight facility 
the inability of mars to complete the launch site on schedule has resulted in rescheduling of our initial antares test launch 
further delays in launch site completion could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our success depends on our ability to penetrate and retain markets for our existing products and to continue to conceive  design  manufacture and market new products on a cost effective and timely basis 
we may experience design  manufacturing  marketing and other difficulties that could delay or prevent the development  introduction or acceptance of new products and enhancements 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve the technological advances necessary to remain competitive and profitable  that new products will be developed and manufactured on schedule or on a cost effective basis or that our existing products will not become technologically obsolete 
our failure to predict accurately the needs of our customers and prospective customers  and to develop products or product enhancements that address those needs  may result in the loss of current customers or the inability to secure new customers 
there can be no assurance that our products will be successfully developed or manufactured or that they will perform as intended 
most of the products we develop and manufacture are technologically advanced and sometimes include novel systems that must function under highly demanding operating conditions 
from time to time  we experience product failures  cost overruns in developing and manufacturing our products  delays in delivery and other operational problems 
we have experienced product and service failures  schedule delays and other problems in connection with certain of our launch vehicles  satellites  advanced space systems and other products  and may have similar occurrences in the future 
some of our satellite and launch services contracts impose monetary penalties on us for delays and for performance failures  which penalties could be significant 
in addition to any costs resulting from product warranties or required remedial action  product failures or significant delays may result in increased costs or loss of revenues due to the postponement or cancellation of subsequently scheduled operations or product deliveries and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
negative publicity from product failures could damage our reputation and impair our ability to win new contracts 
if our key suppliers fail to perform as expected  we may experience delays and cost increases  and our financial results may be materially adversely impacted 
we purchase a significant percentage of our subassemblies and instruments from domestic and foreign suppliers 
we also obtain from the us government parts and equipment used in the production of our products or the provision of our services 
in addition  we rely on sole 
table of contents source suppliers for most rocket motors and engines we use on our launch vehicles  including antares 
as a result  if our suppliers fail to perform as expected or encounter financial difficulties  we may have difficulty replacing them in a timely or cost effective manner 
a supply disruption could cause significant delays that could result in substantial additional costs  a customer terminating our contract for default  or damage to our customer relationships  causing our financial results to be materially adversely impacted 
in addition  negative publicity from any failure of one of our products as a result of a failure by a key supplier could damage our reputation and limit our ability to win new contracts 
our international business is subject to risks that may have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
we sell certain of our communications satellites and other products to non us customers 
we also procure certain key product components from non us vendors 
international contracts are subject to numerous risks  including political and economic instability in foreign markets  restrictive trade policies of the us government and foreign governments  inconsistent product regulation by foreign agencies or governments  the imposition of product tariffs and burdens  the cost of complying with a variety of us and international laws and regulations  including regulations relating to import export control  and the risk of non compliance  the complexity and necessity of using non us representatives and consultants  the inability to obtain required us or foreign country export licenses  and foreign currency exposure 
such risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial results by increasing our costs  causing material delays or subjecting us to penalties 
we operate in a regulated industry  and our inability to secure or maintain the licenses  clearances or approvals necessary to operate our business could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
our ability to pursue our business activities is regulated by various agencies and departments of the us government and  in certain circumstances  the governments of other countries 
commercial space launches  the reentry of our cygnus maneuvering spacecraft during the cots demonstration and crs operational missions  and operation of our l aircraft require licenses from certain agencies of the dot  including the federal aviation administration 
launches of our antares rocket  which will use modified russian rocket engines  require a russian government license 
the fcc also requires licenses for radio communications during our rocket launches 
our classified programs require that certain of our facilities and certain of our employees maintain appropriate security clearances 
exports of our products  services and technical information generally require licenses from the dos or the doc 
in addition  exports of products from our international suppliers may require export licenses from the governments of other countries 
we have a number of 
table of contents international customers and suppliers 
our inability to secure or maintain any necessary licenses or approvals or significant delays in obtaining such licenses or approvals could negatively impact our ability to compete successfully in international markets  and could result in an event of default under certain of our international contracts 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our future efforts to secure and maintain necessary licenses  clearances or other us or foreign government regulatory approvals 
our failure to do so could prevent or delay the launch of our rockets or delivery of our other products  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we face significant competition in each of our lines of business and many of our competitors possess substantially more resources than we do 
many of our competitors are larger and have substantially greater resources than we do 
furthermore  it is possible that other domestic or foreign companies or governments  some with greater experience in the space and defense industry and many with greater financial resources than we possess  could seek to produce products or services that compete with our products or services  including new launch vehicles using new technology which could render our launch vehicles less competitively viable 
some of our domestic and foreign competitors currently benefit from  and others may benefit in the future from  subsidies from or other protective measures by their home countries 
our financial covenants may restrict our operating activities 
our credit facility contains certain financial and operating covenants  including  among other things  certain coverage ratios  as well as limitations on our ability to incur debt  make dividend payments  make investments  sell all or substantially all of our assets and engage in mergers and consolidations and certain acquisitions 
these covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain acquisition transactions 
in addition  failure to meet any of the financial covenants in our credit facility could cause an event of default under and or accelerate some or all of our indebtedness  which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the loss of our executive officers or a failure to retain other key personnel could materially adversely affect our operations 
the departure of any of our executive officers or a failure to retain other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we require experienced and highly skilled engineers and scientists  and personnel with security clearances to perform our contracts and further our business objectives 
the competition and demand for such skilled and experienced employees is great  and there can be no assurance that we will continue to attract and retain key personnel 
our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our operations by hindering our ability to execute our contracts in a timely and satisfactory manner and to obtain new business 

table of contents the anticipated benefits of future acquisitions may not be realized 
from time to time we may evaluate potential acquisitions that we believe would enhance our business 
the anticipated benefits of completed business acquisitions may not be fully realized if we are unable to successfully integrate the acquired operations  technologies and personnel into our organization 
we are subject to environmental regulation 
we are subject to various federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to the operation of our business  including those governing pollution  the handling  storage and disposal of hazardous substances and the ownership and operation of real property 
such laws and regulations may result in significant liabilities and costs 
there can be no assurance that our failure to comply with such laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our business in the future 
our restated certificate of incorporation  our amended and restated bylaws  and delaware law contain anti takeover provisions that may adversely affect the rights of our stockholders 
our charter documents contain provisions which could have an anti takeover effect  including our charter provides for a staggered board of directors as a result of which only one of the three classes of directors is elected each year  any merger  acquisition or other business combination that is not approved by our board of directors must be approved by of voting stockholders  stockholders holding less than of our outstanding voting stock cannot call a special meeting of stockholders  and stockholders must give advance notice to nominate directors or submit proposals for consideration at stockholder meetings 
in addition  we are subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which restrict the ability of current stockholders holding more than of our voting shares to acquire us without the approval of of the other stockholders 
these provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control transaction 
they could also have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our common stock 
as a result  these provisions may prevent our stock price from increasing substantially in response to actual or rumored takeover attempts 
these provisions may also prevent changes in our management 
certain repurchase rights in our convertible senior subordinated notes could discourage a potential acquirer 
we would be required to make an offer to repurchase our convertible senior subordinated notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change of our company  which 
table of contents includes a change of control in connection with a sale of the company 
this repurchase right on the part of the holders of our notes could discourage a potential acquirer 
conversion of our convertible senior subordinated notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders 
upon conversion of our convertible senior subordinated notes  we will deliver in respect of each  principal amount of notes tendered for conversion an amount in cash principal return equal to the lesser of a the principal amount of the converted notes and b the conversion value such value equal to the conversion rate multiplied by the average price of our common shares over a consecutive day trading period and if the conversion value is greater than the principal return  an amount in cash or common stock  or a combination thereof at our option with a value equal to the difference between the conversion value and the principal return 
any common stock issued upon conversion of the notes will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders 
any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 
in addition  the existence of the notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the notes could depress the price of our common stock

overview introduction orbital sciences corporation develops and manufactures small and medium class rockets and space systems for commercial  military and civil government customers 
our primary products and services include the following launch vehicles rockets that are used as small and medium class space launch vehicles that place satellites into earth orbit and escape trajectories  interceptor and target vehicles for missile defense systems and suborbital launch vehicles that place payloads into a variety of high altitude trajectories 
satellites and space systems small and medium class satellites that are used to enable global and regional communications and broadcasting  conduct space related scientific research  collect imagery and other remotely sensed data about the earth  carry out interplanetary and other deep space exploration missions and demonstrate new space technologies 
advanced space programs human rated space systems for earth orbit and deep space exploration  and small and medium class satellites primarily used for national security space programs and to demonstrate new space technologies 
our general strategy is to develop and expand a core integrated business of space and launch system technologies and products  focusing on the design and manufacture of affordable rockets  satellites and other space systems in order to establish and expand positions in niche markets that have not typically been emphasized by our larger competitors 
another part of our strategy is to seek customer contracts that will fund new product development and enhancements to our existing launch vehicle and space systems product lines 
as a result of our capabilities and experience in designing  developing  manufacturing and operating a broad range of small and medium class rockets and space systems  we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the demand for more affordable space technology systems in commercial satellite communications  space based military and intelligence operations and military defense programs  and to take 
table of contents advantage of government sponsored initiatives for human space exploration  space based scientific research and interplanetary exploration 
in april  we acquired the spacecraft development and manufacturing business of general dynamics advanced information systems  a subsidiary of general dynamics corporation  for million  as further discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements in this form k 
this acquisition further strengthened our competitive position in defense and intelligence  civil government and commercial satellite markets 
business and industry considerations us government business during  and  approximately  and  respectively  of our consolidated revenues were derived from contracts with the us government and its agencies or from subcontracts with other us government contractors 
most of our us government contracts are funded incrementally on a year to year basis 
as a result  our operations and our financial results in any period could be impacted substantially by trends in us government spending  shifting priorities in dod including mda  nasa and other agency budgets  the types of contracts and payment terms mandated by the us government and changes in the executive branch and congress 
these factors  which are largely beyond our control  could have a significant impact on our business 
we expect federal spending on space and missile defense programs to be flat or slightly lower compared to historical levels over the next couple of years 
given the political gridlock we have witnessed over the past several years regarding the federal budget  it is uncertain whether appropriations legislation for the agencies with whom we do business will be enacted and  if so  in what form 
automatic across the board cuts could be triggered under the budget control act of unless a law is enacted that provides funding direction through individual appropriation bills or an omnibus appropriation bill 
the exact manner in which this impact would be felt currently is uncertain  and as is a presidential election year  it is difficult to anticipate the direction federal budgetary policy will take in future years 
nasa continues to prioritize funding for development of us commercial cargo and crew services for the international space station 
accordingly  funding for our cots demonstration mission  including an antares test launch  and the crs contract remains on track and unaffected by budget cuts 
priorities with respect to earth and space science investigations are less clear  however 
while nasa has a number of anticipated procurements for science and exploration missions  it is difficult to predict the timing of future awards 
the majority of orbital s interceptor and target launch vehicle revenues comes from programs sponsored by mda 
due to uncertainties regarding funding and the expectation that budgets will continue to be reduced  however  several target programs have been delayed or reduced in scope and it is possible that trend will continue for the foreseeable future 
funding for mda s gmd program  on which orbital has performed as a major subcontractor  has declined over the last several years  and while mda recently awarded a follow on contract that extends through  it is funded substantially lower than historic levels 
defense priorities appear to be shifting away from long range threats toward missile systems with short and 
table of contents medium range capability 
however  we believe the capabilities of our target launch vehicle product lines could meet the requirements of a variety of national missile defense systems 
for example  in  orbital was awarded a contract by mda to supply intermediate range ballistic missile target vehicles for use in testing missile defense systems against medium range threats 
finally  budget constraints have and  we believe  will continue to impact national security space programs  resulting in program delays  cancellations or scope reductions 
dod and the intelligence community have for some missions historically relied on large multi mission space systems that are very expensive and take a long time to be deployed 
it is anticipated that they will explore ways to address their operational requirements on more limited budgets by considering smaller and more affordable space systems that can perform the missions these customers need on more economical and timely terms 
over time  we believe this may create a competitive advantage for our national security space systems product line that we believe will result in more contract awards in the future 
commercial satellites business our largest commercial business is the design and manufacture of small class geo communications satellites 
commercial communications satellites accounted for  and of our consolidated revenues in  and  respectively 
the commercial communications satellite market is driven by economic conditions that may affect satellite operators directly as well as their satellite replacement requirements 
the majority of geo communications satellites are medium class and large class satellites 
in  the total number of commercial geo satellite orders decreased for the second straight year 
the record high number of orders in reflected a surge in capital expenditures by the major commercial satellite operators that was anticipated to decline steadily 
we believe the number of satellite orders will be relatively flat for the near future as activity from regional operators and start up companies focusing on under served geographic markets offset the slowdown in expenditures by large  established operators to some extent 
we believe these smaller operators are well matched to orbital s product focus on small and medium class satellites 
critical accounting policies and significant estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments based upon estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain 
such judgments affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management continuously evaluates its estimates and assumptions  including those related to long term contracts and incentives  inventories  long lived assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation  and the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and such differences may be material 

table of contents the following is a summary of the most critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenues are derived primarily from long term contracts 
revenues on long term contracts are recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
such revenues are recorded based on the percentage that costs incurred to date bear to the most recent estimates of total costs to complete each contract 
estimating future revenues  costs and profit  is a process requiring a high degree of management judgment  including management s assumptions regarding our future operational performance as well as general economic conditions 
in the event of a change in total estimated contract revenue  cost or profit  the cumulative effect of such change is recorded in the period the change in estimate occurs 
frequently  the period of performance of a contract extends over a long period of time and  as such  revenue recognition and our profitability from a particular contract may be adversely affected to the extent that estimated costs to complete or incentive or award fee estimates are revised  delivery schedules are delayed  performance based milestones are not achieved or progress under a contract is otherwise impeded 
accordingly  our recorded revenues and operating profit from period to period can fluctuate significantly 
in the event cost estimates indicate a loss on a contract  the total amount of such loss  excluding general and administrative expense  is recorded in the period in which the loss is first estimated 
many of our contracts include provisions that increase or decrease contract value based on performance in relation to established targets or customer evaluations 
mission success milestones and incentive and award fees are included in estimated contract revenue when we are able to make reasonable predictions about whether the performance targets will be achieved and make dependable estimates of such amounts based upon our historical experience with similar types of activities and other objective criteria 
we include the estimated amount of mission success milestones and incentive and award fees in estimated contract revenue at the inception of each contract  with reassessments made each quarter throughout the period of contract performance 
if performance under such contracts were to differ from previous assumptions  or if we were to revise our estimates or assumptions  current period revenues and profit would be adjusted and could fluctuate significantly 
our assessments are guided by the historical performance of our products and product families  the reliability record of the technology employed and assessments of technological considerations for each contract 
as part of our risk management strategy  we generally insure significant mission success milestone receipts 
insurance recoveries are recorded as other income in the consolidated financial statements 
as of december  and  unbilled receivables included approximately million and million  respectively  of incentive fees on certain completed satellite contracts that become due incrementally over periods of up to years  subject to the achievement of performance criteria 
certain satellite contracts require the company to refund cash to the customer if performance criteria  which cover periods of up to years  are not satisfied 
as of december   we 
table of contents could be required to refund up to approximately million to customers if certain completed satellites were to fail to satisfy performance criteria 
we generally procure insurance policies under which we believe we would recover satellite incentive fees that are not earned and potential performance refund obligations 
mission success milestones relating to the launch of our antares rocket with its cygnus payload and the successful delivery of cargo to the iss comprise approximately of total crs contract value 
if we do not achieve these mission success milestones  we may be required to record revenue and profit reductions 
as of december   we have recognized million of revenues for this contract 
research and development expenditures for company sponsored research and development projects are expensed as incurred 
research and development projects performed under contracts for customers are recorded as contract costs 
in  we entered into the cots agreement with nasa to design  build and demonstrate a new space transportation system for delivering cargo and supplies to the iss 
the cots agreement is being accounted for as a best efforts research and development cost sharing arrangement 
as such  the amounts funded by nasa are recognized proportionally as an offset to our cots program research and development expenses  including associated general and administrative expenses 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a tax rate change on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we record valuation allowances to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount considered more likely than not to be realized 
changes in estimates of future taxable income can materially change the amount of such valuation allowances

management currently believes that available cash  cash expected to be generated from operations and the borrowing capacity under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operating and capital expenditure requirements  including research and development expenditures  over the next months and for the foreseeable future 
however  there can be no assurance that this will be the case

discussions with us securities and exchange commission in december  we received a comment letter from the staff of the us securities and exchange commission sec in connection with a routine review of our annual report on form k for the year ended december  and quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended september  the sec comment letter included  among other things  a request for supplemental information on certain of our accounting policies and disclosures related to the timing of revenue recognition  including for our crs contract with nasa to resupply cargo to the international space station

the launch and delivery milestones comprise approximately of total crs contract value 
total crs contract revenue recognized through december  is approximately million 
our consolidated results contained in this annual report on form 
table of contents k were prepared in accordance with our existing accounting policies and using assumptions which we believe are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances  all of which are consistent with those applied in prior audited periods 
until these discussions are resolved  we cannot determine if we will be required to supplement our disclosures or restate or make other changes to our historical consolidated financial statements  including the financial information contained in this annual report on form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we believe that our market risk exposure is primarily related to the market value of certain investments that we hold as of december   changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rate risk 
we manage these market risks through our normal financing and operating activities and  when appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
we do not enter into derivatives for trading or other speculative purposes  nor do we use leveraged financial instruments 
investments as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements in this form k  we currently hold investments in certain auction rate and preferred stock securities that have experienced a decline in fair value resulting in our recording certain other than temporary impairment charges 
we may be required to record additional impairment charges if there are further reductions in the fair value of these investments in future periods 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we believe that the potential change in foreign currency exchange rates is not a substantial risk to us because the large majority of our business transactions are denominated in us dollars 
at december   we had million of receivables denominated in japanese yen 
from time to time  we enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge against foreign currency fluctuations on receivables or expected payments denominated in foreign currency 
at december   we had no foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates in the normal course of our business operations as a result of our ongoing investing and financing activities  which include debt as well as cash and cash equivalents 
as of december   we had million of convertible senior subordinated notes with a fixed interest rate of 
generally  the fair market value of our fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
in addition  the fair value of our convertible notes is affected by our stock price 
the total estimated fair value of our convertible debt at december  was million 
the fair value was determined based upon market prices quoted by a broker dealer 

table of contents we believe that our exposure to market risk related to interest rate fluctuations for cash and cash equivalents is not significant 
as of december   a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates would result in an annual change of approximately million in interest income earned 
we assess our interest rate risks on a regular basis and do not currently use financial instruments to mitigate these risks 
deferred compensation plan we have an unfunded deferred compensation plan for senior managers and executive officers with a total liability balance of million at december  this liability is subject to fluctuation based upon the market value of the investment options selected by participants
