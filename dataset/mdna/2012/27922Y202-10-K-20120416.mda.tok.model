this award is for a year term to conduct work as the sole vehicle tester for the doe s advanced vehicle testing activity 
we recognized revenue of million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  we experienced net losses of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  the following table sets forth our results of operations for the years ended december  and in thousands  except percentages twelve months ended december  dollar increase percentage increase decrease decrease revenue    cost of revenue    gross profit operating expenses general and administrative    depreciation and amortization research and development warrant expense   total operating expenses    loss from operations    other income expense interest income interest expense  gain loss on disposal of assets other income total other income expense net loss before tax    provision for income tax net loss    revenue and cost of revenue we recognized revenue of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in revenue of million or in is primarily related to the revenue earned on the work performed under the doe contract  which was million in compared to million in as anticipated  the majority of our revenue in was derived from the doe contract based on deliveries of chargers and related data collection 
our estimate of revenue for the doe contract was revised in our fourth quarter reporting based on verbal notification from the doe in january that the process of definitization had commenced  and that certain in kind costs previously agreed in our budget and accepted as valid cost share through december  would no longer be recognized as allowable cost share under the contract 
in anticipation of a written amendment denoting this change  we have excluded the in kind costs no longer allowed for reimbursement from the measure of cumulative effort incurred under the ev project for purposes of recognizing grant revenue 
this change in estimate resulted in a reduction in our revenues for the quarter ended december  of million 
the in kind costs submitted as cost share in  that are no longer recognized as allowable following definitization will be replaced in the course of the remaining contract term with other allowable in kind cost share and we will recognize the related deferred revenue as those in kind costs are incurred 
notwithstanding this change  we expect our aggregate reimbursements by the doe under the contract to remain at million  and our aggregate costs to be incurred to remain at approximately million in cash based costs  and approximately million in in kind costs 
as such  we believe the definitization will not change significantly the terms of the doe grant 
cost of revenue primarily consists of labor  materials  facilities and equipment related to the manufacturing of chargers and development of the blink network 
cost of revenue was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million  or  was primarily due to the planned growth of the ev project revenues in related to the ramp up of contract activities in the form of charger deliveries and data collection 
gross margin percentage for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in the gross margin is reflective of our increased revenues related to the doe contract 
operating expenses total operating expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the largest component of our operating expenses is general and administrative expenses  which were million or of total operating expenses for the year ended december  compared with million or for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses primarily consist of payroll  facilities  legal fees  professional fees and marketing and advertising costs 
general and administrative expenses increased by million or for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
professional fees were million for the year ending december   up million from prior year 
the increase in professional fees is attributable to the use of consultants in to assist with projects to maintain our enterprise resource planning erp system and with finance projects to improve system functionality and to enhance our ability to provide timely and relevant financial data to the organization 
marketing costs were million for the year ending december   up million from prior year related to the promotion of the blink brand 
compensation expense was million for the year ending december   flat with prior year 
reductions in executive compensation of million and in director compensation of million were offset by an increase in all other compensation of million 
the increase in all other compensation is attributable to staffing required to service the ev project 
accounting fees were million for the year ending december   up million from prior year 
the increase in accounting fees is related to higher overall audit fees from prior year of million  and increased tax and other filing review fees of million 
legal fees were million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  the decrease in legal fees is attributable primarily to the reimbursement from our insurance carrier for fees related to the sec fact finding inquiry 
all other general and administrative expenses totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in all other general and administrative expenses was primarily driven by increased resources to support the effective execution of our business plan and the fulfillment of our doe contract obligations 
research and development expenses primarily consist of engineering costs that totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million was due to our focus on research and development activities related to our blink technologies 
we expect our research and development expenses to remain at this level as we continue to expand our research and development activities but expect to fund these costs in whole or in part by partnering with government and industry through research and development cost share contracts 
we incurred warrant expense of million for the year ending december  associated with the issuance of warrants to shenzhen goh in accordance with an amendment to our master overhead joint venture agreement 
warrant expense for the year ending december  was depreciation expense was approximately million for the years ended december  and we expect this expense to increase as we purchase more property and equipment in support of the growth of our operations 
non operating income and expense for the year ended december   we earned interest income in the amount of million compared with million for the year ended december  the decrease in interest income is due to the decrease in our cash and cash equivalents balance in as funds were used for operating activities 
interest expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the higher amount for is attributable to interest accrued on our equipment lease with cisco capital 
for the year ended december  we had a gain on disposal of assets of million compared to a loss on disposal of assets for the same period in of million 
the loss in was primarily related to the disposal of a hydrogen bus no longer operational for use in the business 
other income was for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the amount is attributable to the release of accruals set up in for estimated penalties related to our prior registration statement filings 
segment information generally accepted accounting principles require disclosures related to components of a company for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by a company s chief operating decision maker in deciding the allocation of resources and assessing performance 
ecotality inc is the parent company of fuel cell store and ecotality north america 
innergy  a division of ecotality  is a leader in the design and manufacture of thin sealed rechargeable lead batteries and high quality flat panel multi crystalline solar modules 
fuel cell store is the leading online marketplace for fuel cell related products and technologies with online distribution sites in the us  japan  russia  italy and portugal

ecotality north america also holds exclusive patent rights to the supercharge and minit charger systems battery fast charge systems that allow for faster charging with less heat generation and longer battery life than conventional chargers 
ecotality australia pty ltd  the company s wholly owned subsidiary in australia  markets and distributes our blink and minit charger equipment in australia and southeast asia 
the company includes australia pty ltd 
in its international segment and as other international subsidiaries are established  they would be included in international segment as well 
these subsidiaries are presented four reportable segments fuel cell store  ecotality north america  innergy and international 
management continues to assess how it evaluates segment performance  and currently utilizes income loss from operations 
for the year ended december  and inter segment sales were million and million respectively 
all inter segment sales have been eliminated during the consolidation process 
summarized financial information concerning the company s reportable segments for the year ended december  is as follows year ended december  in thousands ecotality north america innergy fuel cell store international total total revenues    depreciation and amortization  operating income loss  interest expense gain on disposal of assets other expense segment income loss before corporate overhead allocation  corporate overhead allocation  segment loss   not included in segment loss depreciation on corporate assets reported net loss  capital expenditures   total segment assets excluding intercompany receivables  other items not included in segment assets goodwill   other corporate assets  total reported assets  summarized financial information concerning our reportable segments for the year ended december  is as follows year ended december  in thousands ecotality north america innergy fuel cell store international total total revenues    depreciation and amortization operating income loss  interest expense loss on disposal of assets other expense segment income loss before corporate overhead allocation  corporate overhead allocation  segment loss   not included in segment loss depreciation on corporate assets reported net loss  capital expenditures   total segment assets excluding intercompany receivables  other items not included in segment assets goodwill   other corporate assets  total reported assets  ecotality north america is the segment that includes the operating results related to our doe contract 
the changes in operating results by segment are consistent with the fluctuations noted in the results of operations year over year  as the majority of the increase activity is related to activities under the doe contract 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents compared to million as of december  the increase of million is attributable to the completion of our public offering in june that raised million in net cash proceeds  net of underwriting discounts and other offering expenses  and net proceeds of million from the exercise of the underwriter s over allotment option by the underwriters in july as of december  we had million of restricted cash which serves as the collateral for letters of credit and accordingly  is not available for our use in current operations 
our primary uses of cash from operating activities have been for personnel related expenditures and costs related to the doe contract 
we have experienced negative cash flows from operations as we continue to expand our business 
our cash flows from operating activities will continue to be affected principally by our working capital requirements and the extent to which we increase spending on the design and development of our products and the related contracts we enter into during a period 
we utilized cash for operating activities in the amount of million during the year ended december  compared to million during the year ended december  the use of cash reflected a net loss of million in and million in net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the purchase of property and equipment of million in and million in was primarily for items to be utilized in support of the doe contract 
in addition  in and we capitalized approximately million in intangible assets for trademarks and patents costs 
net cash generated by financing activities was million in compared to million in the cash generated in is related to million of capital investment received in january  and to the successful completion of our public offering in june that raised million in net cash proceeds  net of underwriting discounts and other offering expenses  and gross proceeds of million from the exercise of the underwriter s over allotment option by the underwriters in july the amount is attributable to the receipt of million in investment capital received in january these financing activities have been a critical factor in enabling us to transform ourselves to become a leader in the renewable energy sector 
management s plan of operation and for working capital the majority of our operational focus in was focused on the blink network by installing thousands of evse at our customers and partners residential and commercial locations in conjunction with the launch of the nissan leaf and the chevy volt 
the vast majority of the installations in were geared toward satisfying the demand of the ev project 
we also worked to ramp up a sales and field operations organization that will sell  install and service evse and an evse network after the ev project s completion 
we expect the majority of installations in and beyond to come from these direct sales and partnership efforts 
in order for the direct sales efforts to be successful  we must successfully partner with some or all of the following potential partners major retail outlets  large corporate clients  small and medium enterprises  industrial supply companies  utilities  commercial  retail and office building owners  state and local governments and automobile manufacturers 
in addition  we will continue to revamp our industrial line of products and services as we maintain a focus on the slowly recovering warehouse and airport ground support equipment gse markets 
it will be critical for us to develop and launch our next generation of industrial products in with additional features and services  but at lower costs than our products selling price today in order to remain competitive 
net working capital is an important measure of our ability to finance our operations 
our net working capital was million at december  we anticipate a working capital requirement of approximately million for in order to complete the activities associated with the doe contract 
our future capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned and will depend on many factors  including  among other things  market acceptance of our products  the cost of activities associated with the doe contract  and overall economic conditions 
we planned and successfully secured debt financing and entered into a licensing agreement in the first quarter of to address this requirement as noted below 
on march   the company and abbtv entered into a convertible note purchase agreement the convertible note purchase agreement  pursuant to which the company agreed to issue  and the investor agreed to purchase   in aggregate principal amount of a unsecured convertible note due the note 
the company issued  and completed the sale to the investor of  the note 
the note matures on march  and bears interest at a rate of per annum  payable quarterly in arrears in cash on the final day of each fiscal quarter beginning on march  the note is the unsecured obligation of the company and is senior to the company s preferred stock and common stock and other unsecured debt 
the note is convertible into shares of the company s common stock at any time  in whole or in part  at the option of the holder at a per share conversion price equal to  subject to adjustment for stock splits  stock dividends  combinations and other corporate transactions 
on march   the company and abb entered into a blink license agreement the blink license agreement 
subject to certain restrictions  the blink license agreement grants abb and its affiliates a non exclusive  non transferable right and license to use the blink application platform interface in the abb electric vehicle charging system products that abb or its affiliates market and sell in the north american market in perpetuity  the right to use certain of the company s trademarks in connection with the marketing and sale in the north american market of abb products that feature the blink application platform interface  and the right to grant sublicenses with respect to the rights granted under the blink license agreement 
as consideration for the license  the company received  from abb 
contractual obligations on june   the company entered into a license agreement the license agreement with the california institute of technology caltech whereby the company obtained certain exclusive and non exclusive intellectual property licenses pertaining to the development of an electronic fuel cell technology  in exchange for  shares of common stock of the company with a fair market value of million 
in addition  the license agreement contemplated certain additional fee arrangements  to date  no additional fees have been paid in connection with the license agreement 
on january  we purchased a  square foot  stand alone office building at a cost of  a total of  has been paid 
the remaining balance of  net a tax credit of  is structured as an interest only loan from a non affiliated third party  bears an interest rate of calculated annually  with monthly payments in the amount of  due beginning on february  the entire principal balance is due on or before january  this debt was refinanced in the first quarter of as of december   the company has twenty two leases in effect for operating space 
future obligations under these commitments are as follows for the years ending december  for   for   for   for off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets  stock based compensation  inventory valuations  allowance for bad debts  warranty liability  valuation of deferred tax assets  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our future financial statement presentation  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows will be affected 
we believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance  as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates 
revenue recognition we derive our revenue from sales of services and products and government grants related to clean energy technologies 
we recognize revenue when a formal arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  all obligations have been performed pursuant to the terms of the formal arrangement  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we have entered into agreements  including grant agreements  with various government entities  under which we are obligated to deliver services such as development of the infrastructure for deployment of evs  including gathering and completing the related data analyses 
under these agreements  the government entity makes payments to us based on expenditures incurred in the delivery of the services 
we recognize revenue as the related services are performed  based upon the actual efforts incurred relative to the amount of total effort expected to be incurred by us in the performance under each agreement 
amounts related to capital expenditures are recognized over the term of the agreement as the related capital assets are used in the delivery of our services 
revenue is recognized provided that the conditions under which the government payments were made have been met  and we have only perfunctory obligations outstanding 
in certain agreements  the government retains a financial interest in capital assets with a fair value of  or greater at the end of the agreement  which the company may either buy out upon termination of the agreement  offer to the government to buy out the company s interest in the assets or sell the assets in the market and remit to the government the portion of the selling price equal to its financial interest 
in these agreements  the government s estimated financial interest is included in deferred revenues  and the assets are depreciated to the estimated disposal value at the termination of the agreement 
revenue from service agreements with other customers  such as consulting services  is recognized as the services are performed 
all costs of services are expensed as incurred 
revenue from sales of products is recognized when products are delivered and the title and risk of loss pass to the customer 
if the arrangement requires customer acceptance  revenue is recognized when acceptance occurs 
our products are sold without a right of return 
intangible assets intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet consist of capitalized costs to develop trademarks  including attorney fees  registration fees  design costs and the costs of securing the trademark  and legal costs to establish new patents 
we capitalized legal costs to establish new patents or trademarks and amortize the cost over the life of the intangible or its economic use  if deemed to be shorter 
we periodically review our finite lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset is impaired or the estimated useful lives are no longer appropriate 
if indicators of impairment exist and the undiscounted projected cash flows associated with such assets are less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recorded to write the asset down to their estimated fair values 
fair value is estimated based on discounted future cash flows 
goodwill goodwill has been recorded as a result of our acquisition of electric transportation engineering corporation in the goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes 
goodwill is not amortized but instead is subject to an annual impairment test  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it may be impaired 
we evaluate goodwill on an annual basis on october of each fiscal year 
the test for goodwill impairment is a two step process 
the first step compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its respective carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired and  therefore  the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
the second step  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of each reporting unit s goodwill with the respective carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
there were no impairment charges for the year ended december  stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation arrangements with employees using a fair value method  which requires the recognition of compensation expense for costs related to all stock based payments including stock options 
the fair value method requires us to estimate the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
we use the black scholes pricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted that are expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
we account for stock options issued to nonemployees based on the estimated fair value of the awards using the black scholes pricing model 
the measurement of stock based compensation is subject to adjustments as the underlying equity instruments vest  and the resulting change in value  if any  is recognized in our consolidated statements of operations during the period the related services are rendered 
the black scholes model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions which determine the fair value of share based awards 
these assumptions include the expected term  risk free interest rate  expected volatility  and expected dividend 
our expected term represents the estimated time from the date of the grant until the date of exercise and is based on the simplified method which calculates the expected term as the average of the time to vesting and the contractual life of the award 
our expected volatility is determined based on daily historical price observations for our shares over the expected term or as close to that term as possible subject only to the limitation of our trading history 
our risk free interest rate is the market yield currently available on us treasury securities with maturities approximately equal to the option s expected term 
our expected dividend yield was assumed to be zero as we have not paid  and do not anticipate paying  cash dividends on our shares of common stock 
we estimate our forfeiture rate based on an analysis of employee turnover and historical forfeitures  and will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience  analysis of employee turnover and other factors 
quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported stock based compensation expense  as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed 
if a revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate  an adjustment is made that will result in a decrease to the stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
if a revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate  an adjustment is made that will result in an increase to the stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
we will continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected term  volatility and forfeiture rate related to our own stock based compensation on a prospective basis and incorporating these factors into the black scholes option pricing model 
each of these inputs is subjective and generally requires significant management and director judgment to determine 
if  in the future  we determine that another method for calculating the fair value of our stock options is more reasonable  or if another method for calculating these input assumptions is prescribed by authoritative guidance  and  therefore  should be used to estimate expected volatility or expected term  the fair value calculated for our employee stock options could change significantly 
inventory valuation inventory is stated at the lower of cost  determined on a first in  first out basis  or market value 
we record inventory write downs for potentially excess and obsolete inventory based on forecasted demand  economic trends and technological obsolescence of our products 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  future inventory write downs could be required and would be reflected in costs of goods sold in the period the revision is made 
at the point of the loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
if actual demand and market conditions are less favorable than anticipated  additional inventory adjustments could be required in future periods 
accounts receivable accounts receivable are carried on a gross basis  with no discounting  less the allowance for bad debts 
management estimates the allowance for bad debts based on existing economic conditions  the financial conditions of the customers  and the amount and the age of past due accounts 
receivables are considered past due if full payment is not received by the contractual due date 
past due accounts are generally written off against the allowance for bad debts only after all collection attempts have been exhausted 
there is no collateral held by the company for accounts receivable 
warranty the company warrants a limited number of ecotality north america products against defects for periods up to years 
the company accrues for estimated warranty costs at the time of revenue recognition and records such accrued liabilities as part of cost of goods sold 
the estimate of warranty costs is based on historical product data and anticipated future costs 
should actual failure rates differ significantly from our estimates  the impact of these unforeseen costs or cost reductions would be recorded in subsequent periods 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based upon the difference between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted marginal tax rate applicable when the related asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled 
deferred income tax expenses or benefits are based on the changes in the asset or liability each period 
if available evidence suggests that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  a valuation allowance is required to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
future changes in such valuation allowance are included in the provision for deferred income taxes in the period of change 
deferred income taxes may arise from temporary differences resulting from income and expense items reported for financial accounting and tax purposes in different periods 
deferred taxes are classified as current or non current  depending on the classification of assets and liabilities to which they relate 
deferred taxes arising from temporary differences that are not related to an asset or liability are classified as current or non current depending on the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse 
due to certain significant changes in ownership in prior years  some of the net operating losses are subject to limitation under internal revenue code sections segment reporting generally accepted accounting principles require disclosures related to components of a company for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by a company s chief operating decision maker in deciding the allocation of resources and assessing performance
