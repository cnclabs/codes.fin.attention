competition the banking industry and related financial service providers operate in a highly competitive market 
old national competes with financial service providers such as local  regional and national banking institutions  savings and loan associations  credit unions  finance companies  investment brokers  and mortgage banking companies 
in addition  old national s non bank services face competition with asset managers and advisory services  money market and mutual fund companies and insurance agencies 
supervision and regulation old national is subject to extensive regulation under federal and state laws 
the regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of depositors  federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole and not for the protection of shareholders and creditors 
significant elements of the laws and regulations applicable to old national and its subsidiaries are described below 
the description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes  regulations and policies that are described 
also  such statutes  regulations and policies are continually under review by congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies 
a change in statutes  regulations or regulatory policies applicable to old national and its subsidiaries could have a material effect on the business of the company 
the dodd frank act on july   financial regulatory reform legislation entitled the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act was signed into law 
the dodd frank act implements far reaching changes across the financial regulatory landscape  including provisions that  among other things  will centralize responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating a new agency  the consumer financial protection bureau  responsible for implementing  examining and enforcing compliance with federal consumer financial laws 
restrict the preemption of state law by federal law and disallow subsidiaries and affiliates of national banks  such as old national bank  from availing themselves of such preemption 
apply the same leverage and risk based capital requirements that apply to insured depository institutions to most bank holding companies  which  among other things  will require old national to deduct  over three years beginning january   all trust preferred securities from old national s tier capital 
require the office of the comptroller of the currency to seek to make its capital requirements for national banks  such as old national bank  countercyclical so that capital requirements increase in times of economic expansion and decrease in times of economic contraction

change the assessment base for federal deposit insurance from the amount of insured deposits to consolidated assets less tangible capital  eliminate the ceiling on the size of the deposit insurance fund dif and increase the floor of the size of the dif 
impose comprehensive regulation of the over the counter derivatives market  which would include certain provisions that would effectively prohibit insured depository institutions from conducting certain derivatives businesses in the institution itself 
require large  publicly traded bank holding companies to create a risk committee responsible for the oversight of enterprise risk management 
implement corporate governance revisions  including with regard to executive compensation and proxy access by shareholders  that apply to all public companies  not just financial institutions

amend the electronic fund transfer act efta to  among other things  give the federal reserve the authority to establish rules regarding interchange fees charged for electronic debit transactions by payment card issuers having assets over billion and to enforce a new statutory requirement that such fees be reasonable and proportional to the actual cost of a transaction to the issuer 
many aspects of the dodd frank act are subject to rulemaking and will take effect over several years  making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on old national  its customers or the financial industry more generally 
provisions in the legislation that affect the payment of interest on demand deposits and interchange fees are likely to increase the costs associated with deposits as well as place limitations on certain revenues those deposits may generate 
provisions in the legislation that revoke the tier capital treatment of trust preferred securities and otherwise require revisions to the capital requirements of old national and old national bank could require old national and old national bank to seek other sources of capital in the future

the bhc act requires the prior approval of the federal reserve to acquire more than a voting interest of any bank or bank holding company 
additionally  the bhc act restricts old national s non banking activities to those which are determined by the federal reserve to be closely related to banking and a proper incident thereto

bank holding companies are required to comply with the federal reserve s risk based capital guidelines 
the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and the office of the comptroller of the currency occ have adopted risk based capital ratio guidelines to which depository institutions under their respective supervision are subject 
the guidelines establish a systematic analytical framework that makes regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banking organizations 
risk based capital ratios are determined by allocating assets and specified off balance sheet commitments to four risk weighted categories  with higher levels of capital being required for the categories perceived as representing greater risk 
old national s banking affiliate  old national bank  met all risk based capital requirements of the fdic and occ as of december  for old national s regulatory capital ratios and regulatory requirements as of december   see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in december and january  the basel committee on banking supervision published the final texts of reforms on capital and liquidity generally referred to as basel iii 
although basel iii is intended to be implemented by participating countries for large  internationally active banks  its provisions are likely to be considered by united states banking regulators in developing new regulations applicable to other banks in the united states  including old national bank 
for banks in the united states  among the most significant provisions of basel iii concerning capital are the following a minimum ratio of common equity to risk weighted assets reaching  plus an additional as a capital conservation buffer  by after a phase in period 
a minimum ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets reaching by after a phase in period 
a minimum ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets  plus the additional capital conservation buffer  reaching by after a phase in period 
an additional countercyclical capital buffer to be imposed by applicable national banking regulators periodically at their discretion  with advance notice

the issuer must maintain authorization to issue the requisite shares of common equity if conversion were required 

table of contents the basel iii provisions on liquidity include complex criteria establishing a liquidity coverage ratio lcr and a net stable funding ratio nsfr 
the purpose of the lcr is to ensure that a bank maintains adequate unencumbered  high quality liquid assets to meet its liquidity needs for days under a severe liquidity stress scenario 
the purpose of the nsfr is to promote more medium and long term funding of assets and activities  using a one year horizon 
although basel iii is described as a final text  it is subject to the resolution of certain issues and to further guidance and modification  as well as to adoption by united states banking regulators  including decisions as to whether and to what extent it will apply to united states banks that are not large  internationally active banks  such as old national 
in june  the federal banking agencies adopted a rule applicable to only large  internationally active banks requiring their risk based capital to meet the higher of the minimum requirements under the advanced approaches or under the risk based capital rules generally applicable to united states banks 
old national bank is subject to the provisions of the national bank act  is supervised  regulated and examined by the occ  and is subject to the rules and regulations of the occ  federal reserve and the fdic 
a substantial portion of old national s cash revenue is derived from dividends paid to it by old national bank 
these dividends are subject to various legal and regulatory restrictions as summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
both federal and state law extensively regulate various aspects of the banking business  such as reserve requirements  truth in lending and truth in savings disclosures  equal credit opportunity  fair credit reporting  trading in securities and other aspects of banking operations 
branching by old national bank is subject to the jurisdiction and requires notice to or the prior approval of the occ 
old national and old national bank are subject to the federal reserve act  which restricts financial transactions between banks and affiliated companies 
the statute limits credit transactions between banks  affiliated companies and its executive officers and its affiliates 
the statute prescribes terms and conditions for bank affiliate transactions deemed to be consistent with safe and sound banking practices  and restricts the types of collateral security permitted in connection with a bank s extension of credit to an affiliate 
additionally  all transactions with an affiliate must be on terms substantially the same or at least as favorable to the institution as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated parties 
fdicia accomplished a number of sweeping changes in the regulation of depository institutions  including old national bank 
fdicia requires  among other things  federal bank regulatory authorities to take prompt corrective action with respect to banks which do not meet minimum capital requirements 
fdicia further directs that each federal banking agency prescribe standards for depository institutions and depository institution holding companies relating to internal controls  information systems  internal audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate exposure  asset growth  management compensation  a maximum ratio of classified assets to capital  minimum earnings sufficient to absorb losses  a minimum ratio of market value to book value of publicly traded shares and such other standards as the agency deems appropriate 
the riegle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of allows for interstate banking and interstate branching without regard to whether such activity is permissible under state law 
bank holding companies may now acquire banks anywhere in the united states subject to certain state restrictions 
the gramm leach bliley act glba permits bank holding companies which have elected to become financial holding companies to engage in a substantially broader range of non banking activities  including securities  investment advice and insurance activities  than is permissible for bank holding companies that have not elected to become financial holding companies 
old national has elected to be a financial holding company 
as a result  old national may underwrite and sell securities and insurance 
it may acquire  or be acquired by  brokerage firms and insurance underwriters 
glba established new requirements for financial institutions to provide enhanced privacy protections to customers 
in june of  the federal banking agencies jointly adopted a final regulation providing for the implementation of these protections 
financial institutions are required to provide notice to consumers which details its privacy policies and practices  describes under what conditions a financial institution may disclose nonpublic personal information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties and provides an opt out method which enables consumers to prevent the financial institution from disclosing customer information to nonaffiliated third parties 
financial institutions were required to be in compliance with the final regulation by july   and old national was in compliance at such date and continues to be in compliance 

table of contents in october  the emergency economic stabilization act of eesa was enacted 
the eesa authorized the treasury department to purchase from financial institutions and their holding companies up to billion in mortgage loans  mortgage related securities and certain other financial instruments  including debt and equity securities issued by financial institutions and their holding companies in a troubled asset relief program tarp

the tagp was extended through december  the enactment of the dodd frank act provides unlimited federal deposit insurance until december  for noninterest bearing demand transaction accounts at all insured depository institutions 
on february   the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra was signed into law by president obama 
arra includes a wide variety of programs intended to stimulate the economy and provide for extensive infrastructure  energy  health  and education needs 
in addition  arra imposes certain new executive compensation and corporate expenditure limits on all current and future tarp recipients  including old national  until the institution has repaid the treasury  which is now permitted under arra without penalty and without the need to raise new capital  subject to the treasury s consultation with the recipient s appropriate regulatory agency 
old national has been a tarp recipient  but has exercised its right to repay treasury and is no longer subject to the compensation and corporate expenditure limits imposed by arra on tarp recipients 
for details regarding old national s participation in tarp  refer to the financial condition capital section of item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in addition to the matters discussed above  old national bank is subject to additional regulation of its activities  including a variety of consumer protection regulations affecting its lending  deposit and collection activities and regulations affecting secondary mortgage market activities 
the earnings of financial institutions are also affected by general economic conditions and prevailing interest rates  both domestic and foreign and by the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states government and its various agencies  particularly the federal reserve 
additional legislative and administrative actions affecting the banking industry may be considered by congress  state legislatures and various regulatory agencies  including those referred to above 
it cannot be predicted with certainty whether such legislative or administrative action will be enacted or the extent to which the banking industry in general or old national and old national bank in particular would be affected

risk factors old national s business could be harmed by any of the risks noted below 
in analyzing whether to make or to continue an investment in old national  investors should consider  among other factors  the following risks related to old national s business economic conditions have affected and could continue to adversely affect our revenues and profits 
from december through june  the us economy was in recession 
business activity across a wide range of industries and regions in the us was greatly reduced 
although economic conditions have begun to slowly improve  certain sectors  such as real estate  remain weak and unemployment remains high 
local governments and many businesses are still in serious difficulty due to lower consumer spending and the lack of liquidity in the credit markets 
market conditions also led to the failure or merger of several prominent financial institutions and numerous regional and community based financial institutions 
these failures  as well as projected future failures  have had a significant negative impact on the capitalization level of the deposit insurance fund of the fdic  which  in turn  has led to a significant increase in deposit insurance premiums paid by financial institutions 
old national s financial performance generally  and in particular the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans  as well as demand for loans and other products and services that old national offers  is highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets where old national operates and in the united states as a whole 
a favorable business environment is generally characterized by  among other factors  economic growth  efficient capital markets  low inflation  low unemployment  high business and investor confidence  and strong business earnings 
unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth  business activity or investor or business confidence  limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital  increases in inflation or interest rates  high unemployment  natural disasters  terrorist acts or a combination of these or other factors 
the business environment has been adverse for many households and businesses in the united states and worldwide 
while economic conditions in the united states and worldwide have begun to improve  there can be no assurance that this improvement will continue 
such conditions could adversely affect the credit quality of old national s loans  results of operations and financial condition 
in response to economic and market conditions  from time to time we have undertaken initiatives to reduce our cost structure where appropriate 
these initiatives  as well as any future workforce and facilities reductions  may not be sufficient to meet current and future changes in economic and market conditions and allow us to achieve profitability 
in addition  costs actually incurred in connection with our restructuring actions may be higher than our estimates of such costs and or may not lead to the anticipated cost savings 
unless and until the economy  loan demand  credit quality and consumer confidence improve  it is unlikely that revenues will increase significantly  and may be reduced further 
if old national s actual loan losses exceed old national s allowance for loan losses  old national s net income will decrease 
old national makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectibility of old national s loan portfolio  including the creditworthiness of old national s borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of old national s loans 
despite old national s underwriting and monitoring practices  
table of contents the effect of the declining economy could negatively impact the ability of old national s borrowers to repay loans in a timely manner and could also negatively impact collateral values 
as a result  old national may experience significant loan losses that could have a material adverse effect on old national s operating results 
since old national must use assumptions regarding individual loans and the economy  old national s current allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses 
old national s assumptions may not anticipate the severity or duration of the current credit cycle and old national may need to significantly increase old national s provision for losses on loans if one or more of old national s larger loans or credit relationships becomes delinquent or if old national expands its commercial real estate and commercial lending 
in addition  federal and state regulators periodically review old national s allowance for loan losses and may require old national to increase the provision for loan losses or recognize loan charge offs 
material additions to old national s allowance would materially decrease old national s net income 
there can be no assurance that old national s monitoring procedures and policies will reduce certain lending risks or that old national s allowance for loan losses will be adequate to cover actual losses 
old national s loan portfolio includes loans with a higher risk of loss 
old national bank originates commercial real estate loans  commercial loans  agricultural real estate loans  agricultural loans  consumer loans  and residential real estate loans primarily within old national s market areas 
commercial real estate  commercial  consumer  and agricultural loans may expose a lender to greater credit risk than loans secured by residential real estate because the collateral securing these loans may not be sold as easily as residential real estate 
these loans also have greater credit risk than residential real estate for the following reasons commercial real estate loans 
repayment is dependent upon income being generated in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service 
commercial loans 
repayment is dependent upon the successful operation of the borrower s business 
consumer loans 
consumer loans such as personal lines of credit are collateralized  if at all  with assets that may not provide an adequate source of payment of the loan due to depreciation  damage  or loss 
agricultural loans 
repayment is dependent upon the successful operation of the business  which is greatly dependent on many things outside the control of either old national bank or the borrowers 
these factors include weather  commodity prices  and interest rates 
we face risks with respect to expansion 
we have acquired  and may continue to acquire  other financial institutions or parts of those institutions in the future  and we may engage in de novo branch expansion 
we may also consider and enter into new lines of business or offer new products or services 
we may incur substantial costs to expand  and we can give no assurance such expansion will result in the levels of profits we seek 
there can be no assurance integration efforts for any mergers or acquisitions will be successful 
also  we may issue equity securities in connection with acquisitions  which could cause ownership and economic dilution to our current shareholders 
there is no assurance that  following any mergers or acquisitions  our integration efforts will be successful or that  after giving effect to the acquisition  we will achieve profits comparable to or better than our historical experience 

table of contents acquisitions and mergers involve a number of expenses and risks  including the time and costs associated with identifying potential new markets  as well as acquisition and merger targets  the estimates and judgments used to evaluate credit  operations  management and market risks with respect to the target institution may not be accurate  the time and costs of evaluating new markets  hiring experienced local management and opening new offices  and the time lags between these activities and the generation of sufficient assets and deposits to support the costs of the expansion  our ability to finance an acquisition and possible dilution to our existing shareholders  the diversion of our management s attention to the negotiation of a transaction  and the integration of the operations and personnel of the combined businesses  entry into new markets where we lack experience  the introduction of new products and services into our business  the incurrence and possible impairment of goodwill associated with an acquisition and possible adverse short term effects on our results of operations  and the risk of loss of key employees and customers 
in the current economic environment  we anticipate that in addition to opportunities to acquire other banks in privately negotiated transactions  we may also have opportunities to bid to acquire the assets and liabilities of failed banks in fdic assisted transactions 
these acquisitions involve risks similar to acquiring existing banks 
because fdic assisted acquisitions are structured in a manner that would not allow us the time normally associated with due diligence investigations prior to committing to purchase the target bank or preparing for integrations of an acquired bank  we may face additional risks in fdic assisted transactions 
these risks include  among other things loss of customers of the failed bank  strain on management resources related to collection and management of problem loans  problems related to integration of personnel and operating systems  the ultimate collectibility of claims with the fdic under the shared loss agreement are dependent upon the performance of the underlying covered assets  the passage of time and our ability to service loans in accordance with the shared loss agreement  and losses may exceed our estimates and move us into a tranche where we have coverage under our loss sharing agreements with the fdic 
our growth or future losses may require us to raise additional capital in the future  but that capital may not be available when it is needed or the cost of that capital may be very high 
we are required by regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations 
we anticipate that our capital resources will satisfy our capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
we may at some point need to raise additional capital to support continued growth or losses  both internally and through acquisitions 
any capital we obtain may result in the dilution of the interests of existing holders of our common stock 
our ability to raise additional capital  if needed  will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time which are outside our control and on our financial condition and performance 
accordingly  we cannot make assurances of our ability to raise additional capital if needed  or if the terms will be acceptable to us 
if we cannot raise additional capital when needed  our ability to further expand our operations through internal growth and acquisitions could be materially impaired and our financial condition and liquidity could be materially and negatively affected 

table of contents our wholesale funding sources may prove insufficient to replace deposits or support our future growth 
as a part of our liquidity management  we use a number of funding sources in addition to core deposit growth and repayments and maturities of loans and investments 
these sources include brokered certificates of deposit  repurchase agreements  and federal funds purchased 
negative operating results or changes in industry conditions could lead to an inability to replace these additional funding sources at maturity 
our financial flexibility could be constrained if we are unable to maintain our access to funding or if adequate financing is not available to accommodate future growth at acceptable interest rates 
finally  if we are required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources to support future growth  our revenues may not increase proportionately to cover our costs 
in this case  our results of operations and financial condition would be negatively affected 
if old national forecloses on collateral property  old national may be subject to the increased costs associated with the ownership of real property  resulting in reduced revenues 
old national may have to foreclose on collateral property to protect old national s investment and may thereafter own and operate such property  in which case old national will be exposed to the risks inherent in the ownership of real estate 
the amount that old national  as a mortgagee  may realize after a default is dependent upon factors outside of old national s control  including  but not limited to i general or local economic conditions  ii neighborhood values  iii interest rates  iv real estate tax rates  v operating expenses of the mortgaged properties  vi environmental remediation liabilities  vii ability to obtain and maintain adequate occupancy of the properties  viii zoning laws  ix governmental rules  regulations and fiscal policies  and x acts of god 
certain expenditures associated with the ownership of real estate  principally real estate taxes  insurance  and maintenance costs  may adversely affect the income from the real estate 
therefore  the cost of operating real property may exceed the income earned from such property  and old national may have to advance funds in order to protect old national s investment  or old national may be required to dispose of the real property at a loss 
the foregoing expenditures and costs could adversely affect old national s ability to generate revenues  resulting in reduced levels of profitability 
old national operates in an extremely competitive market  and old national s business will suffer if old national is unable to compete effectively 
in old national s market area  the company encounters significant competition from other commercial banks  savings and loan associations  credit unions  mortgage banking firms  consumer finance companies securities brokerage firms  insurance companies  money market mutual funds and other financial intermediaries 
the company s competitors may have substantially greater resources and lending limits than old national does and may offer services that old national does not or cannot provide 
old national s profitability depends upon old national s continued ability to compete successfully in old national s market area 
the loss of key members of old national s senior management team could adversely affect old national s business 
old national believes that old national s success depends largely on the efforts and abilities of old national s senior management 
their experience and industry contacts significantly benefit old national 
the competition for qualified personnel in the financial services industry is intense  and the loss of any of old national s key personnel or an inability to continue to attract  retain and motivate key personnel could adversely affect old national s business 
a breach of information security or compliance breach by one of our agents or vendors could negatively affect old national s reputation and business 
old national relies upon a variety of computing platforms and networks over the internet for the purposes of data processing  communication and information exchange 
despite the safeguards instituted by old national  such systems are susceptible to a breach of security 
in addition  old national relies on the services of a variety of third party vendors to meet old national s data processing and communication needs 
the occurrence of any failures  interruptions or security breaches of old national s information systems or our vendors information systems could damage our reputation  result in a loss of customer business  and expose us to civil litigation and possible financial loss 
such costs and or losses could materially affect old national s earnings 

table of contents fiduciary activity risk factor old national is subject to claims and litigation pertaining to fiduciary responsibility from time to time  customers make claims and take legal action pertaining to old national s performance of its fiduciary responsibilities 
if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to old national they may result in significant financial liability and or adversely affect the market perception of old national and its products and services as well as impact customer demand for those products and services 
any financial liability or reputational damage could have a material adverse effect on the old national s business  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on the old national s financial condition and results of operations 
risks related to the banking industry old national operates in a highly regulated environment  and changes in laws and regulations to which old national is subject may adversely affect old national s results of operations 
old national operates in a highly regulated environment and is subject to extensive regulation  supervision and examination by the office of comptroller of the currency occ  the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic  the board of governors of the federal reserve system the federal reserve and the state of indiana 
such regulation and supervision of the activities in which an institution may engage is primarily intended for the protection of the depositors and federal deposit insurance funds 
in addition  the treasury has certain supervisory and oversight duties and responsibilities under eesa and the cpp 
see business supervision and regulation herein 
applicable laws and regulations may change  and such changes may adversely affect old national s business 
the dodd frank act  enacted in july  instituted major changes to the banking and financial institutions regulatory regimes in light of the recent performance of and government intervention in the financial services sector 
many aspects of the dodd frank act are subject to rulemaking and will take effect over several years  making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on old national 
provisions in the legislation that affect the payment of interest on demand deposits and interchange fees are likely to increase the costs associated with deposits as well as place limitation on certain revenues those deposits may generate 
provisions in the legislation that revoke the tier capital treatment of trust preferred securities and otherwise require revisions to the capital requirements of old national and old national bank could require old national and old national bank to seek other sources of capital in the future 
in addition  certain provisions in the legislation that do not currently apply to old national may become effective if old national grows and its consolidated assets increase to over ten billion 
regulatory authorities also have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities  including but not limited to the imposition of restrictions on the operation of an institution  the classification of assets by the institution  the adequacy of an institution s bank secrecy act anti money laundering program management  and the adequacy of an institution s allowance for loan losses 
any change in such regulation and oversight  whether in the form of restrictions on activities  regulatory policy  regulations  or legislation  including but not limited to changes in the regulations governing institutions  could have a material impact on old national and its operations 
changes in economic or political conditions could adversely affect old national s earnings  as old national s borrowers ability to repay loans and the value of the collateral securing old national s loans decline 
old national s success depends  to a certain extent  upon economic or political conditions  local and national  as well as governmental monetary policies 
conditions such as recession  unemployment  changes in interest rates  inflation  money supply and other factors beyond old national s control may adversely affect its asset quality  deposit levels and loan demand and  therefore  the old national s earnings 
because old national has a significant amount of commercial real estate loans  decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property 
table of contents used as collateral 
adverse changes in the economy may also have a negative effect on the ability of old national s borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans  which would have an adverse impact on old national s earnings 
in addition  substantially all of old national s loans are to individuals and businesses in old national s market area 
consequently  any economic decline in old national s primary market areas which include indiana  kentucky and illinois could have an adverse impact on old national s earnings 
changes in interest rates could adversely affect old national s results of operations and financial condition 
old national s earnings depend substantially on old national s interest rate spread  which is the difference between i the rates old national earns on loans  securities and other earning assets and ii the interest rates old national pays on deposits and other borrowings 
these rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond old national s control  including general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities 
if market interest rates rise  old national will have competitive pressures to increase the rates old national pays on deposits  which could result in a decrease of old national s net interest income 
if market interest rates decline  old national could experience fixed rate loan prepayments and higher investment portfolio cash flows  resulting in a lower yield on earnings assets 
our internal operations are subject to a number of risks 
old national s internal operations are subject to certain risks  including but not limited to  data processing system failures and errors  customer or employee fraud and catastrophic failures resulting from terrorist acts or natural disasters 
operational risk resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes  people  and systems includes the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside of our company  the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees  errors relating to transaction processing and systems  and breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements 
this risk of loss also includes potential legal actions that could arise as a result of the operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards 
the banking industry is undergoing technological innovation at a fast pace 
to keep up with its competition  old national needs to stay abreast of innovations and evaluate those technologies that will enable it to compete on a cost effective basis 
the cost of such technology  including personnel  can be high in both absolute and relative terms 
there can be no assurance  given the fast pace of change and innovation  that old national s technology  either purchased or developed internally  will meet or continue to meet the needs of old national 
our earnings could be adversely impacted by incidences of fraud and compliance failures that are not within our direct control 
financial institutions are inherently exposed to fraud risk 
a fraud can be perpetrated by a customer of the bank  an employee  a vendor  or members of the general public 
we are most subject to fraud and compliance risk in connection with the origination of loans  ach transactions  atm transactions and checking transactions 
our largest fraud risk  associated with the origination of loans  includes the intentional misstatement of information in property appraisals or other underwriting documentation provided to us by third parties 
compliance risk is the risk that loans are not originated in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and our standards 
there can be no assurance that we can prevent or detect acts of fraud or violation of law or our compliance standards by the third parties that we deal with 
repeated incidences of fraud or compliance failures would adversely impact the performance of our loan portfolio 
risks related to old national s stock we may not be able to pay dividends in the future in accordance with past practice 
old national has traditionally paid a quarterly dividend to common stockholders 
the payment of dividends is subject to legal and regulatory restrictions 
any payment of dividends in the future will depend  in large part  on old national s earnings  capital requirements  financial condition and other factors considered relevant by old national s board of directors 

table of contents the price of old national s common stock may be volatile  which may result in losses for investors 
general market price declines or market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of old national s common stock 
in addition  the following factors may cause the market price for shares of old national s common stock to fluctuate announcements of developments related to old national s business  fluctuations in old national s results of operations  sales or purchases of substantial amounts of old national s securities in the marketplace  general conditions in old national s banking niche or the worldwide economy  a shortfall or excess in revenues or earnings compared to securities analysts expectations  changes in analysts recommendations or projections  and old national s announcement of new acquisitions or other projects

certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages 
old national contests liability and or the amount of damages as appropriate in each pending matter 
in view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters  particularly in cases where claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages or where investigations and proceedings are in the early stages  old national cannot predict with certainty the loss or range of loss  if any  related to such matters  how or if such matters will be resolved  when they will ultimately be resolved  or what the eventual settlement  or other relief  if any  might be 
subject to the foregoing  old national believes  based on current knowledge and after consultation with counsel  that the outcome of such pending matters will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of old national  although the outcome of such matters could be material to old national s operating results and cash flows for a particular future period  depending on  among other things  the level of old national s revenues or income for such period

corporate developments in fiscal net income for was million  an increase of million from diluted earnings per share available to common shareholders were per share  an increase of per share from improvement in net income was primarily due to the following our acquisition of monroe bancorp on january  and our fdic assisted acquisition of integra bank at july   and lower provision expense 
other significant actions include controlling expenses remained a company wide focus throughout we still aspire to attain a percent efficiency ratio by the end of during  we continued to reduce long term debt  a more expensive source of funding 
this includes the redemption of our million subordinated debentures on october  subsequent to year end  old national announced the partnership with indiana community bancorp based out of columbus  indiana 
this acquisition will add full service financial centers and increase our presence in south central indiana 
business outlook we believe we are in the midst of a slow  steady economic recovery that is likely to require at least another year for full stabilization to be achieved 
the federal reserve has signaled its intention to keep both long and short term rates low for an indefinite period  but we still anticipate that will pose challenges for revenue growth 

table of contents our goals for are much the same as they were in increase revenue  reduce expenses and target partnership opportunities that align with our financial and strategic goals 
while we remain committed to the same conservative  risk conscious approach to lending  we know how vital it is to generate new loan growth in and beyond 
we believe our new partnerships  and the new client base they represent  position us well to achieve this growth 
just as we did in  we will continue to look for ways to enhance the company s efficiency ratio through process improvements  organizational streamlining and other cost reduction strategies 
we continue to target additional partnerships 
we are focused on community banks in growth markets that are either within or near our existing franchise 
such strategic consolidations should improve the company s bottom line while expanding our distribution network  which helps build long term shareholder value 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain income statement information of old national for the years ended december    and september  september  september  dollars in thousands income statement summary net interest income provision for loan losses noninterest income noninterest expense other data return on average common equity efficiency ratio tier leverage ratio net charge offs to average loans efficiency ratio is defined as noninterest expense before amortization of intangibles as a percent of fully taxable equivalent net interest income and noninterest income  excluding net gains from securities transactions 
this presentation excludes intangible amortization and net securities gains  as is common in other company disclosures  and better aligns with true operating performance 
comparison of fiscal years and net interest income net interest income is the most significant component of our earnings  comprising over of revenues 
net interest income and margin are influenced by many factors  primarily the volume and mix of earning assets  funding sources and interest rate fluctuations 
other factors include prepayment risk on mortgage and investment related assets and the composition and maturity of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
loans typically generate more interest income than investment securities with similar maturities 
funding from client deposits generally cost less than wholesale funding sources 
factors such as general economic activity  federal reserve board monetary policy and price volatility of competing alternative investments  can also exert significant influence on our ability to optimize the mix of assets and funding and the net interest income and margin 
net interest income is the excess of interest received from earning assets over interest paid on interest bearing liabilities 
for analytical purposes  net interest income is also presented in the table that follows  adjusted to a taxable equivalent basis to reflect what our tax exempt assets would need to yield in order to achieve the same after tax yield as a taxable asset 
we used the federal statutory tax rate in effect of for all periods adjusted for the tefra interest disallowance applicable to certain tax exempt obligations 
this analysis portrays the income tax benefits associated in tax exempt assets and helps to facilitate a comparison between taxable and tax exempt assets 

table of contents management believes that it is a standard practice in the banking industry to present net interest margin and net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis 
therefore  management believes these measures provide useful information for both management and investors by allowing them to make peer comparisons 
september  september  september  dollars in thousands net interest income conversion to fully taxable equivalent net interest income taxable equivalent basis average earning assets net interest margin net interest margin taxable equivalent basis net interest income was million in  a increase from the million reported in taxable equivalent net interest income was million in  a increase from the million reported in the net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis was for  a basis point increase compared to the reported in the increase in both net interest income and net interest margin is primarily due to the acquisition of monroe bancorp on january  and integra bank on july  combined with a change in the mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the accretion associated with the purchased assets benefited net interest margin by basis points in we expect this benefit to decline over time 
the yield on average earning assets increased basis points from to while the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points from to 
average earning assets increased by million  or 
average interest bearing liabilities increased million  or 
the increase in average earning assets consisted of a million increase in loans  a million decrease in lower yielding investment securities and a million decrease in money market and other interest earning investments 
the increase in average interest bearing liabilities consisted of a million increase in interest bearing deposits  a million increase in short term borrowings and a million decrease in other borrowings 
noninterest bearing deposits increased by million 
significantly affecting average earning assets during was the increase in the size of the loan portfolio combined with the reduction in the size of the investment portfolio and the decrease in interest earning cash balances at the federal reserve 
included in average earning assets for are approximately million from the monroe bancorp acquisition  which was acquired on january  and million from the integra bank acquisition  which was acquired on july  we adjusted the composition of the investment portfolio to manage the effective duration of the portfolio and reduce the leverage on the balance sheet as proceeds from principal and interest payments and securities sales were used to reduce other borrowings 
the increase in average loans during is a result of the monroe bancorp and integra bank acquisitions 
commercial and commercial real estate loans continue to be affected by weak loan demand in our markets  more stringent loan underwriting standards and our desire to lower future potential credit risk by being cautious towards the real estate market 
the loan portfolio  which generally has an average yield higher than the investment portfolio  has increased as a percent of interest earning assets during and was approximately percent of interest earning assets at december  positively affecting margin was an increase in noninterest bearing demand deposits combined with decreases in time deposits and other borrowings

table of contents provision for income taxes we record a provision for income taxes currently payable and for income taxes payable or benefits to be received in the future  which arise due to timing differences in the recognition of certain items for financial statement and income tax purposes 
the major difference between the effective tax rate applied to our financial statement income and the federal statutory tax rate is caused by interest on tax exempt securities and loans 
the effective tax rate varied significantly from to due to increases in pre tax income while tax exempt income has decreased

table of contents allowance for loan losses to provide for the risk of loss inherent in extending credit  we maintain an allowance for loan losses 
the determination of the allowance is based upon the size and current risk characteristics of the loan portfolio and includes an assessment of individual problem loans  actual loss experience  current economic events and regulatory guidance

the reserve for residential real estate loans as a percentage of that portfolio remained constant at at both december  and december  the reserve for consumer loans decreased to at december   from at december  the lower reserve percentages for these portfolios are a result of improved credit quality in these portfolios during allowance for losses on unfunded commitments we maintain an allowance for losses on unfunded commercial lending commitments and letters of credit to provide for the risk of loss inherent in these arrangements 
the allowance is computed using a methodology similar to that used to determine the allowance for loan losses  modified to take into account the probability of a drawdown on the commitment 
this allowance is reported as a liability on the balance sheet within accrued expenses and other liabilities  while the corresponding provision for these loan losses is recorded as a component of other expense

table of contents risk management overview management  with the oversight of the board of directors through its risk and credit policy committee and its funds management committee  has in place company wide structures  processes  and controls for managing and mitigating risk 
the following discussion addresses the three major risks we face credit  market  and liquidity 
credit risk credit risk represents the risk of loss arising from an obligor s inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms 
our primary credit risks result from our investment and lending activities 
investment activities within our securities portfolio  the non agency collateralized mortgage obligations represent the greatest exposure to the current instability in the residential real estate and credit markets 
at december   we had non agency collateralized mortgage obligations with a market value of million  or approximately of the available for sale securities portfolio 
the unrealized loss on these securities at december   was approximately million 
we expect conditions in the overall residential real estate market to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future 
deterioration in the performance of the underlying loan collateral could result in deterioration in the performance of our asset backed securities 
nine non agency mortgage backed securities were rated below investment grade as of december  during we experienced million of other than temporary impairment losses on three of these securities  of which million was recorded as a credit loss in earnings and million is included in other comprehensive income 
during the fourth quarter of we sold two non agency mortgage backed securities with an amortized cost basis of approximately million that were below investment grade 
during we experienced million of other than temporary impairment losses on ten of these securities  of which million was recorded as a credit loss in earnings and million is included in other comprehensive income 
we also carry a higher exposure to loss in our pooled trust preferred securities  which are collateralized debt obligations  due to illiquidity in that market and the performance of the underlying collateral 
at december   we had pooled trust preferred securities with a fair value of approximately million  or of the available for sale securities portfolio 
during  we experienced million of other than temporary impairment on one of these securities  all of which was recorded as a credit loss in earnings 
these securities remained classified as available for sale and at december   the unrealized loss on our pooled trust preferred securities was approximately million 
during  three of these securities experienced million of other than temporary impairment  all of which was recorded as a credit loss in earnings 
the remaining mortgage backed securities are backed by us government sponsored or federal agencies 
municipal bonds  corporate bonds and other debt securities are evaluated by reviewing the credit worthiness of the issuer and general market conditions 
we do not have the intent to sell these securities and it is likely that we will not be required to sell these securities before their anticipated recovery 
included in the held to maturity category at december  are approximately million of agency mortgage backed securities and million of municipal securities at amortized cost 
counterparty exposure counterparty exposure is the risk that the other party in a financial transaction will not fulfill its obligation in a financial transaction 
we define counterparty exposure as nonperformance risk in transactions involving federal funds sold and purchased  repurchase agreements  correspondent bank relationships  and derivative contracts with companies in the financial services industry 
old national s net counterparty exposure was an asset of million at december  
table of contents lending activities commercial commercial and industrial loans are made primarily for the purpose of financing equipment acquisition  expansion  working capital  and other general business purposes 
lease financing consists of direct financing leases and are used by commercial customers to finance capital purchases ranging from computer equipment to transportation equipment 
the credit decisions for these transactions are based upon an assessment of the overall financial capacity of the applicant 
a determination is made as to the applicant s ability to repay in accordance with the proposed terms as well as an overall assessment of the risks involved 
in addition to an evaluation of the applicant s financial condition  a determination is made of the probable adequacy of the primary and secondary sources of repayment  such as additional collateral or personal guarantees  to be relied upon in the transaction 
credit agency reports of the applicant s credit history supplement the analysis of the applicant s creditworthiness 
commercial mortgages and construction loans are offered to real estate investors  developers  and builders primarily domiciled in the geographic market areas we serve  primarily indiana  illinois and kentucky 
these loans are secured by first mortgages on real estate at loan to value ltv margins deemed appropriate for the property type  quality  location and sponsorship 
generally  these ltv ratios do not exceed 
the commercial properties are predominantly non residential properties such as retail centers  apartments  industrial properties and  to a lesser extent  more specialized properties 
substantially all of our commercial real estate loans are secured by properties located in our primary market area 
in the underwriting of our commercial real estate loans  we obtain appraisals for the underlying properties 
decisions to lend are based on the economic viability of the property and the creditworthiness of the borrower 
in evaluating a proposed commercial real estate loan  we primarily emphasize the ratio of the property s projected net cash flows to the loan s debt service requirement 
the debt service coverage ratio normally is not less than and it is computed after deduction for a vacancy factor and property expenses as appropriate 
in addition  a personal guarantee of the loan or a portion thereof is often required from the principal s of the borrower 
we require title insurance insuring the priority of our lien  fire  and extended coverage casualty insurance  and flood insurance  if appropriate  in order to protect our security interest in the underlying property 
in addition  business interruption insurance or other insurance may be required 
construction loans are underwritten against projected cash flows derived from rental income  business income from an owner occupant or the sale of the property to an end user 
we may mitigate the risks associated with these types of loans by requiring fixed price construction contracts  performance and payment bonding  controlled disbursements  and pre sale contracts or pre lease agreements 
consumer we offer a variety of first mortgage and junior lien loans to consumers within our markets  with residential home mortgages comprising our largest consumer loan category 
these loans are secured by a primary residence and are underwritten using traditional underwriting systems to assess the credit risks of the consumer 
decisions are primarily based on ltv ratios  debt to income dti ratios  liquidity and credit scores 
a maximum ltv ratio of is generally required  although higher levels are permitted with mortgage insurance 
we offer fixed rate mortgages and variable rate mortgages with interest rates that are subject to change every year after the first  third  fifth  or seventh year  depending on the product and are based on fully indexed rates such as the london interbank offered rate libor 
we do not offer interest only loans  payment option facilities  sub prime loans  or any product with negative amortization 
home equity loans are secured primarily by second mortgages on residential property of the borrower 
the underwriting terms for the home equity product generally permits borrowing availability  in the aggregate  up to of the appraised value of the collateral property at the time of origination 
we offer fixed and variable rate home equity loans  with variable rate loans underwritten at fully indexed rates 
decisions are primarily based on ltv ratios  dti ratios  liquidity  and credit scores 
we do not offer home equity loan products with reduced documentation 

table of contents automobile loans include loans and leases secured by new or used automobiles 
we originate automobile loans and leases primarily on an indirect basis through selected dealerships 
we require borrowers to maintain collision insurance on automobiles securing consumer loans  with us listed as loss payee 
our procedures for underwriting automobile loans include an assessment of an applicant s overall financial capacity  including credit history and the ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan 
although an applicant s creditworthiness is the primary consideration  the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral security to the proposed loan amount 
asset quality community based lending personnel  along with region based independent underwriting and analytic support staff  extend credit under guidelines established and administered by our risk and credit policy committee 
this committee  which meets quarterly  is made up of outside directors 
the committee monitors credit quality through its review of information such as delinquencies  credit exposures  peer comparisons  problem loans and charge offs 
in addition  the committee reviews and approves recommended loan policy changes to assure it remains appropriate for the current lending environment 
we lend primarily to small and medium sized commercial and commercial real estate clients in various industries including manufacturing  agribusiness  transportation  mining  wholesaling and retailing 
at december   we had no concentration of loans in any single industry exceeding of our portfolio and had no exposure to foreign borrowers or sovereign debt 
our policy is to concentrate our lending activity in the geographic market areas we serve  primarily indiana  illinois and kentucky 
we continue to be affected by weakness in the economy of our principal markets 
management expects that trends in under performing  criticized and classified loans will be influenced by the degree to which the economy strengthens or weakens 
on january   old national closed on its acquisition of monroe bancorp 
as of december   acquired loans totaled million and there was million of other real estate owned 
in accordance with accounting for business combinations  there was no allowance brought forward on any of the acquired loans  as the credit losses evident in the loans were included in the determination of the fair value of the loans at the acquisition date 
old national reviewed the acquired loans and determined that as of december   million met the definition of criticized  million were considered classified  and million were doubtful

at december   we expect eighty percent of any losses incurred on these covered assets to be reimbursed to old national by the fdic 
these covered loans are categorized as nonaccrual because the collection of principal or interest is doubtful 
covered loans are accounted for under fasb asc and accordingly treated as performing assets 

table of contents nonaccrual loans increased million from december  to december  primarily as a result of our january  acquisition of monroe bancorp and our july  fdic assisted acquisition of integra bank

of this increase in our oreo balances  million related to the foreclosed properties acquired from monroe bancorp and million related to the covered assets acquired in the integra bank transaction 
old national may choose to restructure the contractual terms of certain loans 
the decision to restructure a loan  versus aggressively enforcing the collection of the loan  may benefit old national by increasing the ultimate probability of collection 
any loans that are modified are reviewed by old national to identify if a troubled debt restructuring tdr has occurred  which is when for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower s financial difficulties  the bank grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider 
terms may be modified to fit the ability of the borrower to repay in line with its current financial status 
during the twelve months ended december   the terms of certain loans were modified as troubled debt restructurings 
the modification of the terms of such loans included one or a combination of the following a reduction of the stated interest rate of the loan  an extension of the maturity date at a stated rate of interest lower than the current market rate of new debt with similar risk  or a permanent reduction of the recorded investment of the loan 
loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring are typically placed on nonaccrual status until the company determines the future collection of principal and interest is reasonably assured  which generally requires that the borrower demonstrate a period of performance according to the restructured terms for six months 
if the company is unable to resolve a nonperforming loan issue the credit will be charged off when it is apparent there will be a loss 
for large commercial type loans  each relationship is individually analyzed for evidence of apparent loss based on quantitative benchmarks or subjectively based upon certain events or particular circumstances 
it is old national s policy to charge off small commercial loans scored through our small business credit center with contractual balances under  that have been placed on nonaccrual status or became ninety days or more delinquent  without regard to the collateral position 
for residential and consumer loans  a charge off is recorded at the time foreclosure is initiated or when the loan becomes to days past due  whichever is earlier 
for commercial and industrial troubled debt restructurings  an allocated reserve is established within the allowance for loan losses for the difference between the carrying value of the loan and its computed fair value 
to determine the fair value of the loan  one of the following methods is selected the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loans original effective interest rate  the loan s observable market price  or the fair value of the collateral value  if the loan is collateral dependent 
the allocated reserve is established as the difference between the carrying value of the loan and the collectable value 
if there are significant changes in the amount or timing of the loan s expected future cash flows  impairment is recalculated and the valuation allowance is adjusted accordingly 

table of contents for consumer and residential troubled debt restructurings  an additional amount is added to the loan loss reserve that represents the difference in the present value of the cash flows between the original terms and the new terms of the modified loan  using the original effective interest rate of the loan as a discount rate 
at december   our troubled debt restructurings consisted of million of commercial loans  million of commercial real estate loans and million of consumer loans 
approximately million of the troubled debt restructuring at december  were included with nonaccrual loans 
as of december   old national has allocated specific reserves of million to commercial loans and million to commercial real estate loans for loans that have been modified in troubled debt restructurings 
all of our troubled debt restructurings were included with nonaccrual loans at december  and consisted of million of commercial loans and million of commercial real estate loans 
the terms of certain other loans were modified during the twelve months ended december  that did not meet the definition of a troubled debt restructuring 
it is our process to review all classified and criticized loans that  during the period  have been renewed  have entered into a forbearance agreement  have gone from principal and interest to interest only  or have extended the maturity date 
in order to determine whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty  an evaluation is performed of the probability that the borrower will be in payment default on its debt in the foreseeable future without the modification 
the evaluation is performed under the company s internal underwriting policy 
we also evaluate whether a concession has been granted or if we were adequately compensated through a market interest rate  additional collateral or a bona fide guarantee 
we also consider whether the modification was insignificant relative to the other terms of the agreement or if the delay in a payment was days or less 
purchased credit impaired pci loans would not be considered impaired until after the point at which there has been a degradation of cash flows below our expected cash flows at acquisition 
if a pci loan is subsequently modified  and meets the definition of a tdr  it will be removed from pci accounting and accounted for as a tdr only if the pci loan was being accounted for individually 
if the purchased credit impaired loan is being accounted for as part of a pool  it will not be removed from the pool 
in general  once a modified loan is considered a tdr  the loan will always be considered a tdr  and therefore impaired  until it is paid in full  otherwise settled  sold or charged off 
however  our policy also permits for loans to be removed from troubled debt restructuring status in the years following the restructuring if the following two conditions are met the restructuring agreement specifies an interest rate equal to or greater than the rate that the company was willing to accept at the time of the restructuring for a new loan with comparable risk  and the loan is not impaired based on the terms specified by the restructuring agreement 
to provide for the risk of loss inherent in extending credit  we maintain an allowance for loan losses 
the allowance is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb probable losses incurred in the loan portfolio 
management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is an estimate based on reviews of individual loans  pools of homogeneous loans  historical loss experience  and assessments of the impact of current economic conditions on the portfolio 

table of contents the activity in our allowance for loan losses is as follows allowance for loan losses september  september  september  september  september  dollars in thousands balance  january loans charged off commercial commercial real estate residential real estate consumer credit write downs on loans transferred to held for sale total charge offs recoveries on charged off loans commercial commercial real estate residential real estate consumer credit total recoveries net charge offs provision charged to expense allowance of acquired bank balance  december average loans for the year asset quality ratios allowance year end loans allowance average loans net charge offs average loans loans exclude residential loans held for sale and leases held for sale 
net charge offs include write downs on loans transferred to held for sale 
despite the significant increase in impaired assets resulting from the acquisitions during  the allowance for loan losses declined million  or  from december  to december  the decrease is primarily attributable to our legacy loan portfolio where we have experienced a decline in outstanding loan balances 
the lower allowance for loan losses and provision expense were attributable to the following factors the loss factors applied to our performing loan portfolio have decreased during compared to as charge offs were substantially lower  apart from those loans acquired in our two acquisitions  which are substantially accounted for at fair value  our total loans decreased million from december  to december   and the percentage of our loan portfolio consisting of those loans where higher loss factors are applied commercial and commercial real estate loans fell to in compared to in while the percentage of our loan portfolio consisting of those loans where lower loss factors are applied residential loans increased to in compared to in net charge offs totaled million in and million in there were no industry segments representing a significant share of total net charge offs 
net charge offs to average loans declined to for compared to for the allowance to average loans  which ranged from to for the last five years  was at december  management will continue its efforts to reduce the level of non performing loans and may consider the possibility of additional sales of troubled and non performing loans  which could result in additional write downs to the allowance for loan losses 
because the acquired loans from both monroe bancorp and integra bank were recorded at fair value in accordance with asc at the date of acquisition  the credit risk is incorporated in the fair value recorded 
no allowance for loan losses is recorded on the acquisition date 
we would expect that as the fair value mark is accreted into income over future periods  a reserve will be established to absorb credit deterioration or adverse changes in expected cash flows 
through december   million had been reserved for these purchased credits from monroe bancorp 

table of contents the following table provides additional details of the following components of the allowance for loan losses  including fas accounting for contingencies  fas accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan and sop accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx purchased loans legacy covered non covered dollars in thousands fas fas fas fas sop fas fas sop loan balance remaining purchase discount allowance  january  charge offs recoveries provision expense allowance  december  we also maintain an allowance for losses on unfunded commercial lending commitments and letters of credit to provide for the risk of loss inherent in these arrangements 
the allowance is computed using a methodology similar to that used to determine the allowance for loan losses  modified to take into account the probability of a drawdown on the commitment 
the million reserve for unfunded loan commitments at december  is classified as a liability account on the balance sheet 
the reserve for unfunded loan commitments was million at december  the higher reserve is the result of an increase in unfunded commitments associated with the acquisitions of monroe bancorp and integra bank 
the following table details the allowance for loan losses by loan category and the percent of loans in each category compared to total loans at december allocation of the allowance for loan losses by category of loans and the percentage of loans by category to total loans percent percent percent percent of loans of loans of loans of loans to total to total to total to total dollars in thousands amount loans amount loans amount loans amount loans commercial commercial real estate residential real estate consumer credit covered loans total market risk market risk is the risk that the estimated fair value of our assets  liabilities  and derivative financial instruments will decline as a result of changes in interest rates or financial market volatility  or that our net income will be significantly reduced by interest rate changes 
the objective of our interest rate management process is to maximize net interest income while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity 
potential cash flows  sales  or replacement value of many of our assets and liabilities  especially those that earn or pay interest  are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates 
this interest rate risk arises primarily from our normal business activities of gathering deposits and extending loans 
many factors affect our exposure to changes in interest rates  such as general economic and financial conditions  customer preferences  historical pricing relationships  and re pricing characteristics of financial instruments 
our earnings can also be affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of the us government and its agencies  particularly the federal reserve board 

table of contents in managing interest rate risk  we  through the funds management committee  a committee of the board of directors  establish guidelines  for asset and liability management  including measurement of short and long term sensitivities to changes in interest rates 
based on the results of our analysis  we may use different techniques to manage changing trends in interest rates including adjusting balance sheet mix or altering interest rate characteristics of assets and liabilities  changing product pricing strategies  modifying characteristics of the investment securities portfolio  or using derivative financial instruments  to a limited degree 
a key element in our ongoing process is to measure and monitor interest rate risk using a net interest income at risk simulation to model the interest rate sensitivity of the balance sheet and to quantify the impact of changing interest rates on the company 
the model quantifies the effects of various possible interest rate scenarios on projected net interest income over a one year and a two year cumulative horizon 
the model assumes a semi static balance sheet and measures the impact on net interest income relative to a base case scenario of hypothetical changes in interest rates over months 
the scenarios include prepayment assumptions  changes in the level of interest rates  the shape of the yield curve  and spreads between market interest rates in order to capture the impact from re pricing  yield curve  option  and basis risks 
results of our simulation modeling  which assumes an immediate  parallel shift in market interest rates  project that our net interest income could change as follows over one year and two year horizons  relative to our base case scenario 
xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx changes in net interest income one year horizon two year cumulative horizon change change change change immediate change in the level of interest rates s change s change s change s change na na na na na na na na at december   our simulated exposure to an increase in interest rates shows that an immediate increase in rates of will increase our net interest income by million or 
over a one year horizon compared to a flat interest rate scenario 
furthermore  rate increases of and would cause net interest income to decline by and respectively 
over a two year horizon  the model reflects increases in net interest income for the up and scenarios of and respectively 
if rates increase by  our model indicates that net interest income would fall by 
as a result of the already low interest rate environment  we did not include a falling scenario 
the changes in the rate sensitivity of the balance sheet from december  to december   are primarily attributable to the acquisitions of monroe bancorp and integra bank  a smaller investment portfolio  less reliance on wholesale funding  and significant changes in the mix of assets and liabilities 
the company s interest rate risk modeling indicates that its net interest income would be negatively impacted by a scenario where short term interest rates remain constant while long term rates decrease by up to at the thirty year point 
assuming such a scenario with a static balance sheet  the company s net income will decrease by million or in year one and million or in year two compared to the current interest rate scenario 
this decrease in net interest income is primarily due to new or re pricing assets being acquired or re priced on the balance sheet at lower interest rate levels while the interest rates on much of the deposits and borrowings funding these assets have already re priced to low levels 

table of contents we continue to execute strategies to position the company in the current low rate environment to be relatively neutral to interest rate increases 
for example  management has focused on reducing the size and duration of the investment portfolio at the same time it has increased its holdings of fixed rate  residential real estate mortgages 
modeling results as of december   indicate that we remain within our company s acceptable risk tolerance levels 
old national also has longer term interest rate risk exposure  which may not be appropriately measured by net interest income at risk modeling 
we use economic value of equity eve sensitivity analysis to evaluate the impact of long term cash flows on earnings and capital 
eve modeling involves discounting present values of all cash flows for on balance sheet and off balance sheet items under different interest rate scenarios 
the discounted present value of all cash flows represents our economic value of equity 
the amount of base case economic value and its sensitivity to shifts in interest rates provide a measure of the longer term re pricing and option risk in the balance sheet 
eve simulation results are shown below  relative to base case 
september  september  september  september  economic value of equity change change immediate change in the level of interest rates millions change millions change na na na na at december   old national s economic value of equity eve scenarios indicated positive changes to eve in all interest rate scenarios 
as of december   eve changes were negative in all rate scenarios 
as noted previously  these changes in eve modeling results were driven primarily by the acquisitions of monroe bancorp and integra bank  a smaller investment portfolio and changes in the mix of the balance sheet 
modeling results at december   indicate that we remain within our company s acceptable risk tolerance levels 
because the models are driven by expected behavior in various interest rate scenarios and many factors besides market interest rates affect our net interest income and value  we recognize that model outputs are not guarantees of actual results 
for this reason  we model many different combinations of interest rates and balance sheet assumptions to understand its overall sensitivity to market interest rate changes 
we use derivatives  primarily interest rate swaps  as one method to manage interest rate risk in the ordinary course of business 
we also provide derivatives to our commercial customers in connection with managing interest rate risk 
our derivatives had an estimated fair value gain of million at december   compared to an estimated fair value gain of million at december  in addition  the notional amount of derivatives increased by million from december   primarily as a result of derivative instruments acquired from integra 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of derivative financial instruments 
liquidity risk liquidity risk arises from the possibility that we may not be able to satisfy current or future financial commitments  or may become unduly reliant on alternative funding sources 
the funds management committee of the board of directors establishes liquidity risk guidelines and  along with the balance sheet management committee  monitors liquidity risk 
the objective of liquidity management is to ensure we have the ability to fund balance sheet growth and meet deposit and debt obligations in a timely and cost effective manner 
management monitors liquidity through a regular review of asset and liability maturities  funding sources  and loan and deposit forecasts 
we maintain strategic and contingency liquidity plans to ensure sufficient available funding to satisfy requirements for balance sheet growth  properly manage capital markets funding sources and to address unexpected liquidity requirements 

table of contents loan repayments and maturing investment securities are a relatively predictable source of funds 
however  deposit flows  calls of investment securities and prepayments of loans and mortgage related securities are strongly influenced by interest rates  the housing market  general and local economic conditions  and competition in the marketplace 
we continually monitor marketplace trends to identify patterns that might improve the predictability of the timing of deposit flows or asset prepayments 
our ability to acquire funding at competitive prices is influenced by rating agencies views of our credit quality  liquidity  capital and earnings 
all of the rating agencies place us in an investment grade that indicates a low risk of default

table of contents federal banking laws regulate the amount of dividends that may be paid by banking subsidiaries without prior approval 
prior regulatory approval is required if dividends to be declared in any year would exceed net earnings of the current year plus retained net profits for the preceding two years 
during the first quarter of old national received a million dividend from the bank subsidiary to repurchase the million of non voting preferred shares from the treasury 
in order to pay this special dividend  old national bank was required to seek approval from its regulatory authority 
such approval was also obtained for the payment of dividends during and prior regulatory approval to pay dividends will not be required in off balance sheet arrangements off balance sheet arrangements include commitments to extend credit and financial guarantees 
commitments to extend credit and financial guarantees are used to meet the financial needs of our customers 
our banking affiliates have entered into various agreements to extend credit  including loan commitments of billion and standby letters of credit of million at december  at december   approximately billion of the loan commitments had fixed rates and million had floating rates  with the fixed interest rates ranging from to 
at december   loan commitments were billion and standby letters of credit were million 
the term of these off balance sheet arrangements is typically one year or less

we are party to various derivative contracts as a means to manage the balance sheet and our related exposure to changes in interest rates  to manage our residential real estate loan origination and sale activity  and to provide derivative contracts to our clients 
since the derivative liabilities recorded on the balance sheet change frequently and do not represent the amounts that may ultimately be paid under these contracts  these liabilities are not included in the table of contractual obligations presented above 
further discussion of derivative instruments is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in the normal course of business  various legal actions and proceedings are pending against us and our affiliates which are incidental to the business in which they are engaged 
further discussion of contingent liabilities is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  liabilities recorded under fasb asc fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no

further discussion of income taxes and liabilities recorded under fasb asc is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  certain accounting policies require management to use significant judgment and estimates  which can have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities 
we consider these policies to be critical accounting policies 
the judgment and assumptions made are based upon historical experience or other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgment and assumptions  actual results could differ from estimates  which could have a material affect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the following accounting policies materially affect our reported earnings and financial condition and require significant judgments and estimates 
management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board 
goodwill and intangibles description 
for acquisitions  we are required to record the assets acquired  including identified intangible assets  and the liabilities assumed at their fair value 
these often involve estimates based on third party valuations  such as appraisals  or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques that may include estimates of attrition  inflation  asset growth rates or other relevant factors 
in addition  the determination of the useful lives over which an intangible asset will be amortized is subjective 
under fasb asc sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and indefinite lived assets recorded must be reviewed for impairment on an annual basis  as well as on an interim basis if events or changes indicate that the asset might be impaired 
an impairment loss must be recognized for any excess of carrying value over fair value of the goodwill or the indefinite lived intangible asset 
judgments and uncertainties 
the determination of fair values is based on internal valuations using management s assumptions of future growth rates  future attrition  discount rates  multiples of earnings or other relevant factors 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions 
changes in these factors  as well as downturns in economic or business conditions  could have a significant adverse impact on the carrying values of goodwill or intangible assets and could result in impairment losses affecting the financials of the company as a whole and the individual lines of business in which the goodwill or intangibles reside 
acquired impaired loans description 
loans acquired with evidence of credit deterioration since inception and for which it is probable that all contractual payments will not be received are accounted for under asc topic  loans and debt securities acquired with deteriorated credit quality asc 
these loans are recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition  with no carryover of the related allowance for loan losses 
fair value of acquired loans is determined using a discounted cash flow methodology based on assumptions 
table of contents about the amount and timing of principal and interest payments  principal prepayments and principal defaults and losses  and current market rates 
in recording the acquisition date fair values of acquired impaired loans  management calculates a non accretable difference the credit component of the purchased loans and an accretable difference the yield component of the purchased loans 
over the life of the acquired loans  the company continues to estimate cash flows expected to be collected on pools of loans sharing common risk characteristics  which are treated in the aggregate when applying various valuation techniques 
the company evaluates at each balance sheet date whether the present value of its pools of loans determined using the effective interest rates has decreased significantly and if so  recognizes a provision for loan loss in its consolidated statement of income 
for any significant increases in cash flows expected to be collected  the company adjusts the amount of accretable yield recognized on a prospective basis over the pool s remaining life 
judgments and uncertainties 
these cash flow evaluations are inherently subjective as they require management to make estimates about expected cash flows  market conditions and other future events that are highly subjective in nature and subject to change 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions 
changes in these factors  as well as changing economic conditions will likely impact the carrying value of these acquired loans as well as the carrying value of any associated indemnification assets  as the fdic will reimburse the company for losses incurred on certain acquired loans  but the shared loss agreements may not fully offset the financial effects of such a situation 
allowance for loan losses description 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb probable incurred losses in the consolidated loan portfolio 
management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is an estimate based on reviews of individual loans  pools of homogeneous loans  assessments of the impact of current and anticipated economic conditions on the portfolio and historical loss experience 
the allowance represents management s best estimate  but significant downturns in circumstances relating to loan quality and economic conditions could result in a requirement for additional allowance 
likewise  an upturn in loan quality and improved economic conditions may allow a reduction in the required allowance 
in either instance  unanticipated changes could have a significant impact on results of operations 
the allowance is increased through a provision charged to operating expense 
uncollectible loans are charged off through the allowance 
recoveries of loans previously charged off are added to the allowance 
a loan is considered impaired when it is probable that contractual interest and principal payments will not be collected either for the amounts or by the dates as scheduled in the loan agreement 
our policy for recognizing income on impaired loans is to accrue interest unless a loan is placed on nonaccrual status 
a loan is generally placed on nonaccrual status when principal or interest becomes days past due unless it is well secured and in the process of collection  or earlier when concern exists as to the ultimate collectibility of principal or interest 
we monitor the quality of our loan portfolio on an on going basis and use a combination of detailed credit assessments by relationship managers and credit officers  historic loss trends  and economic and business environment factors in determining the allowance for loan losses 
we record provisions for loan losses based on current loans outstanding  grade changes  mix of loans and expected losses 
a detailed loan loss evaluation on an individual loan basis for our highest risk loans is performed quarterly 
management follows the progress of the economy and how it might affect our borrowers in both the near and the intermediate term 
we have a formalized and disciplined independent loan review program to evaluate loan administration  credit quality and compliance with corporate loan standards 
this program includes periodic reviews and regular reviews of problem loan reports  delinquencies and charge offs 
judgments and uncertainties 
we use migration analysis as a tool to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses for performing commercial loans 
migration analysis is a statistical technique that attempts to estimate probable losses for existing pools of loans by matching actual losses incurred on loans back to their origination 
judgment is used to select and weight the historical periods which are most representative of the current environment 

table of contents we calculate migration analysis using several different scenarios based on varying assumptions to evaluate the widest range of possible outcomes 
the migration derived historical commercial loan loss rates are applied to the current commercial loan pools to arrive at an estimate of probable losses for the loans existing at the time of analysis 
the amounts determined by migration analysis are adjusted for management s best estimate of the effects of current economic conditions  loan quality trends  results from internal and external review examinations  loan volume trends  credit concentrations and various other factors 
we use historic loss ratios adjusted for expectations of future economic conditions to determine the appropriate level of allowance for consumer and residential real estate loans 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions 
the allowance represents management s best estimate  but significant downturns in circumstances relating to loan quality and economic conditions could result in a requirement for additional allowance 
likewise  an upturn in loan quality and improved economic conditions may allow a reduction in the required allowance 
in either instance  unanticipated changes could have a significant impact on results of operations 
management s analysis of probable losses in the portfolio at december   resulted in a range for allowance for loan losses of million 
the range pertains to general fasb asc  receivables sfas reserves for both retail and performing commercial loans 
specific fasb asc  receivables sfas reserves do not have a range of probable loss 
due to the risks and uncertainty associated with the economy  our projection of fas loss rates inherent in the portfolio  and our selection of representative historical periods  we establish a range of probable outcomes a high end estimate and a low end estimate and evaluate our position within this range 
the potential effect to net income based on our position in the range relative to the high and low endpoints is a decrease of million and an increase of million  respectively  after taking into account the tax effects 
these sensitivities are hypothetical and are not intended to represent actual results 
derivative financial instruments description 
as part of our overall interest rate risk management  we use derivative instruments to reduce exposure to changes in interest rates and market prices for financial instruments 
the application of the hedge accounting policy requires judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness  identification of similar hedged item groupings and measurement of changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments and hedged items 
to the extent hedging relationships are found to be effective  as determined by fasb asc sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  changes in fair value of the derivatives are offset by changes in the fair value of the related hedged item or recorded to other comprehensive income 
management believes hedge effectiveness is evaluated properly in preparation of the financial statements 
all of the derivative financial instruments we use have an active market and indications of fair value can be readily obtained 
we are not using the short cut method of accounting for any fair value derivatives 
judgments and uncertainties 
the application of the hedge accounting policy requires judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness  identification of similar hedged item groupings and measurement of changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments and hedged items 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions 
to the extent hedging relationships are found to be effective  as determined by fasb asc sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  changes in fair value of the derivatives are offset by changes in the fair value of the related hedged item or recorded to other comprehensive income 
however  if in the future the derivative financial instruments used by us no longer qualify for hedge accounting treatment  all changes in fair value of the derivative would flow through the consolidated statements of income in other noninterest income  resulting in greater volatility in our earnings 

table of contents income taxes description 
we are subject to the income tax laws of the us  its states and the municipalities in which we operate 
these tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant government taxing authorities 
we review income tax expense and the carrying value of deferred tax assets quarterly  and as new information becomes available  the balances are adjusted as appropriate 
fasb asc fin prescribes a recognition threshold of more likely than not  and a measurement attribute for all tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return  in order for those tax positions to be recognized in the financial statements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of our provision and related income tax assets and liabilities 
judgments and uncertainties 
in establishing a provision for income tax expense  we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws 
we must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions 
disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be subject to review adjudication by the court systems of the various tax jurisdictions or may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions 
although management believes that the judgments and estimates used are reasonable  actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established  or are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves  our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected 
an unfavorable tax settlement would result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 
a favorable tax settlement would result in a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 
valuation of securities description 
the fair value of our securities is determined with reference to price estimates 
in the absence of observable market inputs related to items such as cash flow assumptions or adjustments to market rates  management judgment is used 
different judgments and assumptions used in pricing could result in different estimates of value 
when the fair value of a security is less than its amortized cost for an extended period  we consider whether there is an other than temporary impairment in the value of the security 
if  in management s judgment  an other than temporary impairment exists  the portion of the loss in value attributable to credit quality is transferred from accumulated other comprehensive loss as an immediate reduction of current earnings and the cost basis of the security is written down by this amount 
we consider the following factors when determining an other than temporary impairment for a security or investment the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  the underlying fundamentals of the relevant market and the outlook for such market for the near future  our intent to sell the debt security or whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery  and when applicable for purchased beneficial interests  the estimated cash flows of the securities are assessed for adverse changes 
quarterly  securities are evaluated for other than temporary impairment in accordance with fasb asc sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and fasb asc emerging issues task force no 
 recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interest in securitized financial assets and fasb asc fsp no 
fas and fas  recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments 

table of contents an impairment that is an other than temporary impairment is a decline in the fair value of an investment below its amortized cost attributable to factors that indicate the decline will not be recovered over the anticipated holding period of the investment 
other than temporary impairments result in reducing the security s carrying value by the amount of credit loss 
the credit component of the other than temporary impairment loss is realized through the statement of income and the remainder of the loss remains in other comprehensive income 
judgments and uncertainties 
the determination of other than temporary impairment is a subjective process  and different judgments and assumptions could affect the timing and amount of loss realization 
in addition  significant judgments are required in determining valuation and impairment  which include making assumptions regarding the estimated prepayments  loss assumptions and interest cash flows 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions 
actual credit deterioration could be more or less severe than estimated
