overview we are a fully integrated self administered and self managed reit and one of the largest owners and developers of class a office properties in the united states 
our properties are concentrated in five markets boston  new york  princeton  san francisco and washington  dc 
we generate revenue and cash primarily by leasing our class a office space to our tenants 
factors we consider when we lease space include the creditworthiness of the tenant  the length of the lease  the rental rate to be paid  the costs of tenant improvements and other landlord concessions  current and anticipated operating costs and real estate taxes  our current and anticipated vacancy  current and anticipated future demand for office space and general economic factors 
from time to time  we also generate cash through the sale of assets 
our core strategy has always been to operate in supply constrained markets with high barriers to entry and to focus on executing long term leases with financially strong tenants 
historically  this combination has tended to reduce our exposure in down cycles and enhance revenues as market conditions improve 
to be successful in the current leasing environment  we believe all aspects of the tenant landlord relationship must be considered 
in this regard  we believe that our understanding of tenants short and long term space needs in the local markets  our relationships with local brokers  our reputation as a premier owner and operator of class a office properties  our financial strength and our ability to maintain high building standards provide us with a competitive advantage 
table of contents in an increasingly fragmented office market 
we expect tenants in our markets to continue to take advantage of the ability to upgrade to high quality space like ours  particularly those who value our operational expertise and financial stability when making their leasing decisions 
leasing trends continue to improve in cambridge  massachusetts and the central business district and suburban submarkets of san francisco  which suggests that there are sectors of the economy that are growing despite the uncertain and challenging macroeconomic issues 
these submarkets are experiencing stronger leasing velocity  additional space demand  increasing rental rates and or lower transaction concessions 
in the midtown manhattan market activity is stable  although velocity slowed during the second half of given our current occupancy in that market of approximately  our leasing in the near term will be generated from smaller spaces where there is good activity 
in washington  dc  the leasing activity in the public sector market has been adversely impacted by the federal budgetary uncertainty and the reductions in discretionary spending programs  and the activity in the private sector market has also been moderate 
overall  during  leases for approximately  square feet of space commenced revenue recognition  including leases for approximately  square feet of second generation space and leases for approximately  square feet of first generation space  stemming mostly from completion of development projects 
these second generation leases had an average lease term of approximately months and included an average of approximately days of free rent and total transaction costs  including tenant improvements and leasing commissions  of approximately per square foot 
transaction costs were relatively low compared to recent historical standards due to a high percentage of leases signed at suburban properties where tenant concessions and brokerage commissions tend to be lower than central business district costs 
the starting gross rents for the approximately  square feet of second generation leases that had been occupied within the prior months decreased on average by approximately compared to the ending gross rents from the previous leases for this space 
lease terms are highly dependent on location ie  whether the property is in a central business district or suburban location  whether the lease is a renewal or with a new tenant  and the length of the lease term 
as of december   leases representing approximately of the space at our properties expire through december  while rental rates in our markets have stabilized and have begun to increase in select submarkets  as leases expire in  assuming no further change in current market rental rates  we expect the rental rates we are likely to achieve on new leases will generally be slightly greater than the rates currently being paid  thereby generally resulting in more revenue from the same space 
we believe the successful lease up and completion of our development pipeline will enhance our long term return on equity and earnings growth as these developments are placed in service through in  we partially or fully placed in service atlantic wharf  the lofts at atlantic wharf  pennsylvania avenue  the residences on the avenue and madison avenue 
in addition  during  we commenced or resumed the development and redevelopment of approximately billion of projects  including approximately billion on our planned  square foot office tower at west th street in midtown manhattan that is currently pre leased 
we also continue to actively explore acquisition opportunities 
during  we acquired two assets  one in waltham  massachusetts and one in mountain view  california  for a total investment of approximately million 
we believe acquisition opportunities will continue to present themselves  however  the combination of relatively low interest rates and the abundance of capital seeking high quality assets may have a dampening effect on return expectations 
while we are primarily focused on opportunities in our existing markets  we are open to investments in new markets both in the united states and possibly outside the united states 
we are primarily interested in investing in markets that share common traits with our existing core markets  namely hour world class cities with highly educated work forces  high barriers to entry and a diverse and strong international tenant base  and in which we would expect to establish an operating platform over time 
while our management team is actively seeking opportunities  they intend to carefully evaluate the risks inherent in 
table of contents investing in any new markets and maintain our disciplined investment strategy  which focuses on high quality assets in supply constrained markets that have historically provided long term value creation 
in addition  we believe that our strong cash balance  availability under our operating partnership s unsecured line of credit and access to both secured and unsecured debt at attractive rates provide us with ample capital to pursue acquisition opportunities 
these same market conditions that make it challenging to acquire assets at attractive yields also provide us with the opportunity to sell assets 
on october   we sold our two grand central tower joint venture asset of which our share was  located in new york city  for million and may consider the sale of other assets in our portfolio 
for descriptions of significant transactions that we completed during  see item business transactions during critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap  requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies  including making estimates and assumptions 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different  it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements 
from time to time  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
real estate upon acquisitions of real estate  we assess the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets  including land  buildings  tenant improvements  above and below market leases  leasing and assumed financing origination costs  acquired in place leases  other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities  and allocate the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities  including land at appraised value and buildings as if vacant 
we assess and consider fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize discount and or capitalization rates that we deem appropriate  as well as available market information 
estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results  known and anticipated trends  and market and economic conditions 
the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant 
we also consider an allocation of purchase price of other acquired intangibles  including acquired in place leases that may have a customer relationship intangible value  including but not limited to the nature and extent of the existing relationship with the tenants  the tenant s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals 
based on our acquisitions to date  our allocation to customer relationship intangible assets has been immaterial 
we record acquired above and below market leases at their fair values using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired equal to the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in place lease and management s estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in place lease  measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below market fixed rate renewal options for below market leases 
other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in place lease values that are based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease 
factors to be considered include estimates of carrying costs during 
table of contents hypothetical expected lease up periods considering current market conditions  and costs to execute similar leases 
in estimating carrying costs  we include real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease up periods  depending on local market conditions 
in estimating costs to execute similar leases  we consider leasing commissions  legal and other related expenses 
management reviews its long lived assets used in operations for impairment following the end of each quarter and when there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates an impairment in value 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of its assets is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
if such criteria are present  an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value 
the evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy  rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods 
since cash flows on properties considered to be long lived assets to be held and used are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether an asset has been impaired  our established strategy of holding properties over the long term directly decreases the likelihood of recording an impairment loss 
if our strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date  an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material 
if we determine that impairment has occurred  the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value 
asc requires that qualifying assets and liabilities and the results of operations that have been sold  or otherwise qualify as held for sale  be presented as discontinued operations in all periods presented if the property operations are expected to be eliminated and we will not have significant continuing involvement following the sale 
the components of the property s net income that is reflected as discontinued operations include the net gain or loss upon the disposition of the property held for sale  operating results  depreciation and interest expense if the property is subject to a secured loan 
we generally consider assets to be held for sale when the transaction has been approved by our board of directors  or a committee thereof  and there are no known significant contingencies relating to the sale  such that the property sale within one year is considered probable 
following the classification of a property as held for sale  no further depreciation is recorded on the assets and the asset is written down to the lower of carrying value or fair market value 
real estate is stated at depreciated cost 
a variety of costs are incurred in the acquisition  development and leasing of properties 
the cost of buildings and improvements includes the purchase price of property  legal fees and other acquisition costs 
effective january   we are required to expense costs that an acquirer incurs to effect a business combination such as legal  due diligence and other closing related costs 
costs directly related to the development of properties are capitalized 
capitalized development costs include interest  internal wages  property taxes  insurance  and other project costs incurred during the period of development 
after the determination is made to capitalize a cost  it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited 
determination of when a development project commences and capitalization begins  and when a development project is substantially complete and held available for occupancy and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment 
our capitalization policy on development properties is guided by guidance in asc capitalization of interest and asc real estate general formerly known as sfas no 
capitalization of interest cost and sfas no 
accounting for costs and the initial rental operations of real estate projects 
the costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs 
the capitalized costs include pre construction costs necessary to the development of the property  development costs  construction costs  interest costs  real estate taxes  salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development 
we begin the capitalization of costs during the pre construction period which we define as activities that are necessary to the development of the property 
we consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy upon the completion of tenant improvements  but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity 
we cease capitalization on the portion substantially completed  occupied or held available for occupancy  and we capitalize only those costs associated with the portion under construction  or if activities necessary for the development of the property have been suspended 

table of contents investments in unconsolidated joint ventures we consolidate variable interest entities in which we are considered to be the primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary is defined by the entity having both of the following characteristics the power to direct the activities that  when taken together  most significantly impact the variable interest entity s performance  and the obligation to absorb losses and right to receive the returns from the variable interest entity that would be significant to the variable interest entity 
except for ownership interests in variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary  we account for our investments in joint ventures under the equity method of accounting because it exercises significant influence over  but does not control  these entities 
our judgment with respect to our level of influence or control of an entity involves the consideration of various factors including the form of the our ownership interest  our representation in the entity s governance  the size of our investment including loans  estimates of future cash flows  our ability to participate in policy making decisions and the rights of the other investors to participate in the decision making process and to replace us as manager and or liquidate the venture  if applicable 
our assessment of our influence or control over an entity affects the presentation of these investments in our consolidated financial statements 
these investments are recorded initially at cost  as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures  and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions 
any difference between the carrying amount of these investments on our balance sheet and the underlying equity in net assets is amortized as an adjustment to equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures over the life of the related asset 
under the equity method of accounting  our net equity is reflected within the consolidated balance sheets  and our share of net income or loss from the joint ventures is included within the consolidated statements of operations 
the joint venture agreements may designate different percentage allocations among investors for profits and losses  however  our recognition of joint venture income or loss generally follows the joint venture s distribution priorities  which may change upon the achievement of certain investment return thresholds 
we may account for cash distributions in excess of our investment in an unconsolidated joint venture as income when we are not the general partner in a limited partnership and when we have neither the requirement nor the intent to provide financial support to the joint venture 
our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures are reviewed for impairment periodically and we record impairment charges when events or circumstances change indicating that a decline in the fair value below the carrying values have occurred and such decline is other than temporary 
the ultimate realization of our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures is dependent on a number of factors  including the performance of each investment and market conditions 
we will record an impairment charge if we determine that a decline in the value below the carrying value of an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture is other than temporary 
to the extent that we contribute assets to a joint venture  our investment in the joint venture is recorded at our cost basis in the assets that were contributed to the joint venture 
to the extent that our cost basis is different than the basis reflected at the joint venture level  the basis difference is amortized over the life of the related asset and included in our share of equity in net income of the joint venture 
we will recognize gains on the contribution of real estate to joint ventures  relating solely to the outside partner s interest  to the extent the economic substance of the transaction is a sale 
the combined summarized financial information of the unconsolidated joint ventures is disclosed in note of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition contractual rental revenue is reported on a straight line basis over the terms of our respective leases 
we recognize rental revenue of acquired in place above and below market leases at their fair values over the terms of the respective leases 
accrued rental income as reported on the consolidated balance sheets represents rental income recognized in excess of rent payments actually received pursuant to the terms of the individual lease agreements 
for the year ended december   we recorded approximately million of rental revenue representing the adjustments of rents from above and below market leases 
for the year ended 
table of contents december   the impact of the straight line rent adjustment increased rental revenue by approximately million 
these amounts exclude the adjustment of rents from above and below market leases and straight line income from unconsolidated joint ventures  which are disclosed in note of the consolidated financial statements 
our leasing strategy is generally to secure creditworthy tenants that meet our underwriting guidelines 
furthermore  following the initiation of a lease  we continue to actively monitor the tenant s creditworthiness to ensure that all tenant related assets are recorded at their realizable value 
when assessing tenant credit quality  we review relevant financial information  including financial ratios  net worth  revenue  cash flows  leverage and liquidity  evaluate the depth and experience of the tenant s management team  and assess the strength growth of the tenant s industry 
as a result of the underwriting process  tenants are then categorized into one of three categories low risk tenants  the tenant s credit is such that we require collateral  in which case we require a security deposit  and or reduce upfront tenant improvement investments  or the tenant s credit is below our acceptable parameters 
we consistently monitor the credit quality of our tenant base 
we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts arising from estimated losses that could result from the tenant s inability to make required current rent payments and an allowance against accrued rental income for future potential losses that we deem to be unrecoverable over the term of the lease 
tenant receivables are assigned a credit rating of through a rating of represents the highest possible rating and no allowance is recorded 
a rating of represents the lowest credit rating  in which case we record a full reserve against the receivable balance 
among the factors considered in determining the credit rating include payment history  credit status and change in status credit ratings for public companies and company financial statements are used as a primary metric  change in tenant space utilization ie  expansion downsize sublease activity  tenant financial performance  economic conditions in a specific geographic region  and industry specific credit considerations 

table of contents if our estimates of collectability differ from the cash received  then the timing and amount of our reported revenue could be impacted 
the average remaining term of our in place tenant leases  including unconsolidated joint ventures  was approximately years as of december  the credit risk is mitigated by the high quality of our existing tenant base  reviews of prospective tenants risk profiles prior to lease execution and consistent monitoring of our portfolio to identify potential problem tenants 
recoveries from tenants  consisting of amounts due from tenants for common area maintenance  real estate taxes and other recoverable costs  are recognized as revenue in the period during which the expenses are incurred 
tenant reimbursements are recognized and presented in accordance with guidance in asc principal agent considerations asc formerly known as emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  or issue 
asc requires that these reimbursements be recorded on a gross basis  as we are generally the primary obligor with respect to purchasing goods and services from third party suppliers  have discretion in selecting the supplier and have credit risk 
we also receive reimbursement of payroll and payroll related costs from third parties which we reflect on a net basis 
our hotel revenues are derived from room rentals and other sources such as charges to guests for long distance telephone service  fax machine use  movie and vending commissions  meeting and banquet room revenue and laundry services 
hotel revenues are recognized as earned 
we receive management and development fees from third parties 
property management fees are recorded and earned based on a percentage of collected rents at the properties under management  and not on a straight line basis  because such fees are contingent upon the collection of rents 
we review each development agreement and record development fees as earned depending on the risk associated with each project 
profit on development fees earned from joint venture projects is recognized as revenue to the extent of the third party partners ownership interest 
gains on sales of real estate are recognized pursuant to the provisions included in asc real estate sales asc formerly known as sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate 
the specific timing of the sale is measured against various criteria in asc related to the terms of the transaction and any continuing involvement in the form of management or financial assistance associated with the properties 
if the criteria for the full accrual method are not met  we defer some or all of the gain recognition and account for the continued operations of the property by applying the finance  leasing  profit sharing  deposit  installment or cost recovery methods  as appropriate  until the sales criteria are met 
depreciation and amortization we compute depreciation and amortization on our properties using the straight line method based on estimated useful asset lives 
we allocate the acquisition cost of real estate to land  building  tenant improvements  acquired above and below market leases  origination costs and acquired in place leases based on an assessment of their fair value and depreciate or amortize these assets over their useful lives 
the amortization of acquired above and below market leases and acquired in place leases is recorded as an adjustment to revenue and depreciation and amortization  respectively  in the consolidated statements of operations 
fair value of financial instruments for purposes of disclosure  we calculate the fair value of our mortgage notes payable and unsecured senior notes 
we discount the spread between the future contractual interest payments and hypothetical future interest payments on our mortgage debt and unsecured notes based on a current market rate 
in determining the current market rate  we add our estimate of a market spread to the quoted yields on federal government treasury securities with similar maturity dates to our own debt 
because our valuations of our financial instruments are based on these types of estimates  the actual fair value of our financial instruments may differ materially if our estimates do not prove to be accurate 

table of contents derivative instruments and hedging activities derivative instruments and hedging activities require management to make judgments on the nature of its derivatives and their effectiveness as hedges 
these judgments determine if the changes in fair value of the derivative instruments are reported in the consolidated statements of operations as a component of net income or as a component of comprehensive income and as a component of equity on the consolidated balance sheets 
while management believes its judgments are reasonable  a change in a derivative s effectiveness as a hedge could materially affect expenses  net income and equity 
we account for the effective portion of changes in the fair value of a derivative in other comprehensive income loss and subsequently reclassify the effective portion to earnings over the term that the hedged transaction affects earnings 
we account for the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of a derivative directly in earnings 
results of operations the following discussion is based on our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   and at december   and  we owned or had interests in a portfolio of  and properties  respectively the total property portfolio 
as a result of changes within our total property portfolio  the financial data presented below shows significant changes in revenue and expenses from period to period 
accordingly  we do not believe that our period to period financial data with respect to the total property portfolio are necessarily meaningful 
therefore  the comparisons of operating results for the years ended  and show separately the changes attributable to the properties that were owned by us throughout each period compared the same property portfolio and the changes attributable to the properties included in the acquired  placed in service  sold or development or redevelopment portfolios 
in our analysis of operating results  particularly to make comparisons of net operating income between periods meaningful  it is important to provide information for properties that were in service and owned by us throughout each period presented 
we refer to properties acquired or placed in service prior to the beginning of the earliest period presented and owned by us through the end of the latest period presented as our same property portfolio 
the same property portfolio therefore excludes properties placed in service  acquired or in development or redevelopment after the beginning of the earliest period presented or disposed of prior to the end of the latest period presented 
net operating income  or noi  is a non gaap financial measure equal to net income attributable to boston properties  inc  the most directly comparable gaap financial measure  plus income attributable to noncontrolling interests  losses from early extinguishments of debt  losses gains from investments in securities  suspension of development  depreciation and amortization  interest expense  acquisition costs and general and administrative expense  less gains on sales of real estate  income from unconsolidated joint ventures  interest and other income and development and management services revenue 
we use noi internally as a performance measure and believe noi provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level 
therefore  we believe noi is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of our real estate assets 
our management also uses noi to evaluate regional property level performance and to make decisions about resource allocations 
further  we believe noi is useful to investors as a performance measure because  when compared across periods  noi reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates  rental rates  operating costs and acquisition and development activity on an unleveraged basis  providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income attributable to boston properties  inc noi excludes certain components from net income attributable to boston properties  inc in order to provide results that are more closely related to our properties results of operations 
for example  interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level as opposed to the property level 
in addition  depreciation and amortization  because of historical cost accounting and useful life 
table of contents estimates  may distort operating performance at the property level 
noi presented by us may not be comparable to noi reported by other reits that define noi differently 
we believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results  noi should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to boston properties  inc as presented in our consolidated financial statements 
noi should not be considered as an alternative to net income attributable to boston properties  inc as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions 
for a reconciliation of noi to net income attributable to boston properties inc  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  the table below shows selected operating information for the same property portfolio and the total property portfolio 
the same property portfolio consists of properties totaling approximately million net rentable square feet of space  excluding unconsolidated joint ventures and structured parking 
the same property portfolio includes properties acquired or placed in service on or prior to january  and owned and in service through december  the total property portfolio includes the effects of the other properties either placed in service  acquired or in development or redevelopment after january  or disposed of on or prior to december  there were no consolidated properties that were sold after january  this table includes a reconciliation from the same property portfolio to the total property portfolio by also providing information for the year ended december  and with respect to the properties which were placed in service  acquired or in development or redevelopment

table of contents same property portfolio rental revenue rental revenue from the same property portfolio increased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the increase was primarily the result of an increase of approximately million in rental revenue from our leases  coupled with increases in parking and other revenue and other recoveries of approximately million and million  respectively 
the increase in rental revenue from our leases of approximately million is the result of our average revenue increasing by approximately per square foot  contributing approximately million  offset by an approximately million decrease due to a decline in occupancy from to we expect rental revenue from the same property portfolio to decline for as a result of the expiration of leases at embarcadero center four in san francisco and gateway center in south san francisco  the expiration of an approximately  square foot lease at huntington avenue in boston in october and the expiration of an approximately  square foot lease at park avenue in new york city in mid although we have re leased a portion of the embarcadero center four and park avenue space and we have re leased the entire huntington avenue space  there will be an interruption in revenue in in addition  we have a large tenant vacating approximately  square feet of space  in reston  virginia  of which we will be redeveloping approximately  square feet for the defense intelligence agency at and sunrise valley drive 
we have begun the redevelopment of the first phase of the two building redevelopment and removed the first building from service  and therefore also removed it from the same property portfolio  in july the second building  sunrise valley drive  will be similarly removed from service in the first quarter of the third building  sunrise valley drive  is currently leased until the second quarter and we do not expect to receive any income from this building following expiration of the lease through the end of with an approximately  square foot lease commencing at huntington avenue in january and the leasing activity we are currently experiencing in san francisco and boston  we expect our occupancy to then begin improving during however  the impact on the same property portfolio net operating income from the foregoing vacancies and transactions is expected to result in a decrease of approximately to from to termination income termination income increased by approximately million for the year ended december  compared to termination income for the year ended december  related to sixteen tenants across the same property portfolio and totaled approximately million  which included approximately million of termination income related to a default by a  square foot law firm tenant in one of our new york city properties and approximately million related to us entering into lease amendments we signed on july  with the existing tenant at our three building complex in reston  virginia  which will be redeveloped as the headquarters for the defense intelligence agency 
under the agreements  the existing tenant will terminate early its leases for approximately  square feet at the complex and be responsible for certain payments to us aggregating approximately million 
one of the buildings has already been taken out of service and therefore the operating results of that property  including any termination income received  is shown under the properties in development or redevelopment portfolio 
we anticipate recognizing the remaining approximately million in the first quarter of once sunrise valley drive is placed in redevelopment  it will no longer be considered part of the same property portfolio and any operating results will be shown under the properties in development or redevelopment portfolio

gains from investments in securities we account for investments in trading securities at fair value  with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value recognized currently in earnings 
the designation of trading securities is generally determined at acquisition 
during the year ended december   investment in securities was comprised of an investment in an unregistered money market fund and investments in an account associated with our deferred compensation plan 
in december  the unregistered money market fund suspended cash redemptions by investors  investors could elect in kind redemptions of the underlying securities or maintain their investment in the fund and receive distributions as the underlying securities matured or were liquidated by the fund sponsor 
as a result  we retained this investment for a longer term than originally intended  and the valuation of our investment was subject to changes in market conditions 
because interests in this fund were previously valued at less than their par value  we recognized gains of approximately million on our investment during the year ended december  as of december   we no longer had investments in this unregistered money market fund 
the remainder of the gains from investments in securities for the years ended december  and related to investments that we have made to reduce our market risk relating to a deferred compensation plan that we maintain for our officers 
under this deferred compensation plan  each officer who is eligible to participate is permitted to defer a portion of the officer s current income on a pre tax basis and receive a tax deferred return on these deferrals based on the performance of specific investments selected by the officer 
in order to reduce our market risk relating to this plan  we typically acquire  in a separate account that is not restricted as to its use  similar or identical investments as those selected by each officer 
this enables us to generally match our liabilities to our officers under the deferred compensation plan with equivalent assets and thereby limit our market risk 
the performance of these investments is recorded as gains or losses from investments in securities 
during the years ended december  and we recognized gains of approximately million and million  respectively  on these investments

liquidity and capital resources general our principal liquidity needs for the next twelve months and beyond are to fund normal recurring expenses  meet debt service and principal repayment obligations  including balloon payments on maturing debt  fund capital expenditures  including major renovations  tenant improvements and leasing costs  fund development costs  fund possible property acquisitions  and make the minimum distribution required to maintain our reit qualification under the internal revenue code of  as amended 
we expect to satisfy these needs using one or more of the following construction loans  long term secured and unsecured indebtedness including unsecured exchangeable indebtedness  cash flow from operations  distribution of cash flows from joint ventures  cash and cash equivalent balances  sales of real estate  issuances of our equity securities and or additional preferred or common units of partnership interest in our operating partnership  and our unsecured line of credit or other short term bridge facilities 
we believe that our liquidity needs will be satisfied using our cash on hand  cash flows generated by operations  availability under our unsecured line of credit and cash flows provided by other financing activities 
we draw on multiple financing sources to fund our long term capital needs 
our unsecured line of credit is utilized primarily as a bridge facility to fund acquisition opportunities  to refinance outstanding indebtedness and to meet short term development and working capital needs 
we generally seek to fund our development projects with construction loans  which may be guaranteed 
however  the financing for each particular project ultimately depends on several factors  including  among others  the project s size and duration and our access to other sources of cost effective capital at the given time

project cost includes original investment in the joint venture 
investment to date excludes approximately million of costs that were expensed in prior periods in connection with the suspension of development activities 
estimated total investment includes approximately million of interest capitalization 
contractual rental revenue  recoveries from tenants  other income from operations  available cash balances and draws on our operating partnership s unsecured line of credit are our principal sources of capital used to pay operating expenses  debt service  recurring capital expenditures and the minimum distribution required to enable us to maintain our reit qualification 
we seek to maximize income from our existing properties by maintaining quality standards for our properties that promote high occupancy rates and permit increases in rental rates while reducing tenant turnover and controlling operating expenses 
our sources of revenue also include third party fees generated by our property management  leasing  and development and construction businesses  as well as the sale of assets from time to time 
we believe our revenue  together with our cash balances and proceeds from financing activities  will continue to provide the necessary funds for our short term liquidity needs 
material adverse changes in one or more sources of capital may adversely affect our net cash flows 
such changes  in turn  could adversely affect our ability to fund dividends and distributions  debt service payments and tenant improvements 
in addition  a material adverse change in the cash provided by our operations may affect our ability to comply with the financial performance covenants under our operating partnership s unsecured line of credit and unsecured senior notes 
during the year ended december   we fully utilized our million atm stock offering program by issuing an aggregate of  shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of approximately million and net proceeds of approximately million 
in addition  on june   we established a new atm stock offering program through which we may sell from time to time up to an aggregate of million of our common stock through sales agents over a three year period 
during the year ended december   we 
table of contents issued an aggregate of  shares of common stock under this atm stock offering program for gross proceeds of approximately million and net proceeds of approximately million 
as of february   we have million available for issuance under this program 
we intend to use the net proceeds from the sales for general business purposes  which may include investment opportunities and debt reduction 
pending such uses  we may invest the net proceeds in short term  interest bearing securities 
we believe this program provides us with an additional source of capital 
during the year ended december   excluding financings and refinancing done by our unconsolidated joint ventures  we raised approximately billion through secured and unsecured debt financings 
we have utilized a portion of the proceeds to repay approximately million of secured and unsecured debt 
in addition  in february we repurchased redeemed the remaining million of our operating partnership s exchangeable senior notes due these transactions have elongated our debt maturity schedule and lowered our average cost of debt 
we believe that our strong liquidity  including available cash as of february  of approximately billion  and the approximately million available under our operating partnership s unsecured line of credit provides sufficient capacity to fund our remaining capital requirements on existing development projects  our foreseeable potential development activity and pursue attractive additional investment opportunities 
our most significant capital commitments through the remainder of are to fund our development program of approximately million and repay  repurchase or refinance approximately million of maturing debt 
the completion of our ongoing development through late is expected to be fully funded by cash and available draws from construction loans 
we believe the quality of our assets and our strong balance sheet are attractive to lenders and equity investors current investment selectivity and should enable us to continue to access multiple sources of capital 
reit tax distribution considerations dividend as a reit we are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement that we currently distribute at least of our annual taxable income 
our policy is to distribute at least of our taxable income to avoid paying federal tax 
in december  our board of directors increased our quarterly dividend from per common share to per common share 
our board of directors will continue to evaluate this current dividend rate in light of our actual and projected taxable income  liquidity requirements and other circumstances  and there can be no assurance that the future dividends declared by our board of directors will not differ materially 
sales to the extent that we sell assets at a gain and cannot efficiently use the proceeds in a tax deferred manner for either our development activities or attractive acquisitions  we would  at the appropriate time  decide whether it is better to declare a special dividend  adopt a stock repurchase program  reduce our indebtedness or retain the cash for future investment opportunities 
such a decision will depend on many factors including  among others  the timing  availability and terms of development and acquisition opportunities  our then current and anticipated leverage  the cost and availability of capital from other sources  the price of our common stock and reit distribution requirements 
at a minimum  we expect that we would distribute at least that amount of proceeds necessary for us to avoid paying corporate level tax on the applicable gains realized from any asset sales
