table of contents western region operations segment our western region operations segment includes the operations of our commercial  medicare including medicare part d stand alone prescription drug plans or pdp and medicaid health plans as well as the operations of our health and life insurance companies  primarily in arizona  california  oregon and washington  and the operations of our behavioral health and pharmaceutical services subsidiaries in several states  including arizona  california and oregon 
as of december   we had approximately million risk members and approximately million pdp members in our western region operations segment 
managed health care operations we offer a full spectrum of managed health care products and services 
our strategy is to create affordable and tailored customer solutions by i seeking to provide product offerings that both anticipate and respond to current and emerging market demands  ii pursuing innovative provider relationships that effectively manage the cost of care  and iii building alliances with other stakeholders in the health care system to identify and implement changes to help improve the quality and accessibility of the health care system 
the pricing of our products is designed to reflect the varying costs of health care based on the benefit alternatives in our products 
our health plans offer members coverage for a wide range of health care services including ambulatory and outpatient physician care  hospital care  pharmacy services  behavioral health and ancillary diagnostic and therapeutic services 
our health plans include a matrix package  which allows employers and members to select their desired coverage from a variety of alternatives 
our principal commercial health care products are as follows hmo plans our health maintenance organization or hmo plans offer comprehensive benefits for a fixed fee or premium that does not vary with the extent or frequency of medical services actually received by the member 
we offer hmo plans with differing benefit designs and varying levels of co payments at different premium rates 
these plans are offered generally through contracts with participating network physicians  hospitals and other providers 
when an individual enrolls in one of our hmo plans  he or she selects a primary care physician pcp from among the physicians participating in our network 
pcps generally are family practitioners  general practitioners or pediatricians who provide necessary preventive and primary medical care  and are generally responsible for coordinating other necessary health care services  including making referrals to participating network specialists 
in california  participating providers are typically contracted through medical groups and independent physician associations 
in those cases  enrollees in hmo plans are generally required to secure specialty professional services from physicians in the group  as long as such services are available from group physicians 
a significant majority of our california membership is in hmo plans 
ppo plans our preferred provider organization or ppo plans offer coverage for services received from any health care provider  with benefits generally paid at a higher level when care is received from a participating network provider 
coverage typically is subject to deductibles and co payments or coinsurance 
pos plans our point of service or pos plans blend the characteristics of hmo  ppo and indemnity plans 
members can have comprehensive hmo style benefits for services received from participating network providers with lower co payments particularly within the medical group  but also have coverage  generally at higher co payment or coinsurance levels  for services received outside the network 
in the past several years  continuing weak economic conditions in the united states and  in particular  california  have driven a renewed interest in the managed care model 
the weak economy has caused customers both individuals and employer groups to make health insurance purchasing decisions based on value versus choice 
customers are increasingly choosing health plans that offer the best financial value over a health plan that offers a broader network at a higher premium 
health net has developed and is selling products using high 
table of contents quality tailored networks to meet this need 
these tailored network products use provider networks that share our commitment to quality health care combined with affordability for our members 
these products also incorporate benefit levels that ensure our members have access to the care they need 
we offer tailored network hmo products throughout our western region operations 
these networks can be structured in a variety of ways  including a tiered provider option based on cost and quality  products tailored to targeted populations and networks organized in conjunction with a strategic provider partner 
for example  our hmo silver network is a network of hmo doctors  specialists and hospitals in ten counties in california 
our salud con health net sm product line is a suite of affordable plans targeting the latino community 
it is our fastest growing tailored network product in our western region operations 
our premiercare sm hmo is a tailored network built on a new strategic provider partnership with sutter health in northern california 
premiercare provides lower cost premiums for employers as their employees access medical care through the sutter health system of hospitals  primary care physicians and specialists 
we have also developed tailored network products with strategic provider partners in phoenix  arizona and portland  oregon 
we have also developed products for key employer groups with a large geographic distribution within a particular state 
we assume both underwriting and administrative expense risk in return for the premium revenue we receive from our hmo  pos and ppo products 
we have contractual relationships with health care providers for the delivery of health care to our enrollees in these products 
in california  we utilize a capitation fee model 
under a capitation fee model  we pay a provider group a fixed amount per member on a regular basis  usually monthly  and the provider group accepts the risk of the frequency and cost of member utilization of professional services 
by incentivizing providers to focus on cost management  members are more likely to receive only those services that they actually need rather than extraneous services that drive up costs without any meaningful corresponding health benefit 
see provider relationships for additional information about our capitation fee arrangements

the primary care physicians and ppgs are responsible for making referrals approved by the hmo s or ppg s medical director as required under the terms of our various plans and ppg contracts to specialists and hospitals 
additionally  our tailored network products utilize a network that is smaller than our broader hmo network but contains a comprehensive array of physicians  specialists  hospitals and ancillary providers 
certain of our hmos offer enrollees open access plans under which members are not required to secure prior authorization for access to network physicians in certain specialty areas  or open panels under which members may access any physician in the network  or network physicians in certain specialties  without first consulting their primary care physician 
ppg and physician contracts are generally for a period of at least one year and are automatically renewable unless terminated  with certain requirements for maintenance of good professional standing and compliance with our quality  utilization and administrative procedures 
in california  ppgs generally receive a monthly capitation fee for every member assigned to it 
the capitation fee represents payment in full for all medical and ancillary services specified in the provider agreements 
for these capitation fee arrangements  in cases where the capitated ppg cannot provide the health care services needed  such ppgs generally contract with specialists and other ancillary service providers to furnish the requisite services under capitation agreements or negotiated fee schedules with specialists 
outside of california  most of our hmos reimburse physicians according to a discounted fee for service schedule  although several have capitation arrangements with certain providers and provider groups in their market areas 
a provider group s financial instability or failure to pay secondary 
table of contents providers for services rendered could lead secondary providers to demand payment from us  even though we have made our regular capitated payments to the provider group 
depending on state law  we could be liable for such claims 
in our ppo plans  members are not required to select a primary care physician and generally do not require prior authorization for specialty care 
for services provided under our ppo products and the out of network benefits of our pos products  we ordinarily reimburse physicians pursuant to discounted fee for service arrangements 
hnfs maintains a network of qualified physicians  facilities  and ancillary providers in the prime service areas of our t contract for the tricare north region 
services are provided on a fee for service basis 
as of december   hnfs had  physicians   facilities and  ancillary providers in its tricare network 
our behavioral health subsidiary  mhn  maintains a provider network comprised of approximately  psychiatrists  psychologists and other clinical categories of providers nationwide 
substantially all of these providers are contracted with mhn on an individual or small practice group basis and are paid on a discounted fee for service basis 
members who wish to access certain behavioral health services contact mhn and are referred to contracted providers for evaluation or treatment services 
if a member needs inpatient services  mhn maintains a network of approximately  facilities 
in addition to the physicians that are in our networks  we have also entered into agreements with various third parties that have networks of physicians contracted to them third party networks 
in general  under a third party network arrangement  health net is licensed by the third party to access its network providers and pay the claims of these physicians pursuant to the pricing terms of their contracts with the third party network 
hospital relationships our health plan subsidiaries arrange for hospital care primarily through contracts with selected hospitals in their service areas 
these hospital contracts generally have multi year terms or annual terms with automatic renewals and provide for payments on a variety of bases  including capitation  per diem rates  case rates and discounted fee for service schedules 
covered hospital based care for our members is comprehensive 
it includes the services of hospital based physicians  nurses and other hospital personnel  room and board  intensive care  laboratory and x ray services  diagnostic imaging and generally all other services normally provided by acute care hospitals 
our nurses and medical directors are involved in a wide variety of medical management activities on behalf of our hmo and  to a somewhat lesser extent  ppo members 
these activities can include discharge planning and case management  which often involves the coordination of community support services  including visiting nurses  physical therapy  durable medical equipment and home intravenous therapy 
ancillary and other provider relationships our health plan subsidiaries arrange for ancillary and other provider services  such as ambulance  laboratory  radiology  home health  chiropractic and acupuncture primarily through contracts with selected providers in their service areas 
these contracts generally have multi year terms or annual terms with automatic renewals and provide for payments on a variety of bases  including capitation  per diem rates  case rates and discounted fee for service schedules 
in certain cases  these provider services are included in contracts our health plan subsidiaries have with ppgs and hospitals

table of contents additional information concerning our business competition we operate in a highly competitive environment in an industry currently subject to significant changes from business consolidations  new strategic alliances  market pressures  and regulatory and legislative reform including but not limited to the federal health care reform legislation described below in government regulation 
our health plans face substantial competition from both for profit and nonprofit health plans that offer hmo  ppo  self funded and traditional indemnity insurance products including self insured employers and union trust funds 
we also face substantial competition from both for profit and nonprofit health plans  as well as other non health plan companies with respect to our contracts with the federal government  including our t tricare and mflc contracts  which are subject to periodic re competition 
some of our competitors have substantially larger enrollments and greater financial resources than we do 
we believe that the principal competitive features affecting our ability to retain and increase membership include the range and prices of benefit plans offered  size and quality of provider network  quality of service  responsiveness to customer demands  financial stability  comprehensiveness of coverage  diversity of product offerings  market presence and reputation 
the relative importance of each of these factors and the identity of our key competitors varies by market and product 
we believe that we compete effectively against other health care industry participants 
our primary competitors in california are kaiser permanente  anthem blue cross of california  blue shield of california and unitedhealth group  inc together  these four plans and health net account for a majority of the insured market in california 
based on the number of enrollees  kaiser is the largest managed health care company in california and anthem blue cross of california is the largest ppo provider in california 
there are also a number of small  regional health plans that compete with health net in california  mainly in the small business group market segment 
in addition  two of the major national managed care companies  aetna  inc and cigna corp  are active in california 
while cigna s commercial full risk market share is not as significant as that of our primary competitors in california  we believe that it remains in california primarily to serve its national  self funded accounts with employees in california 
cigna is one of our primary competitors in the large group market and aetna is a competitor in both the small and large group markets 
in arizona  our largest competitor is blue cross blue shield of arizona 
we also compete with unitedhealth group  inc  aetna  inc 
and humana inc our oregon health plan competes primarily with providence  regence blue cross blue shield  kaiser  pacificsource  ods health plans  inc  lifewise and unitedhealth group  inc 
with respect to our t tricare and mflc contracts  our primary competitors include humana  united healthgroup  inc  aetna  inc  magellan health services  valueoptions  inc and triwest healthcare alliance  among others

risk factors 
the markets in which we do business are highly competitive 
if we do not design and price our product offerings competitively  our membership and profitability could decline 
marketing and sales we market our products and services to individuals and employer groups through internal sales staff  independent brokers  agents and consultants and through the internet 
for our group health business  we market our products and services utilizing a three step process 
we first market to potential employer groups  group insurance brokers and consultants 
we then provide information directly to employees once the employer has selected our health coverage 
finally  we engage members and employers in marketing for member and group retention 
for our small group business  members are enrolled in the plan chosen by the employer 
in general  once selected by a large employer group  we solicit enrollees from the employee base directly 
during open enrollment periods when employees are permitted to change health care programs  we use a variety of 
table of contents techniques to attract new enrollees and retain existing members  including  without limitation  direct mail  work day and health fair presentations and telemarketing 
our sales efforts are supported by our marketing division  which engages in product research and development  multicultural marketing  advertising and communications  and member education and retention programs 
premiums for each employer group are generally contracted on a yearly basis and are payable monthly 
we consider numerous factors in setting our monthly premiums  including employer group needs and anticipated health care utilization rates as forecast by us based on the demographic composition of  and our prior experience in  our service areas 
premiums are also affected by applicable state and federal law and regulations that may directly or indirectly affect premium setting 
for example  california law limits experience rating of small group accounts taking the group s past health care utilization and costs into consideration and requires detailed rate filings for individual and family plans and small employer plans 
see item a 
risk factors we face competitive pressure to contain premium prices 
for additional information on regulations and legislation impacting our premium setting 
mandated benefits requiring the coverage of certain benefits as a matter of law  whether desired by the group or not also affect premiums 
for example  in california and elsewhere  mental health parity laws have generally broadened mental health benefits under health insurance policies offered by us and other carriers 
in some of our markets we sell individual policies  which are generally sold through independent brokers and agents 
in some states including california and for certain products  carriers are allowed to individually underwrite these policies ie select applicants to whom coverage will be provided and others who are denied  except with respect to persons under age in other states  there may be a requirement of guaranteed issue with respect to certain lines of business that restricts the carrier s discretion to provide coverage 
in guaranteed issue states  exclusions for preexisting conditions are generally permitted 
in california  current law and regulations allow carriers to individually underwrite policies sold to individuals and families except as noted above as well as large groups  but small group policies may not be underwritten 
the completion of customary underwriting procedures may be a prerequisite to the carrier s exercise of any cancellation or rescission right with respect to an issued policy  and the public interest in this practice has caused and may continue to cause additional legislation  regulation and the development of case law which may further restrict carriers in this regard 
information technology our business depends significantly on effective and efficient information systems 
the information gathered and processed by our information management systems assists us in  among other things  pricing our services  monitoring utilization and other cost factors  processing provider claims  billing our customers on a timely basis and identifying accounts for collection 
our customers and providers also depend upon our information systems for membership verification  claims status and other information 
we have many different information systems that support our various lines of business and these systems require the commitment of significant resources for continual maintenance  upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational needs and evolving industry and regulatory standards 
we have partnered with third parties to support our information technology systems and to help design  build  test  implement and maintain our information management systems  and we are considering expanding our outsourced information technology arrangements 
our merger  acquisition and divestiture activity also requires transitions to or from  and the integration of  various information management systems within our overall enterprise architecture 
in  we continued our multi year effort to consolidate systems across the enterprise  improve enterprise data analytics  strengthen our information security posture and consolidate service centers and associated staff 
in addition  we focused on implementing upcoming regulatory and legal compliance requirements in and will continue these efforts in the department of health and human services has mandated new standards in the electronic transmission of healthcare transactions  including claims  remittance  eligibility  claims status requests and related responses  and privacy and security standards  known as hipaa compliance with the new hipaa electronic data transaction standards was required by january   though cms recently 
table of contents announced that it will not enforce compliance with these standards until march  we have implemented the hipaa requirements to be able to exchange formats with our trading partners 
furthermore  cms has adopted a new coding set for diagnoses  commonly referred to as icd  which significantly expands the number of codes utilized in claims processing 
the new icd coding set is currently required to be implemented by october  we will be required to incur significant additional expenses to implement and support the new icd coding set 
in addition  our implementation and support of the requirements of the aca could require the expenditure of significant resources 
in  we expect to further modernize legacy health plan systems  provide technology renewal for our desktops  networks and servers  and improve our customer service capabilities and contact center voice and desktop agent infrastructure  among other information technology related initiatives

risk factors if we fail to comply with requirements relating to patient privacy and information security  including taking steps to ensure that our business associates who obtain access to sensitive patient information maintain the privacy and security of such information  our reputation and business operations could be materially adversely affected 
medical management we believe that managing health care costs is an essential function for a managed care company 
among the medical management techniques we utilize to contain the growth of health care costs are pre authorization or certification for outpatient and inpatient hospitalizations and a concurrent review of active inpatient hospital stays and discharge planning 
we believe that this authorization process reduces inappropriate use of medical resources and achieves efficiencies in referring cases to the most appropriate providers 
we also contract with third parties to manage certain conditions such as neonatal intensive care unit admissions and stays  as well as chronic conditions such as asthma  diabetes and congestive heart failure 
these techniques are widely used in the managed care industry and are accepted practices in the medical profession 
accreditation we pursue accreditation for certain of our health plans from the national committee for quality assurance ncqa and the utilization review accreditation commission urac 
ncqa and urac are independent  non profit organizations that review and accredit hmos and other health care organizations 
hmos that apply for accreditation of particular product lines receive accreditation if they comply with review requirements and quality standards 
the commercial line of business of our arizona hmo and california medicare subsidiaries have both received ncqa accreditation with a score of excellent  which is the highest score ncqa awards 
hn california s commercial hmo pos  medicaid  and hnl s ppo  lines of business received ncqa accreditation with a score of commendable 
our mhn subsidiary has received urac accreditation 
government regulation our business is subject to comprehensive federal regulation and state regulation in the jurisdictions in which we do business 
these laws and regulations govern how we conduct our businesses and result in additional requirements  restrictions and costs to us 
certain of these laws and regulations are discussed below 
federal legislation and regulation health care reform legislation 
during the first quarter of  the president signed into law both the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 
table of contents collectively  the aca  which is causing and will continue to cause significant changes to the us health care system and alter the dynamics of the health care insurance industry 
the provisions of the new legislation include  among others  imposing significant new taxes and fees on health insurers that may not be deductible for income tax purposes  including a health insurer fee on fully insured premiums and an excise tax on high premium insurance policies  stipulating a minimum medical loss ratio as adopted by the secretary of the us department of health and human services hhs  limiting medicare advantage payment rates  increasing mandated benefits  eliminating medical underwriting for medical insurance coverage decisions  or guaranteed issue  increasing restrictions on rescinding coverage  or rescissions  prohibiting some annual and all lifetime limits on amounts paid on behalf of or to our members  limiting the ability of health plans to vary premiums based on assessments of underlying risk  limiting the amount of compensation paid to health insurance executives that is tax deductible  expanding regulations that govern premium rate increase requests  in addition to requirements that individuals obtain coverage and the creation of government controlled exchanges where individuals and small business groups may purchase health coverage 
some provisions of the health care reform legislation became effective in  including those that increase the restrictions on rescissions  those that bar health insurance companies from placing lifetime limits on essential benefits  which are only partially defined  those that prohibit annual limits below specified caps for essential benefits for some benefit plans and those that require health plans to cover certain out of network services with no additional co pay to their enrollees 
some provisions that significantly increase federal regulation of the handling of appeals and grievances were to become effective in  but enforcement of certain of the provisions was postponed until july  and a subset of those again until january  additional provisions were effective in  including medical loss ratio definitions and reporting requirements 
others  such as the summary of benefits and coverage sbc provisions outlined in a final rule published in the federal register on february   are effective in some of the potentially more significant changes  including the annual fees on health insurance companies  the excise tax on high premium insurance policies  the guaranteed issue requirements  the requirement that individuals obtain coverage  and the creation of exchanges  as described above  do not become effective until or later 
implementation of other provisions generally varies from as early as enactment or six months from the date of enactment to as late as in advance of the september federal implementation date  we voluntarily provided the option of continuing coverage for adult dependents up to age who are currently enrolled on their parents health care policies 
in addition  we reaffirmed our existing policy against rescinding members without approval from an external third party reviewer  which has been in effect since various aspects of the health care reform legislation could have an adverse impact on our revenues  enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments and the cost of operating our business 
among other things  the legislation will require premium rate review in certain market segments  and require premium rebates in the event minimum medical loss ratios are not met 
we do not believe that we will be required to pay a material amount in rebates with respect to our business  however  we cannot be certain that we will not be required to pay material amounts in rebates in the future 
in addition  the legislation will lower the rates of medicare payments we receive  may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain members  and will increase the amount of certain taxes and fees we pay  which is expected to increase our effective tax rate in future periods 
however  we are unable to estimate the amount of these fees and taxes or the increase in our effective tax rate because material information and guidance regarding the calculations of these fees and taxes has not been issued 
the new legislation will also impose a sales tax on medical device manufacturers and increase the amount of fees pharmaceutical manufacturers pay both of which in turn could increase our medical costs 
we could also face additional competition as competitors seize on opportunities to expand their business as a result of the new legislation  though there remains considerable uncertainty about the impact of these changes on the health insurance market as a whole and what actions our competitors could take 
the response of other companies to the aca and related adjustments to their offerings  if any  could cause meaningful disruption in the local health care markets 
for example  companies could modify their product features or benefits  change their pricing relative to others in the market  adjust their mix of business or even exit segments of the market 
companies could also seek to adjust their operating costs to support reduced premiums by making changes to 
table of contents their distribution arrangements  decreasing spending on non medical product features and services  or otherwise reducing general and administrative expenses 
because of the magnitude  scope and complexity of the new legislation  we also need to dedicate substantial resources and incur material expenses to implement the new legislation  including implementing the current and future regulations that will provide guidance and clarification on important parts of the legislation 
any delay or failure by us to execute our operational and strategic initiatives with respect to health care reform or otherwise appropriately react to the legislation  implementing regulations and actions of our competitors could result in operational disruptions  disputes with our providers or members  regulatory issues  damage to our existing or potential member relationships or other adverse consequences 
there are numerous steps required to implement this legislation  with clarifying regulations and other guidance expected over several years 
additional guidance on certain provisions of the federal reform legislation has been issued for example  guidance relating to guaranteed issuance of coverage to children under age  coverage for preventive health services without cost sharing  lifetime and annual limits  rescissions and patient protections  rate review of unreasonable rates in the individual and small group markets and guidance on accountable care organizations  or acos but we are still awaiting further final guidance on a number of key provisions 
these provisions include essential health benefits  the calculation of the health insurer fee  and federal criteria for participation in state based exchanges among others 
the final aco rules are intended to create incentives for health care providers to work together to treat an individual across different care settings 
the impact of these new rules on the healthcare market and the role to be played by health plans in the operation of acos remains to be determined 
though the federal government has in certain instances issued final regulations  there remains considerable uncertainty around the ultimate requirements of the legislation  as the final regulations are sometimes unclear or incomplete  and are subject to further change 
the federal government has also issued additional forms of guidance that may not be consistent with the final regulations 
as a result  many of the impacts of health care reform will not be known for certain until the ultimate requirements of the legislation have been definitively determined 
various health insurance reform proposals are also emerging at the state level 
many of the states in which we operate are already implementing parts of the federal health care reform and many states have added new requirements that are more exacting than the federal health care reform requirements 
also  many states may continue to consider legislation to extend coverage to the uninsured through medicaid expansions  mandate minimum medical loss ratios  implement rate reforms and enact benefit mandates that go beyond essential benefits 
in addition  some states have passed legislation or are considering proposals to establish an insurance exchange within the state to comply with provisions of the health care reform legislation that become effective in for example  california passed legislation in establishing a state based insurance exchange and authorizing an oversight board to negotiate the price of plans sold on the insurance exchange 
these kinds of state regulations and legislations could increase the pressure on us to contain our premium prices and thereby could negatively impact our revenues and profitability 
this also could increase the competition we face from companies that have lower health care or administrative costs than we do and therefore can price their premiums at lower levels than we can 
california is the first state to adopt such a structure for a state based insurance exchange in response to the aca 
if other states in which we operate adopt a similar format for their exchanges  that could further increase the competition that we face and the pressure on us to contain our premiums 
at least some states and possibly the federal government may condition health carrier participation in an exchange on a number of factors  which could mean that some carriers would be excluded from participation 
even in cases where state action is limited to implementing federal reforms  new or amended state laws will be required in many cases 
states also may disagree in their interpretations of the federal statute and regulations  and state guidance that is issued could be unclear or untimely 
the interaction of new federal regulations and the implementation efforts of the various states in which we do business will create substantial uncertainty for us and other health insurance companies about the requirements under which we must operate 
adding to the uncertainty  there also have been congressional and legal challenges to federal health care reform that  if ultimately successful  could result in changes to the existing legislation or the repeal of aca in its entirety 
since its passage  a number of state governors have strenuously opposed certain of the aca s provisions  
table of contents and initiated lawsuits challenging its constitutionality 
these challenges are pending final adjudication in several jurisdictions  including the us supreme court 
congress has also proposed a number of legislative initiatives  including possible repeal of the aca 
in  the president signed legislation to eliminate billion of the billion in start up funding that the aca provided to support the launch of health insurance cooperatives  and congress may also withhold the funding necessary to implement the aca 
at this time  it remains unclear whether there will be any changes made to the aca  whether to certain provisions or its entirety 
if the individual mandate is struck down  but provisions relating to guaranteed issue are upheld  people with greater needs for health care services could make up a greater portion of our membership  which would have an adverse impact on our medical loss ratios  profitability and earnings 
these effects could be exacerbated if we are unable to obtain  or are delayed in obtaining  regulatory approval of adequate premium rates for the risk we assume 
due to the unsettled nature of these reforms and the numerous steps required to implement them  we cannot predict how future regulations and laws  including state laws  implementing the health care reform legislation will impact our business 
to date  the legislation has not had a material adverse impact on our business  financial results and results of operations 
however  in the future  depending in part on the ultimate requirements of the legislation  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
medicare legislation and regulation 
comprehensive legislation  specifically title xviii of the social security act of  as amended most recently by the aca  governs our medicare program 
in addition  our medicare contracts are subject to regulation by cms 
cms has the right to audit medicare contractors and the health care providers and administrative contractors who provide certain services on their behalf to determine the quality of care being rendered and the degree of compliance with cms contracts and regulations 
see medicare products for more information on our medicare business and see item a 
risk factors federal and state audits  reviews and investigations of us and our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial condition and cash flows for a description of the risks associated with our medicare business  including recent cms sanctions against us and the ongoing suspension of our auto enrollment and reassignment of lis beneficiaries 
medicaid and related legislation 
federal law has also implemented other health programs that are partially funded by the federal government  such as the medicaid program known as medi cal in california and chip known as the healthy families program in california 
our medi cal program is regulated and administered by the dhcs and the healthy families program is regulated by the managed risk medical insurance board 
federal funding remains critical to the viability of these programs  particularly in light of california s state budget deficits 
federal law permits the federal government to oversee and  in some cases  to enact  regulations and other requirements that must be followed by california with respect to these programs 
medicaid and chip are administered at the federal level by cms 
on october   cms approved certain elements of california s budget proposals to reduce medi cal provider reimbursement rates as authorized by california assembly bill ab 
the elements approved by cms include a percent reduction in a number of provider reimbursement rates 
the dhcs has preliminarily indicated that the medi cal managed care rate reductions could be effective retroactive to july  recently  the united states district court for the central district of california issued a series of injunctions barring the california department of health care services from implementing the rate reductions as to various classes of providers 
if ab is ultimately implemented as proposed  we believe that the approved reductions in provider payments would result in a premium reduction from the medi cal business conducted in our california health plan 
in addition  our ability to obtain health care cost recoveries from providers relating to any implemented rate cuts could affect the financial results of our california health plan 
however  due to the preliminary injunction in effect and other uncertainty regarding the final implementation of ab  we cannot reasonably estimate the range of reductions in premiums and or related health care cost recoveries that may result in connection with ab 
table of contents privacy regulations 
the use  disclosure and maintenance of individually identifiable health information and other data by our businesses is regulated by various laws at the federal  state and local level 
these laws and regulations are changed frequently by legislation or administrative interpretation 
most of those laws are derived from health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa and the privacy provisions in the federal gramm leach bliley financial modernization act of the gramm leach bliley act  although there are an increasing number of state laws that require notification to individuals and regulatory authorities in the event of a security breach and that specifically regulate the use and disclosure of social security numbers 
hipaa and the implementing regulations that have been adopted in connection therewith impose obligations for group health plans and issuers of health insurance coverage such as health insurers and health maintenance organizations relating to the privacy and security of protected health information including electronically transmitted protected health information collectively  phi 
the regulations  which relate to the privacy and security of phi  require health plans  health care clearinghouses and providers to comply with various requirements and restrictions related to the use  storage and disclosure of phi  adopt rigorous internal procedures to protect phi  create policies related to the privacy of phi  enter into specific written agreements with business associates to whom phi is disclosed  and notify individuals and regulatory authorities if phi is compromised 
the regulations also establish significant criminal penalties and civil sanctions for non compliance 
recent developments in this area include the health information technology for economic and clinical health hitech act  which became fully effective in february the hitech act expands the hipaa rules for security and privacy safeguards  including improved enforcement  additional limitations on use and disclosure of phi and additional potential penalties for non compliance 
see item a 
risk factors if we fail to comply with requirements relating to patient privacy and information security  including taking steps to ensure that our business associates who obtain access to sensitive patient information maintain the privacy and security of such information  our reputation and business operations could be materially adversely affected for additional information about the risks related to privacy and security breaches 
the gramm leach bliley act generally requires insurers to provide customers with notice regarding how their personal health and financial information is used and  in certain circumstances  the opportunity to opt out of certain disclosures before the insurer shares non public personal information with a non affiliated third party 
like hipaa  this law sets a floor standard  allowing states to adopt more stringent requirements governing privacy protection 
erisa 
most employee benefit plans are regulated by the federal government under the employee retirement income security act of  as amended erisa 
employment based health coverage is such an employee benefit plan 
erisa is administered  in large part  by the us department of labor 
erisa contains disclosure requirements for documents that define the benefits and coverage 
it also contains a provision that causes federal law to preempt state law in the regulation and governance of certain benefit plans and employer groups  including the availability of legal remedies under state law 
other federal regulations 
we must comply with  and are affected by  laws and regulations relating to the award  administration and performance of us government contracts 
government contract laws and regulations affect how we do business with our customers and  in some instances  impose added costs on our business 
in addition  because of our activities to support the mflc contract and certain outsourcing arrangements we have with third party vendors  we are also subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and similar worldwide anti corruption laws  including the uk bribery act of  which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non us officials for the purpose of obtaining or 
table of contents retaining business 
a violation of specific laws and regulations by us or our agents could result in  among other things  the imposition of fines and penalties on us  changes to our business practices  the termination of our contracts or debarment from bidding on contracts

for additional information about our northeast operations segment  see northeast operations segment 
insurance and hmo laws impose a number of financial requirements and restrictions on our regulated subsidiaries  which vary from state to state 
they generally include certain minimum capital and deposit and or reserve requirements  restrictions on dividends and other distributions to the parent corporations and affiliated corporations 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources statutory capital requirements 
these financial requirements are subject to change  which may require us to commit additional capital to certain regulated subsidiaries or may limit our ability to move capital through dividends and other distributions 
while there are state by state variations  hmo regulation generally is extremely comprehensive 
among the areas regulated by these hmo regulatory agencies are adequacy of financial resources  network of health care providers and administrative operations  sales and enrollment requirements  disclosure documents and notice requirements  product offerings  including the scope of mandatory benefits and required offerings of benefits that are optional coverages  
table of contents procedures for member grievance resolution and medical necessity determinations  accessibility of providers  handling of provider claims including out of network claims and adherence to timely and accurate payment and appeal rules  and linguistic and cultural accessibility standards  governance requirements and reporting requirements 
ppo regulation also varies by state  and while these regulations generally cover all or most of the subject areas referred to above  the regulation of ppo products and carriers tends to be less intensive than regulation of hmos 
variations in state regulation also arise in connection with the intensity of government oversight 
variations include the need to file or have affirmatively approved certain proposals before use or implementation by the health plan  the degree of review and comment by the regulatory agency  the amount and type of reporting by the health plan to the regulatory agency  the extent and frequency of audit or other examination  and the authority and extent of investigative activity  enforcement action  corrective action authority  and penalties and fines 
in addition  either the states or the federal government will create exchanges  which will act as markets for the purchase of subsidized health insurance 
at least some states and possibly the federal government may condition health carrier participation in an exchange on a number of factors  which could mean that some carriers would be excluded 
our regulated subsidiaries are also subject to legal restrictions on our ability to price some of our products 
some products may be subject to regulatory approval of premium levels 
generally  insurance and hmo laws require premiums to be established at amounts reasonably related to our costs 
state regulations also may be more stringent than federal regulations that are applicable to us 
for example  the california department of insurance recently adopted emergency regulations regarding medical loss ratios requiring individual products subject to its jurisdiction to meet or exceed an medical loss ratio in under the emergency regulations  the medical loss ratio must be included in all individual product filings and calculated as an estimate on a prospective basis for the following policy period 
however  under the federal regulations  the medical loss ratio is to be calculated on a retrospective basis that is  medical loss ratio results are required to be reported in june in addition  various health insurance reform proposals are emerging at the state level 
for addition information  see item a 
risk factors various health insurance reform proposals are also emerging at the state level which could have an adverse impact on us

federal health care reform legislation could have an adverse impact on our revenues and the costs of operating our business and could materially adversely affect our business  cash flows  financial condition and results of operations 
during the first quarter of  the president signed the aca into law  which is causing and will continue to cause significant changes to the us health care system and alter the dynamics of the health care insurance industry 
the provisions of the new legislation  among other things impose significant new taxes and fees on health insurers that may not be deductible for income tax purposes  including a health insurer fee on fully insured premiums and an excise tax on high premium insurance policies  stipulate a minimum medical loss ratio as adopted by the department of health and human services  limit medicare advantage payment rates  increase mandated benefits  eliminate medical underwriting for medical insurance coverage decisions  which is referred to as guaranteed issue  increase restrictions on rescinding coverage  or rescissions  prohibit some annual and all lifetime limits on amounts paid on behalf of or to members  limit the ability of health plans to vary premiums based on assessments of underlying risk  limit the amount of compensation paid to health insurance executives that is tax deductible  expand regulations that govern premium rate increase requests  require that individuals obtain coverage and 
table of contents require the creation of government controlled exchanges where individuals and small business groups may purchase health coverage 
for a further discussion regarding the aca and related legislation  see item government regulation federal legislation and regulations 
various aspects of the health care reform legislation could have an adverse impact on our revenues  enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments and the cost of operating our business 
among other things  the legislation will require premium rate review in certain market segments  and require premium rebates in the event minimum medical loss ratios are not met 
we do not believe that we will be required to pay a material amount in rebates with respect to our business  however  we cannot be certain that we will not be required to pay material amounts in rebates in the future 
in addition  the legislation will lower the rates of medicare payments we receive  may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain members  and will increase the amount of certain taxes and fees we pay  which is expected to increase our effective tax rate in future periods 
the new legislation will also impose a sales tax on medical device manufacturers and increase the amount of fees pharmaceutical manufacturers pay both of which in turn could increase our medical costs 
we could also face additional competition as competitors seize on opportunities to expand their business as a result of the new legislation  though there remains considerable uncertainty about the impact of these changes on the health insurance market as a whole and what actions our competitors could take 
see the markets in which we do business are highly competitive 
if we do not design and price our product offerings competitively  our membership and profitability could decline 
because of the magnitude  scope and complexity of the new legislation  we also need to dedicate substantial resources and incur material expenses to implement the new legislation  including implementing the current and future regulations that will provide guidance and clarification on important parts of the legislation 
any delay or failure by us to execute our operational and strategic initiatives with respect to health care reform or otherwise appropriately react to the legislation  implementing regulations and actions of our competitors could result in operational disruptions  disputes with our providers or members  regulatory issues  damage to our existing or potential member relationships or other adverse consequences 
there are numerous steps required to implement this legislation  with clarifying regulations and other guidance expected over several years 
additional guidance on certain provisions of the federal reform legislation has been issued 
however  we are still awaiting further final guidance on a number of key provisions  including regarding essential health benefits  the calculation of the health insurer fee  and federal criteria for participation in state based exchanges 
there remains considerable uncertainty around the ultimate requirements of the legislation  as the final regulations are sometimes unclear or incomplete  and are subject to further change 
the federal government has also issued additional forms of guidance that may not be consistent with the final regulations 
as a result  many of the impacts of health care reform will not be known for certain until the ultimate requirements of the legislation have been definitively determined 
adding to the uncertainty  there also have been congressional and legal challenges to federal health care reform that  if ultimately successful  could result in changes to the existing legislation or the repeal of aca in its entirety 
since its passage  a number of state governors have strenuously opposed certain of the aca s provisions  and initiated lawsuits challenging its constitutionality 
these challenges are pending final adjudication in several jurisdictions  including the us supreme court 
congress has also proposed a number of legislative initiatives  including possible repeal of the aca 
in  the president signed legislation to eliminate billion of the billion in start up funding that the aca provided to support the launch of health insurance cooperatives  and congress may also withhold the funding necessary to implement the aca 
at this time  it remains unclear whether there will be any changes made to the aca  whether to certain provisions or its entirety 
if the individual mandate is removed from the aca  but provisions relating to guaranteed issue are implemented  people with greater needs for health care services could make up a greater portion of our membership  which would have an adverse impact on our medical loss ratios  profitability and earnings 
these effects could be exacerbated if we are unable to obtain  or are delayed in obtaining  regulatory approval of adequate premium rates for the risk we assume 

table of contents due to the unsettled nature of these reforms and the numerous steps required to implement them  we cannot predict how future regulations and laws  including state laws  implementing the health care reform legislation will impact our business 
depending in part on the ultimate requirements of the legislation  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
various health insurance reform proposals are also emerging at the state level which could have an adverse impact on us 
in addition to the federal health care reform legislation  various health insurance reform proposals are also emerging at the state level 
many of the states in which we operate are already implementing parts of the federal health care reform and many states have added new requirements that are more exacting than the federal health care reform requirements 
also  many states may continue to consider legislation to extend coverage to the uninsured through medicaid expansions  mandate minimum medical loss ratios  implement rate reforms and enact benefit mandates that go beyond essential benefits 
in addition  some states have passed legislation or are considering proposals to establish an insurance exchange within the state to comply with provisions of the health care reform legislation that become effective in for example  california passed legislation in establishing a state based insurance exchange and authorizing an oversight board to negotiate the price of plans sold on the insurance exchange 
these kinds of state regulations and legislations could increase the pressure on us to contain our premium prices and thereby could negatively impact our revenues and profitability 
this also could increase the competition we face from companies that have lower health care or administrative costs than we do and therefore can price their premiums at lower levels than we can 
see we face competitive pressure to contain premium prices 
california is the first state to adopt such a structure for a state based insurance exchange in response to the aca 
if other states in which we operate adopt a similar format for their exchanges  that could further increase the competition that we face and the pressure on us to contain our premiums 
at least some states and possibly the federal government may condition health carrier participation in an exchange on a number of factors  which could mean that some carriers would be excluded from participation 
even in cases where state action is limited to implementing federal reforms  new or amended state laws will be required in many cases 
states also may disagree in their interpretations of the federal statute and regulations  and state guidance that is issued could be unclear or untimely 
the interaction of new federal regulations and the implementation efforts of the various states in which we do business will create substantial uncertainty for us and other health insurance companies about the requirements under which we must operate 
state regulators are also considering new requirements that would restrict our ability to implement changes to our premium rates 
for example  in california  an initiative is circulating that  if qualified and enacted  would impose significant prior approval requirements for rate changes for individual and small groups 
these changes could  among other things  lower the amount of premium increases we receive or extend the amount of time that it takes for us to obtain regulatory approval to implement increases in our premium rates  and we have begun to experience greater scrutiny by regulators of proposed increases to our premium rates 
health insurance reform proposals at the state level  or other initiatives undertaken by state regulators  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our profitability will depend  in part  on our ability to accurately predict and control health care costs 
a substantial majority of the revenue we receive is used to pay the costs of health care services and supplies delivered to our members 
many of these costs  including costs associated with physician and hospital care  new medical technology and prescription drugs  for example  are rising 
the total amount of health care costs we incur is affected by the number and type of individual services we provide and the cost of each service 
our future profitability will depend  in part  on our ability to accurately predict health care costs and to manage future health care utilization and costs through underwriting criteria  utilization management  product design and negotiation of favorable professional and hospital contracts 
periodic renegotiations of hospital and other provider contracts  coupled with continued consolidation of physician  hospital and other provider groups  may 
table of contents result in increased health care costs or limit our ability to negotiate favorable rates 
government imposed limitations on medicare and medicaid reimbursement have also caused  and are expected to continue to cause  the private sector to bear a greater share of increasing health care costs 
additionally  there is always the possibility that adverse risk selection could occur when members who utilize higher levels of health care services compared with the insured population as a whole choose to remain with our health plans rather than risk moving to another plan 
this could cause our health care costs to be higher than anticipated and therefore cause our financial results to fall short of expectations 
changes in utilization rates  demographic characteristics  the regulatory environment  including  for example  the implementation of the aca or other state or federal laws and their impact on our health care costs and our ability to change our premium rates  health care practices  inflation  new technologies  clusters of high cost cases  continued consolidation of physician  hospital and other provider groups and numerous other factors may adversely affect our ability to predict and control health care costs and  as a result  our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
for additional detail on the impact on health care costs resulting from federal health care reform and potential additional changes in federal and state legislation and regulations  see federal health care reform legislation could have an adverse impact on our revenues and the costs of operating our business and could materially adversely affect our business  cash flows  financial condition and results of operations  various health insurance reform proposals are also emerging at the state level which could have an adverse impact on us and a significant reduction in revenues from the government programs in which we participate could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
a significant category of our health care costs is the cost of hospital based products and services 
factors underlying the increase in hospital costs include  but are not limited to  the underfunding of public programs  such as medicaid and medicare and the constant pressure that places on rates from commercial health plans  growing rates of uninsured individuals  new technology  state initiated mandates  alleged abuse of hospital chargemasters  an aging population  changes in the economic environment and  under certain circumstances  relatively low levels of hospital competition caused by market concentration 
another significant category of our health care costs is costs of pharmaceutical products and services 
factors affecting our pharmaceutical costs include  but are not limited to  the price of drugs  utilization of new and existing drugs  changes in discounts and the impact of health care reform on pharmaceutical manufacturers through such requirements as increased fees 
in addition  a large scale public health epidemic and or terrorist activity could affect our ability to control health care costs 
see large scale public health epidemics and or terrorist activity could cause us to incur unexpected health care and other costs and could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as a measure of the impact of medical costs on our financial results  relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results 
for example  if medical costs increased by without a proportional change in related revenues for our health plan products  our annual pre tax income for would have been reduced by approximately million 
the inability to accurately forecast and manage our health care costs in all circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we face competitive pressure to contain premium prices 
in addition to the challenge of controlling health care costs  we face competitive pressure to contain premium prices 
while health plans compete on the basis of many factors  including service and the quality and depth of provider networks  price has been and will continue to be a significant basis of competition 
any future increase in premiums could result in the loss of members  particularly in light of continued economic pressures 
our premiums are set in advance of the actual delivery of services  and  in certain circumstances  before contracting with providers 
while we attempt to take into account our estimate of expected health care costs over the premium period in setting the premiums we charge or bid  factors such as competition  new or changed regulations and other circumstances may limit our ability to fully base premiums on estimated costs 
in addition  the aca imposes an annual fee on health insurers for each calendar year beginning on or after january 
table of contents and we may not be able to cover these costs by increasing our premium rates 
certain non profits will not be subject to this fee and  as a result  may have a competitive advantage over other health insurers  including us  that will subject to this fee 
in addition  many factors may  and often do  cause actual health care costs to exceed those costs estimated and reflected in premiums or bids 
these factors may include increased utilization of services  increased cost of individual services  catastrophes  epidemics  unanticipated seasonality  insured population characteristics  new mandated benefits or other regulatory changes  including those included in the aca or other state or federal laws 
if we are unable to accurately estimate costs and set our premiums accordingly  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  our ability to increase our premiums may be restricted by law 
for example  the aca requires the establishment of a process for review of unreasonable premium rate increases 
in addition  the federal government and some states where we do business have required prior regulatory approval of premium rate increases and or have subjected such increases to heightened scrutiny  such as third party review 
for example  the california department of insurance requires a third party actuarial review of health insurance carriers proposed premium rate increases to confirm compliance with applicable law  resulting in a delay in carriers ability to implement rate increases 
on may   hhs issued a final rule providing that hhs will perform rate reviews for states that are determined by hhs not to have an effective review process in place for proposed premium rate increases 
arizona is one of the states determined by hhs not to have effective review processes currently in place 
further  in california  proponents of rate review have begun to circulate an initiative measure for signature that would  if qualified for the ballot and enacted  impose significant additional requirements on health plans relating to premium increases 
these requirements and proposed changes have in the past and could in the future  among other things  lower the amount of premium increases we receive or extend the amount of time that it takes for us to obtain regulatory approval to implement increases in our premium rates 
in certain of our competitors were asked by the commissioner of the california department of insurance to voluntarily delay implementation of scheduled premium increases to permit additional review by the california department of insurance  which review led the carriers to reduce proposed rate increases 
we have experienced  and are likely to continue to experience  greater scrutiny by regulators of proposed increases to our premium rates 
for additional detail on the impact of federal health care reform and potential additional changes in federal and state legislation and regulations on our ability to maintain or increase premium levels  see federal health care reform legislation could have an adverse impact on our revenues and the costs of operating our business and could materially adversely affect our business  cash flows  financial condition and results of operations and various health insurance reform proposals are also emerging at the state level which could have an adverse impact on us 
our financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected by significant disparities between the premium increases of our health plans and those of our major competitors or by limitations on our ability to increase or maintain our premium levels 
in  we saw slight decreases in our total commercial membership primarily resulting from the shrinking commercial population due to continued high unemployment and strained economic conditions which have caused purchasers and individuals to discontinue coverage or seek lower cost options 
our tailored network plans provide lower cost options to our members and employer groups  and the continued membership growth in our tailored network products and the continued development of innovative provider relationships are an important part of our business strategy 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement these strategic initiatives that are intended to position us for health care reform and future profitable growth  that the products we design in collaboration with certain providers will be successful or developed within the time periods expected  or that the products that we offer will be preferable to similar products of our competitors 
failure to successfully implement this strategy may have an adverse impact on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
the aca and other federal and state legislation and regulations constrain the medical loss ratios maintained by managed health care companies such as us 
the aca requires premium rebates to the extent that minimum medical loss ratios are not met 
we do not believe that we will be required to pay a material amount in rebates with respect to our business  however  we cannot be certain that we will not be required to pay material 
table of contents amounts in rebates in the future 
in the various states in which we do business  premium prices are also constrained by state laws and regulations which restrict the spread between premiums and benefits  such as laws and regulations that require a minimum loss ratio of a certain percentage 
these laws and regulations not only restrict our ability to raise our premiums but also create additional competitive pressure from some of our competitors who may have lower health care costs than we have and therefore price their premiums at relatively low levels in relation to our cost of care 
these laws and regulations also have generated  and could continue to generate  substantial media attention and strong public opinion 
this may create a more conservative regulatory environment  thereby either delaying any rate increases that we propose or further restraining our ability to price at levels that can adequately cover our cost and margin goals 
see federal health care reform legislation could have an adverse impact on our revenues and the costs of operating our business and could materially adversely affect our business  cash flows  financial condition and results of operations and various health insurance reform proposals are also emerging at the state level which could have an adverse impact on us 
our business is regionally concentrated in the states of california  arizona and oregon 
our business operations are primarily concentrated in the states of california  arizona and oregon  and all of our medicaid operations are in the state of california 
due to this concentration in a small number of states  in particular  california  we are exposed to the risk of a deterioration in our financial results if our health plans in these states  in particular  california  experience significant losses 
in addition  our financial results could be adversely affected by economic conditions in these states 
if the challenging economic conditions in the state of california or in the other states in which we operate do not materially improve or deteriorate further  we may experience reductions in existing and new business  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  if reimbursement payments from a state are significantly delayed  our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 
for example  due to budget issues  the state of california delayed certain of its monthly medicaid payments to us 
although the state ultimately made these payments  the delays impacted our operating cash flow from quarter to quarter in the irregular timing of these payments could continue into future periods and  depending on the timing of such payments  impact cash flow in future periods 
our inability to estimate and maintain appropriate levels of reserves for claims may adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our reserves for claims are estimates of incurred costs based on various assumptions 
the accuracy of these estimates may be affected by external forces such as changes in the rate of inflation  the regulatory environment  the judicious administration of claims  medical costs and other factors 
included in the reserves for claims are estimates for the costs of services that have been incurred but not reported and for claims received but not processed 
these estimates are continually monitored and reviewed and  as settlements are made or estimates adjusted  differences are reflected in current operations 
given the uncertainties inherent in such estimates  the actual liability could differ significantly from the amounts reserved 
if our actual liability is lower than estimated  it could mean that we set premium prices too high  which could result in a loss of membership 
if our actual liability for claims payments is higher than estimated  it could have a negative impact on our profitability per enrolled member and  subsequently  our earnings per share in any particular quarter or annual period 
our businesses are subject to laws and significant rules and regulations  which increases our cost of doing business and could impact our financial performance by restricting our ability to conduct business or adversely affecting our ability to grow our businesses 
our businesses are subject to extensive federal and state laws  rules  and regulations  including  but not limited to  financial requirements  licensing requirements  enrollment requirements and periodic examinations by governmental agencies 
our hmo and insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulations relating to cash reserves  minimum net worth  premium rates  approval of policy language and benefits  appeals and grievances with respect to benefit determinations  provider contracting  utilization management  issuance and termination of 
table of contents policies  claims payment practices and a wide variety of other regulations relating to the development and operation of health plans 
these laws  rules  and regulations are generally intended to benefit and protect providers and health plan members rather than stockholders of managed health care companies such as health net 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to obtain or maintain required governmental approvals or licenses 
the laws  rules  and regulations governing our business and interpretations of those laws  rules  and regulations are subject to frequent change  and there is no guarantee that legislative or regulatory changes will not have a material adverse effect on us 
broad latitude is given to the agencies administering these laws  rules  and regulations to interpret them and to impose substantial fines or restrict our ability to do business when they believe violations or failures to meet standards or requirements have occurred 
regulatory agencies  such as the california department of managed health care  the california department of health care services  cms  the us department of health human services office of civil rights and state departments of insurance  have the authority to impose substantial fines and or penalties against us and restrict our business activities 
certain of these agencies have done so in the past  and may impose substantial fines and or penalties against us and restrict our business activities in the future if they determine that we have not complied with applicable laws  rules  and regulations 
further  such fines  penalties and restrictions may be more severe in circumstances in which regulatory agencies determine that we have repeatedly failed to comply with applicable laws  rules or regulations 
see federal and state audits  reviews and investigations of us and our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial condition and cash flows for information regarding sanctions imposed by cms against us 
as we have members in various states and are therefore subject to the regulatory oversight of multiple jurisdictions  we have been in the past  and could be in the future  subject to fines and or penalties imposed by multiple regulatory agencies relating to the same incident 
existing or future laws  rules  and regulations could  among other things  force us to change how we do business and may restrict our revenue and or enrollment growth  increase our health care and administrative costs  and or increase our exposure to liability with respect to members  providers or others 
see federal health care reform legislation could have an adverse impact on our revenues and the costs of operating our business and could materially adversely affect our business  cash flows  financial condition and results of operations  various health insurance reform proposals are also emerging at the state level which could have an adverse impact on us and a significant reduction in revenues from the government programs in which we participate could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
further  individual health net associates may violate these laws  rules  and regulations  notwithstanding our internal policies and compliance programs 
for example  see if we fail to comply with requirements relating to patient privacy and information security  including taking steps to ensure that our business associates who obtain access to sensitive patient information maintain the privacy and security of such information  our reputation and business operations could be materially adversely affected 
as a federal and state government contractor  we are subject to us and state government oversight 
the government may investigate our business practices and audit our compliance with applicable rules and regulations 
depending on the results of those audits and investigations  the government could make claims against us 
under government procurement regulations and practices  a negative determination resulting from such claims could result in a contractor being fined  debarred and or suspended from being able to bid on  or be awarded  new government contracts for a period of time 
in addition  we are subject to state and federal false claims laws that generally prohibit the submission of false claims for reimbursement or payment to government agencies 
we are also subject to the foreign corrupt practices act and similar worldwide anti corruption laws  including the uk bribery act of  which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non us officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business 
courts have imposed substantial fines and penalties against companies found to have violated these laws 
we are also exposed to other risks associated with us and state government contracting  including but not limited to dependence upon congressional or legislative appropriation and allotment of funds  the impact that delays in government payments could impact our operating cash flow  and the general ability of the us government to terminate contracts with it  in whole or in part  without prior notice  for convenience or for default based on performance 
in addition  delays in obtaining  or failure to obtain or maintain  governmental approvals  or moratoria imposed by regulatory authorities  could adversely affect our revenue or membership  increase costs or adversely affect our ability to bring new products to market as forecasted

on august   cms lifted the sanctions  and we resumed marketing our medicare advantage  mapd and stand alone pdp products and enrolling beneficiaries with effective dates on or after september  see federal and state audits  reviews and investigations of us and our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial condition and cash flows for more information about the cms sanctions 
if we fail to design and maintain programs that are attractive to medicare participants  if we are sanctioned again  if we are not successful in winning contract renewals or new contracts  or if our existing contracts are terminated  our current medicare business and our ability to expand our medicare operations could be materially and adversely affected  negatively impacting our financial performance 
there are also specific additional risks associated with our provision of medicare part d prescription drug benefits under title xviii  part d of the social security act 
these risks include potential uncollectibility of receivables  inadequacy of pricing assumptions  inability to receive and process information and increased pharmaceutical costs  as well as the underlying seasonality of this business  and extended settlement periods for claims submissions 
in addition  our failure to comply with part d program requirements can result in financial and or operational sanctions on our part d products  as well as on our medicare advantage products that offer no prescription drug coverage 
for example  the cms sanctions imposed on us in november were primarily related to our noncompliance with part d program requirements  and applied to our medicare advantage plans that offer no prescription drug coverage  as well as to our medicare advantage and pdp only plans that offer prescription drug coverage 
on january   hnl entered into a definitive agreement to sell its medicare stand alone pdp business to a subsidiary of cvs caremark 
following the closing of this transaction  we will continue to provide medicare part d prescription drug benefits as part of our medicare advantage plan offerings 
see item segment information western region operations segment medicare products and acquisitions  divestitures and other significant transactions may adversely affect our business for more information on our agreement to sell our medicare stand alone pdp business 
in connection with our participation in the medicare advantage and part d programs  we regularly record revenues associated with the risk adjustment reimbursement mechanism employed by cms 
this mechanism is designed to appropriately reimburse health plans for the relative health care cost risk of its medicare enrollees 
under the cms risk adjustment methodology  all medicare advantage plans must collect and submit diagnosis code data from hospitals and physician providers to cms by specified deadlines 
cms uses this diagnosis information to calculate the risk adjusted premium paid to medicare advantage plans throughout the year 
for any given year  the final settlement of these risk adjustment payments is generally made in the second or third quarter of the following year 
because the recorded revenue associated with the risk adjustment reimbursement mechanism is based on our best estimate at the time  the actual payment we receive from cms for risk adjustment reimbursement settlements may be significantly greater or less than the amounts we initially recognize on our financial statements 
see federal and state audits  reviews and investigations of us and our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial condition and cash flows for information on our recent cms audits and potential audits of the provider medical data supporting the risk adjustment payments that we receive for our medicare members 

table of contents a significant reduction in revenues from the government programs in which we participate could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
approximately of our total revenues relate to federal  state and local government health care coverage programs  such as medicare  medicaid  tricare and mflc 
nearly all of the revenues in our government contracts segment come from the federal government  either directly or as a sub contractor for a federal government contract 
our contracts with the government are generally subject to a competitive bid process and government discretion  and if we fail to design and maintain programs attractive to our government customers  if we are not successful in winning new contracts or contract renewals  or if our existing contracts are terminated  our current government health care coverage programs business and our ability to expand this business could be materially and adversely affected 
see item segment information western region operations segment medicaid and related products for more information regarding certain of our opportunities to expand our business with government customers 
under government funded health programs  the government payor typically determines premium and reimbursement levels 
if the government payor reduces premium or reimbursement levels  such as medicare advantage payment rates as provided in the aca  or increases them by less than our costs increase  and we are unable to make offsetting adjustments through supplemental premiums and changes in benefit plans  we could be adversely affected 
the amount of government receivables set forth in our consolidated financial statements represents our best estimate of the government s liability to us under tricare  mflc and other government contracts  or amounts due us as a sub contractor 
in general  government receivables are estimates and subject to government audit and negotiation 
in addition  inherent in government contracts are an uncertainty of and vulnerability to disagreements with the government 
final amounts we ultimately receive under government contracts may be significantly greater or less than the amounts we initially recognize on our financial statements 
contracts under our government programs are generally subject to frequent change  including but not limited to changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible  reduce the revenue received by us or increase our administrative or health care costs  as applicable  under such programs 
such changes are more likely during re competition of government contracts 
for example  in connection with the pending mflc re competition  the government may elect to award a contract that covers only a portion of the current contract scope 
depending on the scope or terms of the contract actually awarded to us  if any  our revenue and profitability could be adversely affected 
accordingly  these and other changes to contracts for our government programs could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
for additional information on our mflc contract and the pending re competition of this contract see item segment information government contracts segment other department of defense contracts 
changes to government health care coverage programs in the future may also affect our willingness to participate in these programs 
our medicaid operations are solely in the state of california 
california continues to experience unprecedented budget deficits 
in response to the deficits  the state of california enacted proposed spending cuts for services as part of the budget  some of which could result in reductions in enrollment in or reimbursement from the medi cal and healthy families programs 
prior medi cal provider and health plan rate reimbursement reductions are the subject of pending litigation and certain of the cuts proposed as a part of the budget are also currently subject to litigation and or review by cms 
if the state of california prevails and the reimbursement cuts are implemented as currently proposed  the payments that we receive in connection with our state health programs business would be reduced 
an enrollment freeze or significant reduction in payments received in connection with these or similar programs could adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations  particularly as our medi cal membership increases 
in addition  california could impose requirements on the medi cal program that make our continued operations not feasible and could be unable to fund programs authorized by federal health care reform 
on april   we began delivering administrative services under the t contract for the tricare north region 
the t contract has five one year option periods  however  the department of defense exercised 
table of contents option period without exercising option period  due to a delay of approximately one year in the government s initial award of the t contract 
accordingly  option period commenced on april   and if all remaining option periods are exercised  the t contract would conclude on march  there can be no assurance that the department of defense will exercise all of the remaining option periods under the contract 
if all of the option periods are not exercised  our results of operations could be adversely impacted 
for additional information on our tricare operations  see item segment information government contracts segment tricare 
in addition  the reimbursement rates we receive from federal and state governments relating to our government health care coverage programs are subject to risk 
for example  on october   cms approved certain elements of california s budget proposals to reduce medi cal provider reimbursement rates as authorized by california assembly bill ab 
the elements approved by cms include a percent reduction in a number of provider reimbursement rates 
the california department of health care services has preliminarily indicated that the medi cal managed care rate reductions could be effective retroactive to july  recently  the united states district court for the central district of california issued a series of injunctions barring the california department of health care services from implementing the rate reductions as to various classes of providers 
if ab is ultimately implemented as proposed  we believe that the approved reductions in provider payments would result in a premium reduction from the medi cal business conducted in our california health plan 
in addition  our ability to obtain health care cost recoveries from providers relating to any implemented rate cuts could affect the financial results of our california health plan 
however  due to the preliminary injunction in effect and other uncertainty regarding the final implementation of ab  we cannot reasonably estimate the range of reductions in premiums and or related health care cost recoveries that may result in connection with ab furthermore  on august   the budget control act of was enacted in order to increase the federal government s debt limit and reduce the federal deficit 
the budget control act establishes a twelve member joint committee of congress known as the joint select committee on deficit reduction the joint select committee 
the joint select committee was tasked with proposing legislation to reduce the united states federal deficit by trillion for fiscal years by december  the joint select committee did not pass such legislation by the proposed deadline 
as a result  approximately trillion in domestic and defense spending reductions will automatically begin on january  and will be split evenly between domestic and defense spending 
medicare will be subject to these automatic spending reductions  subject to a cap 
all parts of the medicare program  including medicare advantage  could be subject to cuts  but it is unclear how they would be applied 
if medicare reimbursement rates from the federal government are cut  it could have an adverse impact on our medicare business 
for additional information on the risks associated with our medicare program  see medicare programs represent a significant portion of our business and are subject to risk 
federal and state audits  reviews and investigations of us and our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial condition and cash flows 
we have been and  in some cases  currently are  involved in various federal and state governmental audits  reviews and investigations 
these include routine  regular and special investigations  audits and reviews by government agencies  state insurance and health and welfare departments and others pertaining to financial performance  market conduct and regulatory compliance issues 
such audits  reviews and investigations could result in the loss of licensure or the right to participate or enroll members in certain programs  or the imposition of civil or criminal fines  penalties and other sanctions  which could be substantial 
in addition  disclosure of any adverse investigation or audit results or sanctions could negatively affect our reputation in various markets and make it more difficult or impossible for us to sell our products and services 
state attorneys general have become increasingly active in investigating the activities of health plans  and we have received in the past  and may continue to receive in the future  subpoenas and other requests for information as part of these investigations 
we 
table of contents have entered into consent agreements relating to  and in some instances have agreed to pay fines in connection with  several recent audits and investigations 
many regulatory audits  reviews and investigations in recent years have focused on the timeliness and accuracy of claims payments by managed care companies and health insurers 
our subsidiaries have been the subject of audits  reviews and investigations of this nature 
depending on the circumstances and the specific matters reviewed  regulatory findings could require remediation of any claims payment errors and payment of penalties of material amounts that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
from time to time  cms audits certain medicare advantage plans  including ours  to validate the coding practices and the supporting documentation maintained by health care providers to support risk adjustment payments made to plans pursuant to their medicare advantage contracts 
we utilize claims submissions  medical records and other medical data as provided by health care providers as the basis for payment requests that we submit to cms under the risk adjustment model for our medicare advantage contracts 
cms may conduct risk adjustment data validation radv contract level audits for payment years or later 
on february   cms published its final payment error calculation methodology for such radv audits 
while the methodology is complex  generally  cms will use enrollee level samples to estimate an error rate across the contract 
in the event of such an audit  cms may require payment from health net based on any error estimate 
any such risk adjustment payment adjustments could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
the laws and regulations governing the audits for these risk adjustment payments are extremely complex and subject to interpretation 
as a result  it is possible that our recorded revenue estimates with respect to risk adjustment payments may change by a material amount 
for additional detail on the risk adjustment reimbursement mechanism employed by cms and risks associated with our medicare business  see medicare programs represent a significant portion of our business and are subject to risk 
in january  we were notified by cms that  due to certain pharmacy claims processing errors  none of our stand alone pdp plans would receive auto assignment of lis eligible medicare beneficiaries under cms lis auto assignment process  effective february  on september   cms notified us that they would not reassign any lis beneficiaries to us for the plan year 
on august   cms notified us that our stand alone pdp plans will continue to be excluded from the pdps into which cms carries out daily auto enrollments or annual reassignment of lis eligible beneficiaries until at least march  and that this prohibition will remain in place until cms verifies that we are appropriately administering the lis benefit to current enrollees 
at this time  we do not expect the continued suspension of our auto enrollment for lis beneficiaries or cms lis beneficiary reassignment decision to have a material adverse effect on our medicare business 
in august  cms conducted a targeted audit of our medicare advantage  mapd and stand alone pdp plan operations  including the areas of membership accounting  premium billing  part d formulary administration  part d appeals  grievances and coverage determinations  and our compliance program 
based on the results of the audit  effective november  cms imposed sanctions against us suspending the marketing to and enrollment of new members into all of our medicare advantage  mapd and stand alone pdp products 
on august   cms lifted the sanctions  and we resumed marketing our medicare advantage  mapd and stand alone pdp products and enrolling beneficiaries with effective dates on or after september  in connection with the lifting of these sanctions  cms stated that it will closely monitor our medicare operations and that we will be subject to targeted monitoring and heightened surveillance and oversight 
these sanctions did not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  cash flows and liquidity in  however  any future sanctions against our medicare operations could have a material adverse impact on our medicare business and could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition 
any future sanctions imposed by cms may be more severe as a result of our past performance  particularly in circumstances in which cms determines that we have repeatedly failed to comply with applicable laws  rules or regulations 
if cms were to impose financial penalties and or additional sanctions on us  or terminate our existing medicare contracts  this could have a material adverse effect on us

table of contents we contract with independent third party vendors and service providers who provide services to us and our subsidiaries or to whom we delegate selected functions 
violations of  or noncompliance with  laws and or regulations governing our business by such third parties  or governing our dealings with such parties  could subject us to additional audits  reviews and investigations and adverse effects from such audits  reviews and investigations 
in addition  from time to time  government agencies investigate whether our operations are being conducted in accordance with regulations applicable to government contractors  including but not limited to regular audits to enforce mandatory pricing arrangements 
government investigations of us  whether relating to government contracts or conducted for other reasons  could result in administrative  civil or criminal liabilities  including repayments  fines and or penalties being imposed upon us  or could lead to suspension or debarment from future government contracting  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we face risks related to litigation  which  if resolved unfavorably  could result in substantial penalties and or monetary damages  including punitive damages 
in addition  we incur material expenses in the defense of litigation and our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and or liquidity could be adversely affected if litigation expenses are greater than we project 
we are currently  and may become in the future  subject to a variety of legal actions  including but not limited to employment and employment discrimination related suits  employee benefit claims  wage and hour claims  breach of contract actions  tort claims  fraud and misrepresentation claims  shareholder suits  including suits for securities fraud  intellectual property and real estate related disputes  and claims arising from or in connection with acquisitions  divestitures and other significant transactions  including but not limited to actions to block or unwind such transactions 
in addition  we incur and likely will continue to incur potential liability for claims related to the insurance industry in general and our business in particular  such as claims by members alleging failure to pay for or provide health care  poor outcomes for care delivered or arranged  improper rescission  termination or non renewal of coverage  and insufficient payments for out of network services  claims by employer groups for return of premiums  claims by providers  including claims for withheld or otherwise insufficient compensation or reimbursement  claims related to self funded business and claims related to reinsurance matters  and claims alleging information security incidents and breaches 
for example  we currently are party to various putative class action lawsuits filed in federal and state courts in connection with our announcement that certain server drives containing protected health information or personally identifying information of certain individuals are unaccounted for in connection with the migration of our data center to a facility owned and operated by a third party vendor 
these actions assert a variety of legal claims  including claims under the california confidentiality of medical information act  and seek damages under that statute as well as other compensatory damages  restitution  injunctive relief and attorneys fees 
see part i item legal proceedings and if we fail to comply with requirements relating to patient privacy and information security  including taking steps to ensure that our business associates who obtain access to sensitive patient information maintain the privacy and security of such information  our reputation and business operations could be materially adversely affected for additional information 
the legal actions to which we are currently and in the future could be subject can also include allegations of fraud  misrepresentation  unfair or improper business practices and violations of state or federal antitrust laws and can include claims for punitive damages and various forms of injunctive relief 
also  there are currently  and may be in the future  attempts to bring class action lawsuits against various managed care organizations  including us 
in some of the cases pending against us  substantial non economic or punitive damages are also being sought 
we cannot predict the outcome of any lawsuit with certainty  and we are incurring material expenses in the defense of litigation matters  including without limitation  substantial discovery costs 
recent court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of the types of claims we face 
there is a risk that we could incur substantial legal fees and expenses  including discovery expenses  in any of the actions we defend in excess of any amounts budgeted for defense 
plaintiffs attorneys have increasingly used expansive electronic discovery requests as a litigation tactic 
responding to these requests  the scope of which may exceed the normal capacity of our historical systems for archiving and organizing electronic documents  may require application of 
table of contents significant resources and impose significant costs on us 
in certain cases  we could also be subject to awards of substantial legal fees and costs to plaintiffs counsel 
while we currently have insurance policies that may provide coverage for some of the potential liabilities relating to litigation matters  there can be no assurance that coverage will be available for any particular case or liability 
insurers could dispute coverage or the amount of insurance may not be sufficient to cover the damages awarded or settlement amounts 
in addition  certain liabilities  such as punitive damages  may not be covered by insurance 
insurance coverage for all or certain types of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future or the deductible on any such insurance coverage could be set at a level that would result in us effectively self insuring cases against us 
the deductible on our errors and omissions e o insurance has reached such a level 
given the amount of the deductible  the only cases which would be covered by our e o insurance are those involving claims that substantially exceed our average claim values and otherwise qualify for coverage under the terms of the insurance policy 
we regularly evaluate litigation matters pending against us  including those described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report  to determine if settlement of such matters would be in the best interests of the company and its stockholders 
we record reserves and accrue costs for certain significant legal proceedings which represent our best estimate of the probable loss  including related future legal costs  for such matters  both known and unknown 
however  our recorded amounts might differ materially from the ultimate amount of any such costs 
the costs associated with any settlement of or judgment relating to the various legal proceedings to which we are or may be subject from time to time  such as the proceedings described in note  could be substantial and  in certain cases  could result in a significant earnings charge or impact on our cash flow in any particular quarter 
for example  as a result of the louisiana supreme court s decision in the amcareco litigation  we recorded a pretax charge of million in the year ended december  the costs associated with any settlement of or judgment relating to the various legal proceedings to which we are or may be subject from time to time  such as the proceedings described in note  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and or liquidity 
we are subject to risks associated with outsourcing services and functions to third parties 
we currently contract with independent third party vendors and service providers who provide services to us and our subsidiaries or to whom we delegate selected functions 
these third parties provide a material amount of services to us  and include  but are not limited to  information technology infrastructure and applications solutions providers  medical management providers  claims administration providers  billing and enrollment providers  third party providers of actuarial services  call center providers and specialty service providers 
we are continuing to explore further opportunities to outsource certain other business process functions  including in the area of information technology 
our current and any future arrangements with third party vendors and service providers may make our operations vulnerable if those third parties fail to satisfy their obligations to us  including their obligations to maintain and protect the security and confidentiality of our information and data 
in addition  we may have disagreements with third party vendors and service providers regarding relative responsibilities for any such failures under applicable business associate agreements or other applicable outsourcing agreements 
any contractual remedies and or indemnification obligations we may have for vendor or service provider failures may not be adequate to fully compensate us for any losses suffered as a result of any vendor s failure to satisfy their obligations to us or under applicable law 
our current and any future outsourcing arrangements could be adversely impacted by changes in vendor s or service provider s operations or financial condition or other matters outside of our control 
if we fail to adequately monitor and regulate the performance of our third party vendors and service providers  we could be subject to additional risk 
if these vendor and service provider relationships were terminated for any reason  we may not be able to find alternative partners in a timely manner or on acceptable financial terms  and may incur significant costs and or disruption to our operations in connection with any such vendor or service provider transition 
as a result  we may not be able to meet the full demands of our customers and  in turn  our business  financial condition and results of operations may be harmed 
in addition  we may not fully realize the anticipated economic and other benefits from our outsourcing 
table of contents projects or other relationships we enter into with third party vendors and service providers  as a result of regulatory restrictions on outsourcing  unanticipated delays in transitioning our operations to the third party  vendor or service provider noncompliance with contract terms or violations of laws and or regulations  or otherwise 
this could result in substantial costs or other operational or financial problems that could adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
violations of  or noncompliance with  laws and or regulations governing our business or noncompliance with contract terms by third party vendors and service providers could increase our exposure to liability to our members  providers or other third parties  or sanctions and or fines from the regulators that oversee our business 
in turn  this could increase the costs associated with the operation of our business or have an adverse impact on our business and reputation 
in addition  we currently outsource and may in the future outsource key services and functions to third parties  including us companies doing business in foreign jurisdictions  which exposes us to risks inherent in conducting business outside of the united states  including international economic and political conditions  and additional costs associated with complying with foreign laws and us laws applicable to operations in foreign jurisdictions  such as the foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act of if we are unable to manage our general and administrative expenses  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be harmed 
the level of our administrative expenses can affect our profitability  and we may not be able to manage our administrative expense in all circumstances 
while we attempt to effectively manage such expenses  including through the development of online functionalities and other projects designed to create administrative efficiencies  increases in staff related and other administrative expenses may occur from time to time 
these increases could be caused by any number of things  including difficulties or delays in projects designed to create administrative efficiencies  reliance on outsourced services  acquisitions and divestitures  business or product start ups or expansions  changes in business or regulatory requirements  including compliance with the aca  icd and hipaa regulations  or other reasons 
in addition  any failure to appropriately manage our general and administrative expenses could impact our ability to satisfy minimum medical loss ratio requirements  including those specified in the aca 
during recent years we have dedicated significant resources to implement programs designed to achieve general and administrative cost savings and improve our operational performance 
as a part of these programs  we have and will continue to contract with key strategic partners in an effort to lower our cost structure and incremental costs and consolidate business and management operations 
in addition  we are continuing to explore further opportunities to outsource certain other business process functions 
however  there can be no assurance that our strategies to reduce our general and administrative costs and improve our operation performance will be successful or achieve anticipated savings 
in addition  in order to offset some of the reduced revenues from the t contract  we are being required to reduce  reallocate or eliminate certain overhead and other administrative expenses 
we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in making these cuts and adjustments at a pace that will maintain or increase our profitability 
the markets in which we do business are highly competitive 
if we do not design and price our product offerings competitively  our membership and profitability could decline 
we are in a highly competitive industry 
many of our competitors may have certain characteristics  capabilities or resources  such as greater market share  superior provider and supplier arrangements and existing business relationships  that give them an advantage in competing with us 
these competitors include hmos  ppos  self funded employers  insurance companies  hospitals  health care facilities and other health care providers 
in addition  other companies may enter our markets in the future 
the addition of new competitors in our industry can occur relatively easily and customers enjoy significant flexibility in moving between competitors 
there is a risk that our customers may decide to perform for 
table of contents themselves functions or services currently provided by us  which could result in a decrease in our revenues 
in addition  our providers and suppliers may decide to market products and services to our customers in competition with us 
in addition  the response of our competitors to the aca and related adjustments to their offerings  if any  could cause meaningful disruption in local health care markets in which we operate 
competitors could modify their product features or benefits  change their pricing relative to others in the market  adjust their mix of business or even exit segments of the market 
we may not be able to match our competitors ability to support reduced premiums by making changes to their distribution arrangements  decreasing spending on non medical product features and services  or otherwise adjusting their operating costs and reducing general and administrative expenses 
in recent years  there has been significant merger and acquisition activity in our industry and in industries that act as our suppliers  such as the hospital  medical group  pharmaceutical and medical device industries 
this activity may create stronger competitors and or result in higher health care costs 
furthermore  the adoption of the aca could further increase the likelihood of provider consolidation  which in turn could make it more difficult for us to negotiate competitive rates 
in addition  our contracts with government agencies  such as our t north region and mflc contracts  are from time to time up for re bid and the loss of any significant government contract to a competitor  such as the t north region and mflc contracts  could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
see a significant reduction in revenues from the government programs in which we participate could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations for more information regarding our t north region and mflc contracts 
in addition  see item segment information western region operations segment medicaid and related products for more information regarding certain opportunities to expand our business with government customers that are subject to highly competitive processes 
to the extent that there is strong competition or that competition intensifies in any market  our ability to retain or increase customers  our revenue growth  our pricing flexibility  our control over medical cost trends and our marketing expenses may all be adversely affected 
the continued membership growth in our tailored network products and the continued development of innovative provider relationships are an important part of our business strategy 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement these strategic initiatives that are intended to position us for health care reform and future profitable growth  that the products we design in collaboration with certain providers will be successful or developed within the time periods expected  or that the products that we offer will be preferable to similar products of our competitors 
if we do not compete effectively in our markets  if we do not design and price our products appropriately and competitively  if we are unable to innovate and deliver products and services that demonstrate value to our customers  if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets  if we lose accounts with more profitable products while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with less profitable products  if we do not provide satisfactory service levels  if membership or demand for other services does not increase as we expect or if membership or demand for other services declines  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we face a wide range of risks  and our success depends on our ability to identify  prioritize and appropriately manage our enterprise risk exposures 
as a large company operating in a complex and highly regulated industry  we encounter a variety of risks 
the risks we face include  among others  the range of regulatory  competitive  financial  operational  reputational  external and industry risks identified in this risk factors discussion 
the third party vendors and service providers to which we outsource key functions are also required to achieve and maintain compliance with applicable federal and state laws and regulations 
any violations of  or noncompliance with  laws and or regulations governing our business  or the terms of our contracts  by third party vendors or service providers 
table of contents could increase our enterprise risk exposure 
as we consider further outsourcing of key functions  this risk increases 
we continue to devote resources to further develop and integrate our enterprise wide risk management processes 
failure to identify  prioritize and appropriately manage or mitigate these risks  including risk concentrations across different industries  segments and geographies  can adversely affect our profitability  our ability to retain or grow business or our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if we are unable to maintain good relations with the physicians  hospitals and other providers with which we contract  our profitability could be adversely affected 
we contract with physicians  hospitals and other providers as a means to provide access to health care services for our members  to manage health care costs and utilization and to better monitor the quality of care being delivered 
in any particular market  providers could refuse to contract with us  demand higher payments or take other actions  including litigation  which could result in higher health care costs  less desirable products for customers and members  disruption to provider access for current members or to support growth  or difficulty in meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements 
in some markets  certain providers  particularly hospitals  physician hospital organizations and multi specialty physician groups  may have significant market positions or even monopolies 
if these providers refuse to contract with us or utilize their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage  our ability to market our products or to be profitable in those areas could be adversely affected 
in the changing health care environment  our business strategy includes creating affordable and tailored customer solutions through  among other things  innovative provider relationships that effectively manage the cost of care 
for example  our product portfolios and services include offerings such as premiercare sm  excelcare sm and communitycare sm  which are recent collaborations with provider partners in california  arizona and oregon  respectively 
through these types of partnerships  we offer tailored network product offerings served by cost effective physician groups and hospitals 
membership in our tailored network products was approximately of total commercial risk membership as of december   compared with as of december  for additional information on our tailored network products and innovative provider relationships  see item segment information western region operations segment managed health care operations 
the continued membership growth in our tailored network products and the continued development of innovative provider relationships are an important part of our business strategy 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement these strategic initiatives that are intended to position us for health care reform and future profitable growth  that the products we design in collaboration with certain providers will be successful or developed within the time periods expected  or that the products that we offer will be preferable to similar products of our competitors 
failure to successfully implement this strategy may have an adverse impact on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
we contract with professional providers in california primarily through capitation fee arrangements 
under a capitation fee arrangement  we pay a provider group a fixed amount per member on a regular basis and the provider group accepts the risk of the frequency and cost of member utilization of professional services  and in some cases  institutional services 
provider groups that enter into capitation fee arrangements generally contract with primary care physicians  specialists and other secondary providers to provide services 
in addition  we frequently delegate responsibility for certain functions such as claims payment or utilization management to these providers 
the inability of provider groups to properly manage costs under capitation arrangements can result in their financial instability and the termination of their relationship with us 
a provider group s financial instability or failure to pay specialists or secondary providers for services rendered could be exacerbated by the current economic conditions  and could lead specialists or secondary providers to demand payment from us  even though we have made our capitated payments to the provider group 
depending on state law  we could be liable for such claims 
in california  for instance  although legal precedent to date has held that health plans are normally not liable for unpaid provider claims under these circumstances  there can be no assurance that the law will not change  or that we will not be found liable for unpaid provider claims in the future 
there can also be no assurance that providers with whom we contract will properly manage the costs of services  maintain financial 
table of contents solvency or avoid disputes with specialists or secondary providers  the failure of any of which could have an adverse effect on the provision of services to members and our operations 
our dependence on capitated provider groups is substantial in our western region operations 
approximately of our western region operations members were enrolled with capitated provider groups as of december  our strategy to expand commercial membership through tailored network products also places a greater emphasis on our relationships with certain capitated provider groups  as tailored network products restrict covered members access to certain physician groups 
if these capitated provider groups cannot provide comprehensive services to our members in tailored network products or encounter financial difficulties  it could have an adverse effect on the provision of services to members and our operations 
in addition  the use of tailored network products could create an increased risk of out of network claims issues  which could result in higher medical costs to us 
the provider groups that we contract with are also required to achieve and maintain compliance with applicable federal and state laws and regulations 
the inability of a provider group to pass compliance audits or otherwise maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations may cause us to terminate a contract with a provider or assume responsibility for the noncompliant functions  such as claims payment or utilization management 
furthermore  violations of  or noncompliance with  applicable laws and or regulations or contract terms by providers who perform delegated functions for us could increase our exposure to liability to our members or sanctions and or fines from the regulators that oversee our business  among other things 
if we fail to adequately monitor and regulate the performance of these delegated entities  we could be subject to additional risk

some providers that render services to our members and insureds who have coverage for out of network services  or who obtain out of network emergency services  are not contracted with our plans and insurance companies 
in those cases  there is no pre established understanding between the provider and the plan about the amount of compensation that is due to the provider  rather  the plan s obligation is to reimburse the member based upon the terms of the member s plan 
in some states and product lines  the amount of reimbursement is defined by law or regulation  but in other instances it is established by a standard set forth in the plan that is not clearly translated into dollar terms  such as maximum allowable amount or usual  customary and reasonable 
providers who render out of network services may believe they are underpaid for their services and may either litigate or arbitrate their dispute with the plan or balance bill our member 
regulatory authorities in various states may also challenge the manner in which we reimburse members for services performed by non contracted providers 
as a result of litigation or regulatory activity  we may have to pay providers additional amounts or reimburse members for their out of pocket payments 
the uncertainty about our financial obligations for such services and the possibility of subsequent adjustment of our original payments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
physicians and other professional providers  provider groups and hospitals that contract with us have in certain situations commenced litigation and or arbitration proceedings against us to recover amounts for which they allege we are liable  including amounts related to unpaid claims and amounts they allege to be underpayments due to them under their contracts with us 
we are currently a party to matters of this nature and could face additional claims or be subject to litigation and or arbitration proceedings in the future in connection with similar matters 
we believe that provider groups and hospitals have become increasingly sophisticated in their review of claim payments and contractual terms in an effort to maximize their payments from us and have increased their use of outside professionals  including accounting firms and attorneys  in these efforts 
these efforts and the litigation and arbitration that result from them could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents if the current unfavorable economic conditions continue or further deteriorate  it could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
the economic conditions in the united states continue to be challenging 
continued concerns about high unemployment rates  government debt  geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of credit and other capital  the us real estate market  consumer spending and other factors continue to negatively impact expectations for the us economy 
these events could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
these market conditions expose us to a number of risks  including risks associated with the potential financial instability of our customers 
if our customer base experiences cash flow problems or other financial difficulties  it could  in turn  adversely impact membership in our plans 
for example  our customers may modify  delay or cancel plans to purchase our products  or may make changes in the mix of products purchased from us 
if our customers experience financial issues  they may not be able to pay  or may delay payment of  accounts receivable that are owed to us 
further  our customers or potential customers may force us to compete more vigorously on factors such as price and service to retain or obtain their business  and in order to compete effectively in our markets  we also must deliver products and services that demonstrate value to our customers and that are designed and priced properly and competitively 
prior to the effective date of the aca s guaranteed issue requirement  the adverse economic conditions may also cause employers to stop offering certain health care coverage as an employee benefit or elect to offer this coverage on a voluntary  employee funded basis as a means to reduce their operating costs 
a significant decline in membership in our plans and the inability of current and or potential customers to pay their premiums as a result of unfavorable economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business  including our revenues  profitability and cash flow 
in addition  a prolonged economic downturn could negatively impact the financial position of hospitals and other providers and  as a result  could adversely affect our contracted rates with such parties and increase our medical costs 
high unemployment rates and significant employment layoffs and downsizings may also impact the number of enrollees in managed care programs and the profitability of our operations 
for example  in  our commercial membership decreased by percent due  in part  to the difficult economic conditions in the regions where we do business 
if economic conditions continue to be difficult and unemployment rates continue to be high  we may experience a reduction in existing and new business  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
largely as a result of the recent economic conditions and new members from california s spd program  we saw an increase in our medi cal membership of approximately  members  or  in however  the state of california is currently experiencing unprecedented budget deficits 
an extended economic downturn could continue to adversely affect state and federal budgets  including california s  resulting in reduced reimbursements or payments in our federal and state government health care coverage programs  including medicare  medi cal and chip 
a reduction in california s medi cal reimbursement rates could be implemented retrospectively to payments already negotiated and or received from the government and could adversely affect our revenues and financial results 
this risk is amplified as our medi cal membership increases 
see a significant reduction in revenues from the government programs in which we participate could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations for additional information regarding proposals to reduce california s medi cal provider reimbursement rates 
in addition  state and federal budgetary pressures could cause new or higher levels of assessments or taxes for our commercial programs  such as surcharges on select fee for service and capitated medical claims or premium taxes on insurance companies and health maintenance organizations  and could adversely affect our results of operations 
to help balance the budget  california has enacted measures to reduce certain provider reimbursements and introduce copayments for certain services 
for additional information regarding the proposed reductions in certain provider reimbursements  see a significant reduction in revenues from the government programs in which we participate could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
these changes would require federal approval  but if implemented  also could reduce the amounts of payments that we receive from the state in connection with our state health programs business 
moreover  any enrollment freeze or 
table of contents significant delay in reimbursement payment could adversely affect our business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
for example  due to budget issues  the state of california delayed several of its monthly medicaid payments to us 
although the state ultimately made these payments  the delays impacted our operating cash flow from quarter to quarter in the irregular timing of these payments could continue into and impact our cash flow 
if we fail to effectively maintain our information management systems  it could adversely affect our business 
our business depends significantly on effective and efficient information systems 
the information gathered and processed by our information management systems assists us in  among other things  pricing our services  monitoring utilization and other cost factors  processing provider claims  billing our customers on a timely basis and identifying accounts for collection 
our customers and providers also depend upon our information systems for membership verification  claims status and other information 
we have many different information systems for our various businesses and these systems require the commitment of significant resources for continual maintenance  upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational needs and evolving industry and regulatory standards 
we have partnered with third parties to support our information technology systems and to help design  build  test  implement and maintain our information management systems 
our merger  acquisition and divestiture activity also requires transitions to or from  and the integration of  various information management systems within our overall enterprise architecture 
we are in the process of reducing the number of systems that we operate 
any difficulty or unexpected delay associated with the transition to or from information systems  including in connection with the decommissioning of a system or the implementation of a new system  any inability or failure to properly maintain information management systems  any failure to efficiently and effectively consolidate our information systems  including to renew technology and maintain technology currency or eliminate redundant or obsolete applications  or any inability or failure to successfully update or expand processing capability or develop new capabilities to meet our business needs  could result in operational disruptions  loss of existing customers  difficulty in attracting new customers  disputes with customers and providers  regulatory or other legal or compliance problems  significant increases in administrative expenses and or other adverse consequences 
if for any reason there is a business continuity interruption resulting in loss of access to or availability of data  we may not be able to meet the full demands of our customers and  in turn  our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flow could be adversely impacted 
in addition  we obtain significant portions of our systems related and other services and facilities  including our data center  from independent third parties and are considering expanding our outsourced information technology arrangements 
this makes our operations vulnerable to adverse effects if such third parties fail to perform adequately 
see we are subject to risks associated with outsourcing services and functions to third parties 
the department of health and human services has mandated new standards in the electronic transmission of healthcare transactions  including claims  remittance  eligibility  claims status requests and related responses  and privacy and security standards  known as hipaa compliance with the new hipaa electronic data transaction standards was required by january   though cms recently announced that it will not enforce compliance with these standards until march  we have implemented the hipaa requirements to be able to exchange formats with our trading partners 
the failure of our trading partners to implement the hipaa requirements in a compliant manner could result in additional costs and administrative burden to us and have other adverse effects 
furthermore  cms has adopted a new coding set for diagnoses  commonly referred to as icd  which significantly expands the number of codes utilized 
the new icd coding set is currently required to be implemented by october we will be required to incur significant additional expenses to implement and support the new icd coding set and to support the hipaa requirements 
in addition  our implementation and support of the requirements of the aca could require the expenditure of significant resources 
if we have not adequately implemented hipaa and or do not adequately implement the requirements of the aca and icd  our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

table of contents in addition  we intend to enhance and modernize interactions with our customers  brokers  agents  providers  employees and other stakeholders through web enabled technology  among other things 
our failure to maintain successful e business capabilities could result in competitive and cost disadvantages for us as compared to our competitors 
we must comply with requirements relating to patient privacy and information security  including taking steps to ensure compliance by our business associates with hipaa 
the department of health and human services has regulations in place under hipaa relating to the privacy and security of protected health information phi 
these regulations  as amended  require health plans  clearinghouses and providers to  among other obligations comply with various requirements and restrictions related to the use  disclosure  storage  and transmission of phi  adopt rigorous internal policies and procedures to safeguard phi  and enter into specific written agreements with business associates that receive  use and or create phi on our behalf 
hipaa also established significant civil and criminal sanctions for violations 
these regulations expose us to liability for  among other things  violations of the regulations by our business associates  including the third party vendors involved in our outsourcing projects 
the health information technology for economic and clinical health act the hitech act  which became fully effective in february  expanded hipaa s requirements for security and privacy safeguards  including improved enforcement  additional limitations on use and disclosure of phi and additional potential penalties for violations  and imposed notice obligations in the event of a breach of unsecured phi 
although our contracts with our business associates provide for protections of phi by our business associates  we may have limited control over the actions and practices of our business associates 
compliance with hipaa and state and federal privacy and security laws and regulations has resulted in and may in the future result in significant costs to us due to necessary systems changes  the development of new administrative processes and the effects of potential noncompliance by us or our business associates 
see also if we fail to comply with requirements relating to patient privacy and information security  including taking steps to ensure that our business associates who obtain access to sensitive patient information maintain the privacy and security of such information  our reputation and business operations could be materially adversely affected 
if we fail to comply with requirements relating to patient privacy and information security  including taking steps to ensure that our business associates who obtain access to sensitive patient information maintain the privacy and security of such information  our reputation and business operations could be materially adversely affected 
the collection  maintenance  use  disclosure and disposal of individually identifiable health information or data  including phi  by our businesses are regulated at the federal and state levels 
despite the privacy and security measures we have in place to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations  our facilities and systems  and those of our third party vendors and service providers  are vulnerable to privacy and security incidents including  but not limited to  computer hacking  breaches  acts of vandalism or theft  computer viruses or other forms of cyber attack  misplaced or lost data  programming and or human errors or other similar events 
for example  in january  we were notified by a third party vendor that certain of our server drives could not be accounted for in connection with the migration of our data center to a facility owned and operated by our third party vendor 
we subsequently commenced an investigation of the contents of the unaccounted for server drives  including a detailed forensic review by computer experts  and determined that certain of these unaccounted for drives contain phi and other personally identifiable information relating to certain individuals 
we reported the loss to authorities and notified affected individuals 
this matter is under review by various regulatory authorities 
in addition  we  and our third party vendor  are currently party to various putative class action lawsuits brought in federal and state courts on behalf of individuals who claim to be affected by this incident 
see part i item legal proceedings and we face risks related to litigation  which  if resolved unfavorably  could result in substantial penalties and or monetary damages  including punitive damages 
in addition  we incur material expenses in the defense of litigation and our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and or liquidity 
table of contents could be adversely affected if litigation expenses are greater than we project for additional information about these actions and the associated risks 
a party  whether internal or external  that is able to circumvent our security systems could  among other things  misappropriate or misuse sensitive or confidential information including but not limited to phi and other member information  user information or other proprietary information  cause significant interruptions in our operations and cause all or portions of our website to be unavailable 
internal or external parties may attempt to circumvent our security systems  and we have experienced external attacks on our network such as disruptive internet requests being targeted at us 
while we currently expend significant resources to protect against cyber attacks and security breaches and have no evidence to suggest that such attacks have resulted in a breach of our systems  we may need to expend additional significant resources in the future to continue to protect against potential security breaches or to address problems caused by such attacks or any breach of our systems 
further  any reductions in the availability of our website could impair our ability to conduct our business and adversely impact our members during the occurrence of any such incident 
because the techniques used to circumvent security systems can be highly sophisticated and change frequently  often are not recognized until launched against a target and may originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world  we may be unable to proactively address all possible techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures for all situations 
noncompliance with any privacy laws or data security laws or any security incident or breach involving the misappropriation  loss or other unauthorized use or disclosure of sensitive or confidential member information  whether by us  one of our business associates or another third party  could have a material adverse effect on our business  reputation  financial condition and results of operations  including but not limited to material fines and penalties  compensatory  special  punitive  and statutory damages  litigation  consent orders regarding our privacy and security practices  requirements that we provide notices  credit monitoring services and or credit restoration services or other relevant services to impacted individuals  adverse actions against our licenses to do business  and injunctive relief 
additionally  the costs incurred to remediate any data security or privacy incident could be substantial 
under the agreements that govern the northeast sale  we have retained responsibility for certain liabilities of the acquired business  which could be substantial 
under the stock purchase agreement for the northeast sale  we are required to indemnify the buyer and its affiliates for all pre closing liabilities of the acquired business and for a broad range of excluded liabilities  including liabilities arising out of the acquired business incurred through the winding up and running out period of the acquired business 
the stock purchase agreement does not limit the amount or duration of our obligations to the buyer and its affiliates with respect to these indemnities 
as a result  in the event that the amount of these liabilities was to exceed our expectations  we could be responsible to the buyer and its affiliates for substantial indemnification obligations  which could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have a material amount of indebtedness and may incur additional indebtedness  or need to refinance existing indebtedness  in the future  which may adversely affect our operations 
our indebtedness includes million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in addition  we have a million five year revolving credit facility that expires in october as of december   we had million outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
for a description of our senior notes and our revolving credit facility  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources capital structure 
we may incur additional debt in the future 
our existing indebtedness  and any additional debt we incur in the future through drawings on our revolving credit facility or otherwise could have an adverse effect on our business and future operations 
for example  it could 
table of contents require us to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our debt  which would reduce funds available to fund stock repurchases  working capital  capital expenditures and other general operating requirements  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business  and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt 
we continually evaluate options to refinance our outstanding indebtedness 
our ability to obtain any financing  whether through the issuance of new debt securities or otherwise  and the terms of any such financing are dependent on  among other things  our financial condition  financial market conditions within our industry and generally  credit ratings and numerous other factors 
in the past  credit markets experienced unusual uncertainty  and liquidity and access to capital markets continue to be constrained 
concern about the stability of the markets generally has led many lenders to reduce and in some cases cease to provide funding to borrowers 
see if the current unfavorable economic conditions continue or further deteriorate  it could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
consequently  in the event we need to access the credit markets  including to refinance our debt  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain financing on terms and within a time acceptable to us it could  in addition to other negative effects  have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial condition  ability to compete or ability to comply with regulatory requirements 
downgrades in our debt ratings may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
claims paying ability  financial strength  and debt ratings by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations are increasingly important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies and managed care companies 
we believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings also are important factors in marketing our products to certain of our customers 
in addition  our debt ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings and  accordingly  our cost of capital 
rating agencies review our ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that our current ratings will be maintained in the future 
our ratings reflect each rating agency s independent opinion of our financial strength  operating performance  ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders and other factors  and are subject to change 
potential downgrades from ratings agencies  should they occur  may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are a holding company and substantially all of our cash flow is generated by our subsidiaries 
our regulated subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on the payment of dividends and maintenance of minimum levels of capital 
as a holding company  our subsidiaries conduct substantially all of our consolidated operations and own substantially all of our consolidated assets 
consequently  our cash flow and our ability to pay our debt depends  in part  on the amount of cash that we receive from our subsidiaries 
our subsidiaries ability to make any payments to us will depend on their earnings  business and tax considerations  legal and regulatory restrictions and economic conditions 
under the california knox keene health care service plan act of  as amended  certain of our subsidiaries must comply with certain minimum capital or tangible net equity tne requirements 
in addition  certain of our subsidiaries have agreed to certain undertakings to the department of managed health care  restricting dividends and loans to affiliates  to the extent that the payment of such would reduce its tne below of the minimum requirement  or reduce its cash to claims ratio below in addition  in certain states our regulated subsidiaries are subject to risk based capital requirements  known as rbc 
these laws require our regulated subsidiaries to report their results of risk based capital calculations to the departments of insurance in their state of domicile and the national association of insurance commissioners 
failure to maintain the minimum rbc standards could subject certain of our regulated subsidiaries to corrective 
table of contents action  including increased reporting and or state supervision 
in addition  in most states  we are required to seek prior approval before we transfer money or pay dividends from our regulated subsidiaries that exceed specified amounts 
if our regulated subsidiaries are restricted from paying us dividends or otherwise making cash transfers to us  it could have material adverse effect on our results of operations and free cash flow

our revolving credit facility contains restrictive covenants that could limit our ability to pursue our business strategies 
on october   we entered into a million five year revolving credit facility 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources capital structure for additional information regarding our revolving credit facility 
our revolving credit facility requires us to comply with various covenants that impose restrictions on our operations  including our ability to incur additional indebtedness  create liens  pay dividends  make investments or other restricted payments  sell or otherwise dispose of assets and engage in other activities 
our revolving credit facility also requires us to comply with certain financial covenants  including a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources capital structure revolving credit facility for details regarding our revolving credit facility 
the restrictive covenants under our revolving credit facility could limit our ability to pursue our business strategies 
in addition  any failure by us to comply with these restrictive covenants could result in an event of default under the revolving credit facility and  in some circumstances  under the indenture governing our senior notes  which  in any case  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
acquisitions  divestitures and other significant transactions may adversely affect our business 
we continue to evaluate the profitability realized or that we expect to be realized by our existing businesses and operations 
from time to time we review  from a strategic standpoint  potential acquisitions and divestitures in light of our core businesses and growth strategies 
the success of any such acquisition or divestiture depends  in part  upon our ability to identify suitable buyers or sellers  negotiate favorable contractual terms and  in many cases  obtain governmental approval 
for acquisitions  success is also dependent upon efficiently integrating the acquired business into our existing operations 
for divestitures  success may also be dependent upon efficiently reducing general and administrative or other functions for our remaining operations 
in the event the structure of the transaction results in continuing obligations by the buyer to us or our customers  a buyer s inability to fulfill these obligations could lead to future financial loss on our part 
as a seller  we may have significant continuing indemnification  administrative services or other obligations to the buyer 
potential acquisitions or divestitures present financial  managerial and operational challenges  including diversion of management attention from existing businesses  difficulty with integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems  significant post closing obligations  increased expenses  assumption of unknown liabilities  indemnities and potential disputes with the buyers or sellers 
on january   we announced that our subsidiary  hnl  has entered into a definitive agreement to sell its medicare stand alone prescription drug plan business to an affiliate of cvs caremark for approximately million in cash 
the sale is subject to closing conditions and regulatory approvals  including approval from cms  and is expected to close in the second quarter of in addition  the asset purchase agreement entered into in connection with the transaction contains certain termination rights  including that either party may terminate the asset purchase agreement if the closing does not occur prior to may  if the asset purchase agreement is terminated for any reason  hnl will be obligated to pay a termination fee of million to the buyer 
among the other risks discussed above  if the transaction does not close or  if it closes and we are unable 
table of contents to reduce our general and administrative or other functions for our remaining operations  this could have an adverse impact on our business and financial condition 
the value of our intangible assets may become impaired 
goodwill and other intangible assets represent a significant portion of our assets 
goodwill and other intangible assets were approximately million as of december   representing approximately percent of our total assets and percent of our consolidated stockholders equity at december  in accordance with applicable accounting standards  we periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may be impaired  in which case a charge to income may be necessary 
this impairment testing requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding estimated fair value including assumptions and estimates related to future earnings and membership levels based on current and future plans and initiatives  long term strategies and our annual planning and forecasting processes  as well as the expected weighted average cost of capital used in the discount process 
if estimated fair values are less than the carrying values of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives in future impairment tests  or if significant impairment indicators are noted relative to other intangible assets subject to amortization  we may be required to record impairment losses against income 
any future evaluations requiring an impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially impact our results of operations and stockholders equity in the period in which the impairment occurs 
a material decrease in stockholders equity could  in turn  negatively impact our debt ratings or potentially impact our compliance with existing debt covenants 
from time to time  we divest businesses that we believe are less of a strategic fit for the company or do not produce an adequate return 
any such divestiture could result in significant asset impairment charges  including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the value of our investment portfolio and our goodwill could be adversely impacted by varying economic and market conditions which could  in turn  have a negative effect on our results of operations and stockholders equity 
our investment portfolio is comprised primarily of available for sale investment securities such as interest yielding debt securities of varying maturities 
as of december   our available for sale investment securities were approximately billion 
the value of fixed income securities is highly sensitive to fluctuations in short and long term interest rates  with the value decreasing as such rates increase and increasing as such rates decrease 
these securities may also be negatively impacted by illiquidity in the market 
we closely monitor the fair values of our investment securities and regularly evaluate them for any other than temporary impairments 
we have the intent and ability to hold our investments for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery of the principal amount invested 
the current economic environment and uncertainty in the us and global capital markets have negatively impacted the liquidity of investments  such as the debt securities we hold  and a worsening in these markets could have additional negative effects on the liquidity and value of our investment assets 
in addition  such uncertainty has increased the difficulty of assessing investment impairment and the same influences tend to increase the risk of potential impairment of these assets 
over time  the economic and capital market environment may further decline or provide additional insight regarding the fair value of certain securities  which could change our judgment regarding the impairment of certain investments 
this could result in realized losses relating to other than temporary declines being charged against future income 
there is continuing risk that declines in fair value may occur and material other than temporary impairments may result in realized losses in future periods  which could have an adverse effect on our 
table of contents results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources for additional information regarding our investment portfolio 
in addition  our regulated subsidiaries are also subject to state laws and regulations that govern the types of investments that are allowable and admissible in those subsidiaries portfolios 
there can be no assurance that our investment assets will produce total positive returns or that we will not sell investments at prices that are less than the carrying value of these investments 
changes in the value of our investment assets  as a result of interest rate fluctuations  illiquidity or otherwise  could have a negative effect on our stockholders equity 
in addition  if it became necessary for us to liquidate our investment portfolio on an accelerated basis  it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
if our stock price experiences significant fluctuations or if our market capitalization materially declines  we could be required to take an impairment charge to reduce the carrying amount of our goodwill 
if we were required to take such a charge  it would be non cash and would not affect our liquidity or financial condition  but could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the charge was taken 
at the closing of the northeast sale  we entered into a non competition agreement with the buyer that contains prohibitions which could negatively impact our prospects  business  financial condition or results of operations 
under the stock purchase agreement  at the closing of the transactions contemplated by the agreement  we entered into a non competition agreement with the buyer  pursuant to which we generally are prohibited from competing with the acquired business in the states of new york  new jersey  connecticut and rhode island for a period of five years from the closing  and from engaging in certain other restricted activities 
although we currently do not have any intention to engage in such prohibited activities during the term of the non competition agreement  circumstances could change and it may become in our best interests to engage in a business that is prohibited by the agreement 
if this were to occur  in order to engage in the business we would be required to obtain the buyer s consent under the non competition agreement  which the buyer could withhold in its discretion 
in the event that we are unable to engage in a business due to the terms of the non competition agreement  this could have an adverse effect on our prospects  business  financial condition or results of operations 
we depend  in part  on independent brokers and sales agents to market our products and services  and recent regulatory investigations have focused on certain brokerage practices  including broker compensation arrangements and bid quoting practices 
we market our products and services both through sales people employed by us and through independent sales agents 
independent sales agents typically do not work with us on an exclusive basis and may market health care products and services of our competitors 
we face intense competition for the services and allegiance of independent sales agents and we cannot assure you that these agents will continue to market our products at a reasonable cost 
although we have a number of sales employees and agents  if key sales employees or agents or a large subset of these individuals were to leave us  our ability to retain existing customers and members could be impaired 
the aca includes broker and agent commissions as administrative expenses for purposes of calculating the minimum medical loss ratio 
as a result  these expenses will be under the same cost reduction pressures as other administrative costs of health insurers  and there is pressure to make changes to existing commission structures for brokers and agents 
for example  some of our competitors have reduced the commissions payable to brokers and agents for sales in the individual market  and we have implemented similar reductions in the individual market in california 
our relationships with brokers and agents could be adversely impacted by changes in our business practices to address these pressures  including potential reductions in commissions and changes in the treatment of consulting fees 

table of contents there have been a number of investigations and enforcement actions against insurance brokers and insurers over the last several years regarding allegedly inappropriate or undisclosed payments made by insurers to brokers for the placement of insurance business 
for example  cms has increased its scrutiny of insurance brokers and insurers regarding allegedly improper sales and marketing practices in connection with the sale of medicare products 
while we are not aware of any unlawful practices by the company or any of our agents or brokers in connection with the marketing and sales of our products and services  we could be sanctioned as a result of unlawful acts by our agents or brokers 
in addition  investigations by state attorneys general  cms and other regulators  as well as regulatory changes initiated in several states in response to allegedly inappropriate broker conduct and broker payment practices  could result in changes in industry practices or negative publicity that could have an adverse effect on our ability to market our products 
we are dependent on our ability to recruit  manage  enable and retain a large workforce 
our products and services and our operations require a large number of employees 
as of december   we employed  individuals on a full time basis and individuals on a part time or temporary basis 
it is critical that we recruit  manage  enable and retain talent to successfully execute our strategic objectives  which requires aligned policies  a positive work environment and a robust succession and talent development process 
further  particularly in light of the changing healthcare environment  we must focus on building employee capabilities to help ensure that we can meet upcoming challenges and opportunities 
our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to recruit  manage  enable and retain talent and meet upcoming challenges and opportunities 
in addition  the impact of the external or internal environment or other factors on employee morale  enablement and engagement could also significantly impact the success of the company 
our forecasts and other forward looking statements are based on a variety of assumptions that are subject to significant uncertainties 
our performance may not be consistent with these forecasts and forward looking statements 
from time to time in press releases and otherwise  we publish forecasts or other forward looking statements regarding our future results  including estimated revenues  net earnings and other operating and financial metrics 
any forecast of our future performance reflects various assumptions 
these assumptions are subject to significant uncertainties  and  as a matter of course  any number of them may prove to be incorrect 
the achievement of any forecast depends on numerous risks and other factors  including those described in this report  many of which are beyond our control 
in addition  the challenging economic conditions and uncertainties associated with health care reform  among other things  may make it particularly difficult to forecast our future performance 
as a result  we cannot assure that our performance will meet any management forecasts or that the variation from such forecasts will not be material and adverse 
you are cautioned not to base your entire analysis of our business and prospects upon isolated predictions  but instead are encouraged to utilize the entire mix of publicly available historical and forward looking information  as well as other available information affecting us  our services  and our industry when evaluating our forecasts and other forward looking statements relating to our operations and financial performance 
the market price of our common stock is volatile

there can be no assurances regarding the level or stability of our share price at any time or the impact of these or any other factors on our stock price 
negative publicity regarding the managed health care industry could adversely affect our ability to market and sell our products and services 
managed health care companies have received and continue to receive negative publicity reflecting the public perception of the industry 
for example  the company and the managed health care industry have been subject to negative publicity surrounding premium rate increases 
in addition  health care and related health care reform and proposals have been and are expected to continue to be the subject of intense media attention and political debate 
such political discourse can often generate publicity that portrays managed care in a negative light 
our marketing efforts may be affected by the amount of negative publicity to which the industry has been subject  as well as by speculation and uncertainty relating to merger and acquisition activity among companies in our industry 
speculation  uncertainty or negative publicity about us  our industry or our lines of business could adversely affect our ability to market and sell our products or services  require changes to our products or services  or stimulate additional legislation  regulation  review of industry practices or litigation that could adversely affect us 
we have historically experienced significant turnover in senior management 
if we are unable to manage the succession of our key executives  it could adversely affect our business 
we have experienced a high turnover in our senior management team in the recent past and could experience high turnover in the future 
although we have succession plans in place and have employment arrangements with our key executives  these do not guarantee that the services of these key executives will continue to be available to us 
we would be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for future turnover of our senior management team 
it may be difficult for a third party to acquire us  which could decrease the value of your shares of our common stock 
we are subject to the delaware anti takeover laws regulating corporate takeovers 
these provisions may prohibit stockholders owning or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us 
in addition  federal antitrust laws apply to us  and any change in control of our state health plans or health insurance companies also would require the approvals of the applicable regulatory agencies in each state in which we operate 
in addition to the rights agreement  our certificate of incorporation and bylaws also contain provisions that could have the effect of delaying  deferring  or preventing a change in control of the company that our stockholders may consider favorable or beneficial 
these provisions could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions 
these provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock 
large scale public health epidemics and or terrorist activity could cause us to incur unexpected health care and other costs and could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
an outbreak of a pandemic disease and or future terrorist activities  including bio terrorism  could materially and adversely affect the us economy in general and the health care industry specifically 
depending 
table of contents on the government s actions and the responsiveness of public health agencies and insurance companies  a large scale public health epidemic or future acts of bio terrorism could lead to  among other things  increased use of health care services  disruption of information and payment systems  increased health care costs due to increased in patient and out patient hospital costs and the cost of any anti viral medication used to treat affected people 
disasters  including earthquakes  fires and floods  could severely damage or interrupt our systems and operations and result in an adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
disasters such as fires  floods  earthquakes  tornados  power losses  virus outbreaks  telecommunications failures  break ins or similar events could severely damage or interrupt our systems and operations  result in loss of data  and or delay or impair our ability to service our members and providers 
we have in place a disaster recovery plan which is intended to provide us with the ability to recover our critical information technology systems in the event of a natural disaster utilizing various alternate sites provided by a national disaster recovery vendor 
however  there can be no assurance that such adverse effects will not occur in the event of a disaster 
any such disaster or similar event could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations

item legal proceedings 
litigation and investigations related to unaccounted for server drives we are a defendant in three related litigation matters pending in california state and federal courts relating to information security issues 
on january   international business machines corp 
ibm  which handles our data center operations  notified us that it could not locate several hard disk drives that had been used in our data center located in rancho cordova  california 
we have since determined that personal information of 
table of contents approximately two million former and current health net members  employees and health care providers is on the drives 
commencing on march   we provided written notification to the individuals whose information is on the drives 
to help protect the personal information of affected individuals  we offered them two years of free credit monitoring services  in addition to identity theft insurance and fraud resolution and restoration of credit files services  if needed 
on march   a putative class action relating to this incident was filed against us in the us district court for the central district of california the central district of california  and similar actions were later filed against us in other federal and state courts in california 
a number of those actions were transferred to and consolidated in the us district court for the eastern district of california the eastern district of california  and the two remaining actions are currently pending in the superior court of california  county of san francisco san francisco county superior court and the us district court for the central district of california 
the consolidated amended complaint in the federal action pending in the eastern district of california is filed on behalf of a putative class of over  of our current or former members who received the written notification  and also names ibm as a defendant 
it seeks to state claims for violation of the california confidentiality of medical information act and the california customer records act  and seeks statutory damages of up to  for each class member  as well as injunctive and declaratory relief  attorneys fees and other relief 
on august   we filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint 
on january   the court issued an order dismissing the complaint on the grounds that the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring their action in federal court  and gave the plaintiffs thirty days to file an amended complaint 
on february   the court entered an order approving a stipulation giving the plaintiffs an additional sixty days  until april   to file an amended complaint 
the other federal court proceeding was instituted on july  in the superior court of california  county of riverside and is brought on behalf of a putative nationwide class of all former and current members affected by this incident  and seeks to state similar claims against us  as well as a claim for invasion of privacy 
we removed this case to the central district of california on august  on august   the plaintiff filed a motion to remand the case to state court 
that motion was granted on september  on october   we filed an application for leave to appeal the remand order to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
on january   the court of appeals granted the motion for leave to appeal and ordered the parties to submit briefs 
the appeal is scheduled for oral argument on march  we have not yet filed a response to the complaint in this action 
the san francisco superior court proceeding was instituted on march  and is brought on behalf of a putative class of california residents who received the written notification  and seeks to state similar claims against us  as well as claims for violation of california s unfair competition law  and seeks similar relief 
we moved to compel arbitration of the two named plaintiffs claims 
the court granted our motion as to one of the named plaintiffs and denied it as to the other 
we are appealing the latter ruling 
thereafter  the plaintiff as to whom our motion to compel arbitration was granted filed an application for a writ of mandate with the california court of appeal seeking review of that ruling 
we filed an opposition to that application 
on january   the court of appeals issued an order indicating it might issue a peremptory writ regarding the enforceability of the arbitration agreement and inviting the parties to submit additional briefing 
we have also been informed that a number of regulatory agencies are investigating the incident  including the california department of managed health care  the california department of insurance  the california attorney general  the connecticut attorney general  the connecticut department of insurance  and the office of civil rights of the us department of health and human services 
we intend to vigorously defend ourselves against these claims  however  these proceedings are subject to many uncertainties 
at this time we cannot reasonably estimate the range of loss that may result from these legal and regulatory proceedings in light of the facts that i legal and regulatory proceedings are inherently unpredictable  ii there are multiple parties in each of the disputes and uncertainty as to how liability  if any  
table of contents may be shared among the defendants  iii the proceedings are in their early stages and discovery is not complete  iv there are significant facts in dispute  v the matters present legal uncertainties  vi there is a wide range of potential outcomes in each dispute and vii there are various levels of judicial review available to us in each matter in the event damages are awarded or fines or penalties are assessed 
nevertheless  an adverse resolution of or development in the proceedings could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and liquidity and could affect our reputation 
miscellaneous proceedings in the ordinary course of our business operations  we are subject to periodic reviews  investigations and audits by various federal and state regulatory agencies with respect to our compliance with a wide variety of rules and regulations applicable to our business  including  without limitation  the health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa  rules relating to pre authorization penalties  payment of out of network claims  timely review of grievances and appeals  and timely and accurate payment of claims  any one of which may result in remediation of certain claims  contract termination  the loss of licensure or the right to participate in certain programs  and the assessment of regulatory fines or penalties  which could be substantial 
from time to time  we receive subpoenas and other requests for information from  and are subject to investigations by  such regulatory agencies  as well as from state attorneys general 
there also continues to be heightened review by regulatory authorities of  and increased litigation regarding  the health care industry s business practices  including  without limitation  information privacy  premium rate increases  utilization management  appeal and grievance processing  rescission of insurance coverage and claims payment practices 
in addition  in the ordinary course of our business operations  we are party to various other legal proceedings  including  without limitation  litigation arising out of our general business activities  such as contract disputes  employment litigation  wage and hour claims  real estate and intellectual property claims  claims brought by members or providers seeking coverage or additional reimbursement for services allegedly rendered to our members  but which allegedly were denied  underpaid  not timely paid or not paid  and claims arising out of the acquisition or divestiture of various business units or other assets 
we are also subject to claims relating to the performance of contractual obligations to providers  members  employer groups and others  including the alleged failure to properly pay claims and challenges to the manner in which we process claims  and claims alleging that we have engaged in unfair business practices 
in addition  we are subject to claims relating to information security incidents and breaches  reinsurance agreements  rescission of coverage and other types of insurance coverage obligations and claims relating to the insurance industry in general 
we are  and may be in the future  subject to class action lawsuits brought against various managed care organizations and other class action lawsuits 
we intend to vigorously defend ourselves against the miscellaneous legal and regulatory proceedings to which we are currently a party  however  these proceedings are subject to many uncertainties 
in some of the cases pending against us  substantial non economic or punitive damages are being sought 
we record reserves and accrue costs for certain legal proceedings and regulatory matters to the extent that we determine an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
while such reserves and accrued costs reflect our best estimate of the probable loss for such matters  our recorded amounts may differ materially from the actual amount of any such losses 
in some cases  no estimate of the possible loss or range of loss in excess of amounts accrued  if any  can be made because of the inherently unpredictable nature of legal and regulatory proceedings  which may be exacerbated by various factors  including but not limited to that they may involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines  penalties or punitive damages  present novel legal theories  involve disputed facts  represent a shift in regulatory policy  involve a large number of parties  claimants or regulatory bodies  are in the early stages of the proceedings  or could result in a change of business practices 
further  there may be various levels of judicial review available to the company in connection with any such proceeding in the event damages are awarded or a fine or penalty is assessed 
it is possible that in a particular quarter or annual period our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and or liquidity could be materially adversely affected by an ultimate unfavorable 
table of contents resolution of or development in legal and or regulatory proceedings  including those described above in this item under the heading litigation and investigations related to unaccounted for server drives  depending  in part  upon our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow or liquidity in such period  and our reputation may be adversely affected 
except for the regulatory and legal proceedings discussed in this item under the heading litigation and investigations related to unaccounted for server drives  management believes that the ultimate outcome of any of the regulatory and legal proceedings which are currently pending against us should not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and liquidity 
potential settlements we regularly evaluate legal proceedings and regulatory matters pending against us  including those described above in this item  to determine if settlement of such matters would be in the best interests of the company and its stockholders 
the costs associated with any settlement of the various legal proceedings and regulatory matters to which we are or may be subject from time to time  including those described above in this item  could be substantial and  in certain cases  could result in a significant earnings charge in any particular quarter in which we enter into a settlement agreement and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and or liquidity and may affect our reputation

how we measure our profitability our profitability depends in large part on our ability to  among other things  effectively price our health care products  manage health care costs  and pharmacy costs  contract with health care providers  attract and retain members  and manage our general and administrative g a and selling expenses 
in addition  factors such as state and federal health care reform legislation and regulation  competition and general economic conditions affect our operations and profitability 
the effect of escalating health care costs  as well as any changes in our ability to negotiate competitive rates with our providers  may impose further risks to our ability to profitably underwrite our business  and may have a material impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we measure our western region operations reportable segment profitability based on medical care ratio mcr and pretax income 
the mcr is calculated as health plan services expense divided by health plan services premiums 
the pretax income is calculated as health plan services premiums and administrative services fees and other income less health plan services expense and g a and other net expenses 
see results of operations western region operations reportable segment western region operations segment results for a calculation of the mcr and pretax income 
health plan services premiums include health maintenance organization hmo  point of service pos and preferred provider organization ppo premiums from employer groups and individuals and from medicare recipients who have purchased supplemental benefit coverage which premiums are based on a predetermined prepaid fee  medicaid revenues based on multi year contracts to provide care to medicaid recipients  and revenue under medicare risk contracts  including medicare part d  to provide care to enrolled medicare recipients 
medicare revenue can also include amounts for risk factor adjustments and additional premiums that we charge in some places to members who purchase our medicare risk plans 
the amount of premiums we earn in a given period is driven by the rates we charge and enrollment levels 
administrative services fees and other income primarily include revenue for administrative services such as claims processing  customer service  medical management  provider network access and other administrative services 
health plan services expense includes medical and related costs for health services provided to our members  including physician services  hospital and related professional services  outpatient care  and pharmacy benefit costs 
these expenses are impacted by unit costs and utilization rates 
unit costs represent the health care cost per visit  and the utilization rates represent the volume of health care consumption by our members 
g a expenses include those costs related to employees and benefits  consulting and professional fees  marketing  business expansion initiatives  premium taxes and assessments  occupancy costs and litigation and regulatory related costs 
such costs are driven by membership levels  introduction of new products  system consolidations  outsourcing activities and compliance requirements for changing regulations  among other things 
these expenses also include expenses associated with corporate shared services and other costs to reflect the fact that such expenses are incurred primarily to support health plan services 
selling expenses consist of external broker commission expenses and generally vary with premium volume 
we measure our government contracts segment profitability based on pretax income  which is calculated as government contracts revenue less government contracts cost 
see results of operations government contracts reportable segment government contracts segment results for a calculation of the government contracts pretax income 

table of contents under the t contract for the tricare north region  we provide various types of administrative services including provider network management  referral management  medical management  disease management  enrollment  customer service  clinical support service  and claims processing 
we also provide assistance in the transition into and out of the t contract 
these services are structured as cost reimbursement arrangements for health care costs plus administrative fees earned in the form of fixed prices  fixed unit prices  and contingent fees and payments based on various incentives and penalties 
we recognize revenue related to administrative services on a straight line basis over the option period  when the fees become fixed and determinable 
the tricare north region members are served by our network and out of network providers in accordance with the t contract 
we pay health care costs related to these services to the providers and are later reimbursed by the dod for such payments 
under the terms of the t contract  we are not the primary obligor for health care services and accordingly  we do not include health care costs and related reimbursements in our consolidated statement of operations 
the t contract also includes various performance based incentives and penalties 
for each of the incentives or penalties  we adjust revenue accordingly based on the amount that we have earned or incurred at each interim date and are legally entitled to in the event of a contract termination 
see note to our consolidated financial statements under the heading t tricare contract for additional information on our t contract 
under our previous tricare contract for the north region  government contracts revenue was made up of two major components health care and administrative services 
the health care component included revenue recorded for health care costs for the provision of services to our members  including paid claims and estimated incurred but not reported claims ibnr expenses for which we were at risk  and underwriting fees earned for providing the health care and assuming underwriting risk in the delivery of care 
the administrative services component encompassed fees received for all other services provided to both the government customer and to beneficiaries  including services such as medical management  claims processing  enrollment  customer services and other services unique to the managed care support contract with the government 
government contracts revenue and expenses included the impact from underruns and overruns relative to our target cost under the applicable contracts 
we measure our northeast operations segment profitability based on pretax income 
the pretax income is calculated as northeast operations segment total revenues  including northeast administrative services fees  less northeast segment total expenses  including northeast administrative services expenses 
under the united administrative services agreements  which terminated on july   we provided claims processing  customer services  medical management  provider network access and other administrative services to united and certain of its affiliates 
administrative services fees were recognized as revenue in the period services were provided 
upon the termination of the united administrative services agreements  claims servicing agreements became effective with united and certain of its affiliates pursuant to which we continue to adjudicate run out claims and perform limited other administrative services

health care reform legislation during the first quarter of  the president signed into law both the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of collectively  the aca  which is causing and will continue to cause significant changes to the us health care system and alter the dynamics of the health care insurance industry 
the provisions of the new legislation include  among others  imposing significant new taxes and fees on health insurers that may not be deductible for income tax purposes  including a health insurer fee on fully insured premiums and an excise tax on high premium insurance policies  stipulating a minimum medical loss ratio as adopted by the secretary of the us department of health and human services hhs  limiting medicare advantage payment rates  increasing mandated benefits  eliminating medical underwriting for medical insurance coverage decisions  or guaranteed issue  increasing restrictions on rescinding coverage  or rescissions  prohibiting some annual and all lifetime limits on amounts paid on behalf 
table of contents of or to our members  limiting the ability of health plans to vary premiums based on assessments of underlying risk  limiting the amount of compensation paid to health insurance executives that is tax deductible  expanding regulations that govern premium rate increase requests  in addition to requirements that individuals obtain coverage and the creation of government controlled exchanges where individuals and small business groups may purchase health coverage 
some provisions of the health care reform legislation became effective in  including those that increase the restrictions on rescissions  those that bar health insurance companies from placing lifetime limits on essential benefits  which are only partially defined  those that prohibit annual limits below specified caps for essential benefits for some benefit plans and those that require health plans to cover certain out of network services with no additional co pay to their enrollees 
some provisions that significantly increase federal regulation of the handling of appeals and grievances were to become effective in  but enforcement of certain of the provisions was postponed until july  and a subset of those again until january  various aspects of the health care reform legislation could have an adverse impact on our revenues  enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments and the cost of operating our business 
among other things  the legislation will require premium rate review in certain market segments  and require premium rebates in the event minimum medical loss ratios are not met 
we do not believe that we will be required to pay a material amount in rebates with respect to our business  however  we cannot be certain that we will not be required to pay material amounts in rebates in the future 
in addition  the legislation will lower the rates of medicare payments we receive  may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain members  and will increase the amount of certain taxes and fees we pay  which is expected to increase our effective tax rate in future periods 
however  we are unable to estimate the amount of these fees and taxes or the increase in our effective tax rate because material information and guidance regarding the calculations of these fees and taxes has not been issued 
the new legislation will also impose a sales tax on medical device manufacturers and increase the amount of fees pharmaceutical manufacturers pay both of which in turn could increase our medical costs 
we could also face additional competition as competitors seize on opportunities to expand their business as a result of the new legislation  though there remains considerable uncertainty about the impact of these changes on the health insurance market as a whole and what actions our competitors could take 
the response of other companies to the aca and related adjustments to their offerings  if any  could cause meaningful disruption in the local health care markets 
for example  companies could modify their product features or benefits  change their pricing relative to others in the market  adjust their mix of business or even exit segments of the market 
companies could also seek to adjust their operating costs to support reduced premiums by making changes to their distribution arrangements  decreasing spending on non medical product features and services  or otherwise reducing general and administrative expenses 
because of the magnitude  scope and complexity of the new legislation  we also need to dedicate substantial resources and incur material expenses to implement the new legislation  including implementing the current and future regulations that will provide guidance and clarification on important parts of the legislation 
any delay or failure by us to execute our operational and strategic initiatives with respect to health care reform or otherwise appropriately react to the legislation  implementing regulations and actions of our competitors could result in operational disruptions  disputes with our providers or members  regulatory issues  damage to our existing or potential member relationships or other adverse consequences 
there are numerous steps required to implement this legislation  with clarifying regulations and other guidance expected over several years 
as a result  many of the impacts of health care reform will not be known for certain until the ultimate requirements of the legislation have been definitively determined 
adding to the uncertainty  there also have been congressional and legal challenges to federal health care reform that  if ultimately successful  could result in changes to the existing legislation or the repeal of aca in its entirety 
at this time  it remains unclear whether there will be any changes made to the aca  whether to certain provisions or its entirety 
various health insurance reform proposals are also emerging at the state level 
many of the states in which we operate are already implementing parts of the federal health care reform and many states have added new requirements that are more exacting than the federal health care reform requirements 
also  many states may 
table of contents continue to consider legislation to extend coverage to the uninsured through medicaid expansions  mandate minimum medical loss ratios  implement rate reforms and enact benefit mandates that go beyond essential benefits 
in addition  some states have passed legislation or are considering proposals to establish an insurance exchange within the state to comply with provisions of the health care reform legislation that become effective in these kinds of state regulations and legislations could increase the pressure on us to contain our premium prices and thereby could negatively impact our revenues and profitability 
this also could increase the competition we face from companies that have lower health care or administrative costs than we do and therefore can price their premiums at lower levels than we can 
even in cases where state action is limited to implementing federal reforms  new or amended state laws will be required in many cases 
states also may disagree in their interpretations of the federal statute and regulations  and state guidance that is issued could be unclear or untimely 
the interaction of new federal regulations and the implementation efforts of the various states in which we do business will create substantial uncertainty for us and other health insurance companies about the requirements under which we must operate 
due to the unsettled nature of these reforms and the numerous steps required to implement them  we cannot predict how future regulations and laws  including state laws  implementing the health care reform legislation will impact our business 
to date  the legislation has not had a material adverse impact on our business  financial results and results of operations 
however  in the future  depending in part on the ultimate requirements of the legislation  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations

days claims payable days claims payable dcp for the year ended december  was days compared with days for the year ended december  on an adjusted basis adjusting to exclude capitation  provider and other claim settlements and medicare advantage prescription drug mapd and stand alone pdp payables costs  dcp in the year ended december  was days compared with days in the year ended december  set forth below is a reconciliation of adjusted dcp  a non gaap financial measure  to the comparable gaap financial measure  dcp 
dcp is calculated by dividing the amount of reserve for claims and other settlements claims reserve by health plan services cost health plan costs during the year and multiplying that amount by the number of days in the year 
the following table presents an adjusted dcp metric which subtracts capitation  provider and other claim settlements and mapd and stand alone pdp payables costs from the claims reserve and health plan costs 
management believes that adjusted dcp provides useful information to investors because the adjusted dcp calculation excludes from both claims reserve and health plan costs amounts related to health care costs for which no or minimal reserves are maintained 
therefore  management believes that adjusted dcp may present a more accurate reflection of dcp calculated from claims based reserves than does gaap dcp  which includes such costs 
this non gaap financial information should be considered in addition to  not as a substitute for  financial information prepared in accordance with gaap 
you are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis 
in evaluating the adjusted amounts  you should be aware that we have incurred expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in the current presentation and we may incur them again in the future 
our presentation of the adjusted amounts should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items

table of contents income tax provision our income tax expense and the effective income tax rate for the years ended december   and are as follows dollars in millions income tax expense effective income tax rate the effective income tax rate differs from the statutory federal tax rate of for the year ended december  due primarily to state income taxes  tax exempt investment income  and most significantly due to the effect of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets established as a result of the decision rendered in in the amcareco litigation see consolidated results for additional information regarding the amcareco litigation 
the effective income tax rate differs from the statutory federal tax rate of for the year ended december  due primarily to state and local income taxes 
the effective income tax rate differs from the statutory federal tax rate of for the year ended december  due primarily to nondeductible goodwill impairment and the tax benefit associated with the northeast sale 
the effective income tax rate in is an inverse ratio to the pretax loss 
in  we reported a tax expense associated with a pretax loss because a significant portion of the loss on sale of our northeast health plan subsidiaries and the associated goodwill impairment is nondeductible for tax reporting purposes

our operating results for the year ended december  included million in pretax costs relating to our operations strategy and reductions from litigation reserve true ups 
in  we recorded a million pretax asset impairment charge as a result of entering into the stock purchase agreement in connection with the northeast sale 
liquidity and capital resources market and economic conditions the current state of the global economy and market conditions continue to be challenging with relatively high levels of unemployment  diminished business and consumer confidence  and volatility in both us and international capital and credit markets 
market conditions could limit our ability to timely replace maturing liabilities  or otherwise access capital markets for liquidity needs  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  if our customer base experiences cash flow problems and other financial difficulties  it could  in turn  adversely impact membership in our plans 
for example  our customers may modify  delay or cancel plans to purchase our products  may reduce the number of individuals to whom they provide coverage  or may make changes in the mix or products purchased from us 
in addition  if our customers experience financial issues  they may not be able to pay  or may delay payment of  accounts receivable that are owed to us 
further  our customers or potential customers may force us to compete more vigorously on factors such as price and service to retain or obtain their business 
a significant decline in membership in our plans and the inability of current and or potential customers to pay their premiums as a result of unfavorable conditions may adversely affect our business  including our revenues  profitability and cash flow 
cash and investments as of december   the fair value of the investment securities available for sale was billion  which includes both current and noncurrent investments 
noncurrent investments were million  or less than of the total investments available for sale as of december  we hold high quality fixed income securities primarily comprised of corporate bonds  mortgage backed bonds and municipal bonds 
we evaluate and determine the classification of our investments based on management s intent 
we also closely monitor the fair values of our investment holdings and regularly evaluate them for other than temporary impairments 
our cash flow from investing activities is primarily impacted by the sales  maturities and purchases of our available for sale investment securities and restricted investments 
our investment objective is to maintain safety and preservation of principal by investing in a diversified mix of high quality fixed income securities  substantially all of which are investment grade  while maintaining liquidity in each portfolio sufficient to meet our cash flow requirements and attaining an expected total return on invested funds 
our investment holdings are currently comprised of investment grade securities with an average rating of aa and aa as rated by s p and or moody s  respectively 
at this time  there is no indication of default on interest and or principal payments under our holdings 
we have the ability and current intent to hold to recovery all securities with an unrealized loss position 
as of december   our investment portfolio includes million  or of our portfolio holdings  of mortgage backed and asset backed securities 
the majority of our mortgage backed securities are fannie mae  freddie mac and ginnie mae issues  and the average rating of our entire asset backed securities is aa aa however  any failure by fannie mae or freddie mac to honor the obligations under the securities they have issued or guaranteed could cause a significant decline in the value or cash flow of our mortgage backed securities 
our investment portfolio also included million  or of 
table of contents our portfolio holdings of obligations of state and other political subdivisions and million  or of our portfolio holdings of corporate debt securities as of december  such amount includes noncurrent corporate debt securities of million 
we had gross unrealized losses of million as of december   and million as of december  included in the gross unrealized losses as of december  and december  are million and million  respectively  related to noncurrent investments available for sale 
we believe that these impairments are temporary and we do not intend to sell these investments 
it is not likely that we will be required to sell any security in an unrealized loss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis 
given the current market conditions and the significant judgments involved  there is a continuing risk that further declines in fair value may occur and additional material other than temporary impairments may be recorded in future periods 
no impairment was recognized during the years ended december  or liquidity we believe that expected cash flow from operating activities  any existing cash reserves and other working capital and lines of credit are adequate to allow us to fund existing obligations  repurchase shares under our stock repurchase program  introduce new products and services  enter into new lines of business and continue to operate and develop health care related businesses at least for the next twelve months 
we regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations and commitments  for acquisitions and other strategic transactions and for business expansion opportunities 
we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes  either through issuance of debt or equity  the sale of investment securities or otherwise  as appropriate 
based on the composition and quality of our investment portfolio  our expected ability to liquidate our investment portfolio as needed  and our expected operating and financing cash flows  we do not anticipate any liquidity constraints as a result of the current credit environment 
however  continued turbulence in us and international markets and certain costs associated with the implementation of health care reform legislation could adversely affect our liquidity 
our cash flow from operating activities is impacted by  among other things  the timing of collections on our amounts receivable from state and federal governments and agencies 
our receivable from cms related to our medicare business was million as of december  and million as of december  the receivable from dhcs related to our california medicaid business was million as of december  and million as of december  our receivable from the dod relating to our current and prior contracts for the tricare north region were million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
the timing of collection of such receivables is impacted by government audit and can extend for periods beyond a year

year ended december  compared to year ended december  net cash provided by investing activities increased by million compared to the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to a million increase in net sales and maturities of investments in available for sale securities and by an million increase in cash received from united for additional consideration related to the northeast sale  partially offset by a million increase in purchases of property and equipment 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net cash used in investing activities increased by million compared to the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to a million increase in net purchases of investments in available for sale securities  partially offset by a million increase in cash related to the northeast sale comprised of million received from united for additional sale consideration and approximately million net cash used in the northeast sale in 
financing activities year ended december  compared to year ended december  net cash used in financing activities increased by million primarily due to a million increase in share repurchases  a million increase in customer funds administered  a million decrease in checks outstanding net of deposits and million in debt issuance costs  partially offset by a million increase in net borrowings under our revolving credit facility  a million decrease in amounts paid under our amortizing financing facility due to the payoff of that facility in june and a million increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchases

statutory capital requirements certain of our subsidiaries must comply with minimum capital and surplus requirements under applicable state laws and regulations  and must have adequate reserves for claims 
management believes that as of december   all of our active health plans and insurance subsidiaries met their respective regulatory requirements relating to maintenance of minimum capital standards  surplus requirements and adequate reserves for claims in all material respects 
by law  regulation and governmental policy  our health plan and insurance subsidiaries  which we refer to as our regulated subsidiaries  are required to maintain minimum levels of statutory net worth 
the minimum statutory net worth requirements differ by state and are generally based on balances established by statute  a percentage of annualized premium revenue  a percentage of annualized health care costs  or risk based capital rbc or tangible net equity tne requirements 
the rbc requirements are based on guidelines established by the national association of insurance commissioners 
the rbc formula  which calculates asset risk  underwriting risk  credit risk  business risk and other factors  generates the authorized control level acl  which represents the minimum amount of net worth believed to be required to support the regulated entity s business 
for states in which the rbc requirements have been adopted  the regulated entity typically must maintain the greater of the company action level rbc  calculated as of the acl  or the minimum statutory net worth requirement calculated pursuant to pre rbc guidelines 
because our regulated subsidiaries are also subject to their state regulators overall oversight authority  some of our subsidiaries are required to 
table of contents maintain minimum capital and surplus in excess of the rbc requirement  even though rbc has been adopted in their states of domicile 
we generally manage our aggregate regulated subsidiary capital at approximately of acl  although rbc standards are not yet applicable to all of our regulated subsidiaries 
under the california knox keene health care service plan act of  as amended knox keene  certain california subsidiaries must comply with tne requirements 
under these knox keene tne requirements  actual net worth less unsecured receivables and intangible assets must be more than the greater of i a fixed minimum amount  ii a minimum amount based on premiums or iii a minimum amount based on health care expenditures  excluding capitated amounts 
in addition  certain california subsidiaries have made certain undertakings to the department of managed health care to restrict dividends and loans to affiliates  to the extent that the payment of such would reduce such entities tne below of the minimum requirement  or reduce the cash to claims ratio below at december   all of the subsidiaries subject to the tne requirements and the undertakings to the department of managed health care exceeded the minimum requirements 
as necessary  we make contributions to and issue standby letters of credit on behalf of our subsidiaries to meet rbc or other statutory capital requirements under state laws and regulations 
during the year ended december   we made capital contributions of million to a subsidiary to maintain our target rbc at approximately of acl 
health net  inc made no capital contributions to any of our subsidiaries to meet rbc or other statutory capital requirements under state laws and regulations thereafter through february  legislation has been or may be enacted in certain states in which our subsidiaries operate imposing substantially increased minimum capital and or statutory deposit requirements for hmos in such states 
such statutory deposits may only be drawn upon under limited circumstances relating to the protection of policyholders 
as a result of the above requirements and other regulatory requirements  certain subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to make dividend payments  loans or other transfers of cash to their parent companies 
such restrictions  unless amended or waived or unless regulatory approval is granted  limit the use of any cash generated by these subsidiaries to pay our obligations 
the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid by our insurance company subsidiaries without prior approval of the applicable state insurance departments is subject to restrictions relating to statutory surplus  statutory income and unassigned surplus

under the terms of the agreement  cognizant will  among other things  provide us with claims adjudication  adjustment  audit and process improvement services 
the remaining term of this contract is approximately three years  and the total estimated future commitments under the agreement are approximately million 
we have excluded from the table above amounts already recorded in our current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  we have also excluded from the table above various contracts we have entered into with our health care providers  health care facilities  the federal government and other contracts that we have entered into for the purpose of providing health care services 
we have excluded those contracts that allow for cancellation without significant penalty  obligations that are contingent upon achieving certain goals and contracts for goods and services that are fulfilled by vendors within a short time horizon and within the normal course of business 

table of contents the future contractual obligations in the contractual obligations table are estimated based on information currently available

see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our letters of credit 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
principal areas requiring the use of estimates include revenue recognition  health care costs  including ibnr amounts  reserves for contingent liabilities  amounts receivable or payable under government contracts  goodwill and other intangible assets  recoverability of long lived assets and investments  and income taxes 
accordingly  we consider accounting policies on these areas to be critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
a significant change in any one of these amounts may have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
a more detailed description of the significant accounting policies that we use in preparing our financial statements is included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements  which are included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
health plan services health plan services premium revenues include hmo  pos and ppo premiums from employer groups and individuals and from medicare recipients who have purchased supplemental benefit coverage for which premiums are based on a predetermined prepaid fee  medicaid revenues based on multi year contracts to provide care to medicaid recipients  and revenue under medicare risk contracts including part d to provide care and services to enrolled medicare recipients 
revenue is recognized in the month in which the related enrollees are entitled to health care services 
premiums collected in advance of the month in which enrollees are entitled to health care services are recorded as unearned premiums 
approximately   and in  and  respectively  of our health plan services premium revenues were generated under medicare and medicaid medi cal contracts 
these revenues are subject to audit and retroactive adjustment by the respective fiscal intermediaries 
laws and regulations governing these programs  including proposed risk adjustment data validation radv audit and enacted the patient protection and affordable care act  are extremely complex and subject to interpretation 
as a result  there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates will change by a material amount 
our medicare contracts are with cms 
cms deploys a risk adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity and certain demographic factors 
the cms risk adjustment model pays more for members whose medical history would indicate that they are expected to have higher medical costs 
under this risk adjustment methodology  cms calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis data from hospital inpatient  hospital outpatient and physician treatment settings 
we and the health care providers collect  compile and submit the necessary and available diagnosis data to cms within prescribed deadlines 
we estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the diagnosis data submitted and expected to be submitted to cms 
on a monthly basis  we estimate the amount of uncollectible receivables to reflect allowances for doubtful accounts 
the allowances for doubtful accounts are estimated based on the creditworthiness of our customers  our 
table of contents historical collection rates and the age of our unpaid balances 
during this process  we also assess the recoverability of the receivables  and an allowance is recorded based upon their net realizable value 
those receivables that are deemed to be uncollectible  such as receivables from bankrupt employer groups  are fully written off against their corresponding asset account  with a debit to the allowance to the extent such an allowance was previously recorded 
reserves for claims and other settlements include reserves for claims ibnr claims and received but unprocessed claims  and other liabilities including capitation payable  shared risk settlements  provider disputes  provider incentives and other reserves for our western region operations reporting segment 
as of december   of reserves for claims and other settlements were attributed to claims reserves 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of changes in the reserve for claims 
we estimate the amount of our reserves for claims primarily by using standard actuarial developmental methodologies 
this method is also known as the chain ladder or completion factor method 
the developmental method estimates reserves for claims based upon the historical lag between the month when services are rendered and the month claims are paid while taking into consideration  among other things  expected medical cost inflation  seasonal patterns  product mix  benefit plan changes and changes in membership 
a key component of the developmental method is the completion factor  which is a measure of how complete the claims paid to date are relative to the estimate of the claims for services rendered for a given period 
while the completion factors are reliable and robust for older service periods  they are more volatile and less reliable for more recent periods since a large portion of health care claims are not submitted to us until several months after services have been rendered 
accordingly  for the most recent months  the incurred claims are estimated from a trend analysis based on per member per month claims trends developed from the experience in preceding months 
this method is applied consistently year over year while assumptions may be adjusted to reflect changes in medical cost inflation  seasonal patterns  product mix  benefit plan changes and changes in membership 
an extensive degree of actuarial judgment is used in this estimation process  considerable variability is inherent in such estimates  and the estimates are highly sensitive to changes in medical claims submission and payment patterns and medical cost trends 
as such  the completion factors and the claims per member per month trend factor are the most significant factors used in estimating our reserves for claims 
since a large portion of the reserves for claims is attributed to the most recent months  the estimated reserves for claims are highly sensitive to these factors 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by these factors completion factor a percentage point increase decrease in factor western region operations health plan services decrease increase in reserves for claims million million million million medical cost trend b percentage point increase decrease in factor western region operations health plan services increase decrease in reserves for claims million million million million 
table of contents a impact due to change in completion factor for the most recent three months 
completion factors indicate how complete claims paid to date are in relation to the estimate of total claims for a given period 
therefore  an increase in completion factor percent results in a decrease in the remaining estimated reserves for claims 
b impact due to change in annualized medical cost trend used to estimate the per member per month cost for the most recent three months 
other relevant factors include exceptional situations that might require judgmental adjustments in setting the reserves for claims  such as system conversions  processing interruptions or changes  environmental changes or other factors 
all of these factors are used in estimating reserves for claims and are important to our reserve methodology in trending the claims per member per month for purposes of estimating the reserves for the most recent months 
in developing our best estimate of reserves for claims  we consistently apply the principles and methodology described above from year to year  while also giving due consideration to the potential variability of these factors 
because reserves for claims include various actuarially developed estimates  our actual health care services expense may be more or less than our previously developed estimates 
claims processing expenses are also accrued based on an estimate of expenses necessary to process such claims 
such reserves are continually monitored and reviewed  with any adjustments reflected in current operations 
we assess the profitability of contracts for providing health care services when operating results or forecasts indicate probable future losses 
significant factors that can lead to a change in our profitability estimates include premium yield and health care cost trend assumptions  risk share terms and non performance of a provider under a capitated agreement resulting in membership reverting to fee for service arrangements with other providers 
contracts are grouped in a manner consistent with the method of determining premium rates 
losses are determined by comparing anticipated premiums to estimates for the total of health care related costs less reinsurance recoveries  if any  and the cost of maintaining the contracts 
losses  if any  are recognized in the period the losses are determined and are classified as health plan services 
we held a premium deficiency reserve of million as of december  government contracts on april   we began delivering administrative services under the t contract for the tricare north region 
we were the managed care contractor for the dod s previous tricare contract in the north region  which ended on march  under the t contract for the tricare north region  we provide various types of administrative services  including provider network management  referral management  medical management  disease management  enrollment  customer service  clinical support service  and claims processing 
we also provide assistance in the transition into and out of the t contract 
these services are structured as cost reimbursement arrangements plus fees received in the form of fixed prices  fixed unit prices  and contingent fees and payments based on various incentives and penalties 
in accordance with gaap  we evaluate  at the inception of the contract and as services are delivered  all deliverables in the service arrangement to determine whether they represent separate units of accounting 
the delivered items are considered separate units of accounting if the delivered items have value to the customer on a standalone basis ie  they are sold separately by any vendor and no general right of return exists relative to the delivered item 
while we identified two separate units of accounting within the t contract  no determination of estimated selling price was performed because both units of accounting are performed ratably over the option periods and  accordingly  the same methodology of revenue recognition applies to both units of accounting 
therefore  we recognize revenue related to administrative services on a straight line basis over the option period  when the fees become fixed and determinable 

table of contents the contract includes various performance based incentives and penalties 
for each of the incentives or penalties  we adjust revenue accordingly based on the amount that we have earned or incurred at each interim date and are legally entitled to in the event of a contract termination 
revenues and expenses associated with the t contract are reported as part of government contracts revenues and government contracts expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and included in the government contracts reportable segment 
some of the amounts receivable under government contracts are comprised primarily of contractually defined billings  accrued contract incentives under the terms of the contract and change orders for services not originally specified in the contracts 
change orders arise because the government often directs us to implement changes to our contracts before the scope and or value is defined or negotiated 
we start to incur costs immediately  before we have proposed a price to the government 
in these situations  we make no attempt to estimate and record revenue  and we will record the costs and the appropriate value for revenue  using our best estimate of what will ultimately be negotiated 
in the normal course of contracting with the federal government  we may make claims for contract and price adjustments arising from cost overruns against the government 
we recognize such claims when the amounts become determinable  supportable and the collectability is reasonably assured 
reserves for contingent liabilities in the course of our operations  we are involved on a routine basis in various disputes with members  health care providers  and other entities  as well as audits by government agencies and elected officials that relate to our services and or business practices that expose us to potential losses 
we recognize an estimated loss  which may represent damages  assessment of regulatory fines or penalties  settlement costs  future legal expenses or a combination of the foregoing  as appropriate  from such loss contingencies when it is both probable that a loss will be incurred and that the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
our loss estimates are based in part on an analysis of potential results  the stage of the proceedings  consultation with outside counsel and any other relevant information available 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets arise primarily as a result of various business acquisitions and consist of identifiable intangible assets acquired and the excess of the cost of the acquisitions over the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed goodwill 
identifiable intangible assets primarily consist of the value of employer group contracts  provider networks and customer relationships  which are all subject to amortization 
we perform our annual impairment test on our recorded goodwill as of june or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that we might not recover the carrying value of these assets for each of our reporting units 
we performed our annual impairment test on our goodwill and other intangible assets as of june  for our western region operations reporting unit  and no impairment was identified 
we performed a two step impairment test to determine the existence of impairment and the amount of the impairment 
in the first step  we compared the fair values to the related carrying values and concluded that the carrying value of the western region operations was not impaired 
as a result  the second step was not performed 
the ratio of the fair value of our western region operations to its carrying value was approximately 
we also re evaluated the useful lives of our other intangible assets and determined that the current estimated useful lives were properly reflected 
during the three months ended june   we performed our annual impairment test and determined that the implied value of the northeast operations reporting unit s goodwill was zero 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of million for the total carrying value of the northeast operations goodwill during the three months ended june 
table of contents recoverability of long lived assets and investments we periodically assess the recoverability of our long lived assets including property and equipment and other long term assets and investments where events and changes in circumstances would indicate that we might not recover the carrying value as follows long lived assets held and used we test long lived assets or asset groups for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
circumstances which could trigger a review include  but are not limited to significant decreases in the market price of the asset  significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors  current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset and current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its estimated useful life 
if we identify an indicator of impairment  we assess recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and the eventual disposal of the asset 
an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount is not recoverable and is measured as the excess of carrying value over fair value 
during the year ended december   we recorded million in impairment charges to general and administrative expenses primarily for internally developed software 
income taxes we record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated by applying enacted tax rates and laws to taxable years in which such differences are expected to reverse 
we establish a valuation allowance in accordance with the provisions of the income taxes topic of financial accounting standards board fasb codification 
we continually review the adequacy of the valuation allowance and recognize the benefits from our deferred tax assets only when an analysis of both positive and negative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that the benefits will be realized 
we file tax returns in many tax jurisdictions 
often  application of tax rules within the various jurisdictions is subject to differing interpretation 
despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe that it is probable certain positions will be challenged by taxing authorities  and we may not prevail on the positions as filed 
accordingly  we maintain a liability for the estimated amount of contingent tax challenges by taxing authorities upon examination 
we analyze the amount at which each tax position meets a more likely than not standard for sustainability upon examination by taxing authorities 
only tax benefit amounts meeting or exceeding this standard will be reflected in tax provision expense and deferred tax asset balances 
any differences between the amounts of tax benefits reported on tax returns and tax benefits reported in the financial statements is recorded in a liability for unrecognized tax benefits 
the liability for unrecognized tax benefits is reported separately from deferred tax assets and liabilities and classified as current or noncurrent based upon the expected period of payment 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate and market risk primarily due to our investing and borrowing activities 
market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in the value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates and or market conditions and in equity prices 
interest rate risk is a consequence of maintaining variable interest rate earning investments and fixed rate liabilities or fixed income investments and variable rate liabilities 
we are exposed to interest rate risks arising 
table of contents from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates  prepayment speeds and or the shape and slope of the yield curve 
in addition  we are exposed to the risk of loss related to changes in credit spreads 
credit spread risk arises from the potential changes in an issuer s credit rating or credit perception that may affect the value of financial instruments 
we attempt to manage the interest rate risks related to our investment portfolios by actively managing the asset duration of our investment portfolios 
the overall goal for the investment portfolios is to provide a source of liquidity and support the ongoing operations of our business units 
our philosophy is to actively manage assets to maximize total return over a multiple year time horizon  subject to appropriate levels of risk 
each business unit has additional requirements with respect to liquidity  current income and contribution to surplus 
we manage these risks by setting risk tolerances  targeting asset class allocations  diversifying among assets and asset characteristics  and using performance measurement and reporting 
we use a value at risk var model  which follows a variance co variance methodology  to assess the market risk for our investment portfolio 
var is a method of assessing investment risk that uses standard statistical techniques to measure the worst expected loss in the portfolio over an assumed portfolio disposition period under normal market conditions 
the determination is made at a given statistical confidence level 
we assumed a portfolio disposition period of days with a confidence level of for the computation of var for the computation further assumes that the distribution of returns is normal 
based on such methodology and assumptions  the computed var was approximately million as of december  our calculated var exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that could be recognized on our investment portfolios assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and are not necessarily indicative of actual results which may occur 
it does not represent the maximum possible loss nor any expected loss that may occur  since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated  based upon actual fluctuations in market rates  operating exposures  and the timing thereof  and changes in our investment portfolios during the year 
except for those securities held by trustees or regulatory agencies see note to our consolidated financial statements  all of our investment securities are designated as available for sale assets 
as such  they are reflected at their estimated fair value  with the difference between cost and estimated fair value reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax  a component of stockholders equity see note to the consolidated financial statements 
all of our investment securities are fixed income securities 
approximately of our available for sale investment securities are asset backed securities abs mortgage backed securities mbs 
approximately of the abs mbs are agency securities 
therefore  we believe that our exposure to credit related market value risk for our mbs is limited 
generally  in a rising interest rate environment  the estimated fair value of fixed income securities would be expected to decrease  conversely  in a decreasing interest rate environment  the estimated fair value of fixed income securities would be expected to increase 
however  these securities may be negatively impacted by illiquidity in the market 
the recent disruptions in the credit markets have negatively impacted the liquidity of investments 
however  such disruptions did not have a material impact to the liquidity of our investments 
a worsening of credit market function or sustained market downturns could have negative effects on the liquidity and value of our investment assets 
borrowings under our revolving credit facility  which totaled million as of december   are subject to variable interest rates 
for additional information regarding our revolving credit facility  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
our floating rate borrowings  if any  are presumed to have equal book and fair values because the interest rates paid on these borrowings  if any  are based on prevailing market rates 
the fair value of our fixed rate borrowing  which consists of only our senior notes  as of december  was approximately million  which was based on quoted market prices 
where quoted market prices 
table of contents were not readily available  fair values were estimated using valuation methodologies based on available and observable market information 
such valuation methodologies include reviewing the value ascribed to the most recent financing  comparing the security with securities of publicly traded companies in a similar line of business  and reviewing the underlying financial performance including estimating discounted cash flows 
the following table presents the expected cash outflows relating to market risk sensitive debt obligations as of december  these cash outflows include expected principal and interest payments consistent with the terms of the outstanding debt as of december  thereafter total amounts in millions fixed rate borrowing principal interest cash outflow on fixed rate borrowing variable rate borrowing principal interest cash outflow on variable rate borrowing total cash outflow on borrowings
