item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this section includes a discussion of our operations for the three years ended august   and the following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our results of operations and financial condition 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto in part ii  item of this report and the selected financial data contained in part ii  item of this report 
business we are one of the nation s largest recyclers of ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal  a leading recycler of used and salvaged vehicles and a manufacturer of finished steel products 
we operate in three reporting segments the metals recycling business mrb  the auto parts business apb and the steel manufacturing business smb which collectively provide an end of life cycle solution for a variety of products through our integrated businesses 
we use operating income loss to measure our segment performance 
restructuring charges are not allocated to the segment operating income loss because we do not include this information in our measurement of the segments performance 
corporate expense consists primarily of unallocated expense for management and administrative services that benefit all three reporting segments 
as a result of this unallocated expense  the operating income loss of each reporting segment does not reflect the operating income loss the reporting segment would report as a stand alone business 
for further information regarding our reporting segments  including financial information about geographic areas  see note segment information in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
mrb buys  collects  processes  recycles  sells and brokers ferrous scrap metal containing iron to foreign and domestic steel producers  including smb  and nonferrous scrap metal not containing iron to both foreign and domestic markets 
mrb processes mixed and large pieces of scrap metal into smaller pieces by crushing  sorting  shearing  shredding and torching  resulting in scrap metal pieces of a size  density and metal content required by customers to meet their production needs 
apb procures used and salvaged vehicles and sells serviceable used auto parts from these vehicles through its self service auto parts stores 
the remaining portions of the vehicles  primarily autobodies and major parts containing ferrous and nonferrous materials  are sold to metal recyclers  including mrb where geographically feasible 
smb operates a steel mini mill that produces a wide range of finished steel products 
mrb is the sole supplier for smb s scrap metal requirements  which smb purchases at rates that approximate export market prices for shipments from the west coast of the us smb uses its mini mill near portland  oregon to melt recycled metal and other raw materials to produce finished steel products 
smb also maintains a mill depot in southern california 
our results of operations depend in large part on the demand and prices for recycled metal in foreign and domestic markets and on the supply of raw materials  including end of life vehicles  available to be processed at our facilities 
our deep water port facilities on both the east and west coasts of the us in everett  massachusetts  providence  rhode island  oakland  california  portland  oregon  and tacoma  washington and access to public deep water port facilities in kapolei  hawaii and salinas  puerto rico allow us to efficiently meet the global demand for ferrous recycled metal by shipping bulk cargoes to steel manufacturers located in europe  asia  central america and africa 
our exports of nonferrous processed recycled metal are shipped in containers through various public docks to specialty steelmakers  foundries  aluminum sheet and ingot manufacturers  copper refineries and smelters  brass and bronze ingot manufacturers and wire and cable producers globally 
we also transport both ferrous and nonferrous metals by truck and rail in order to transfer scrap metal between our facilities for further processing  to load shipments at our export facilities and to meet regional domestic demand 
key economic factors and trends affecting the industries in which we operate we sell recycled metals to the global steel industry for the production of finished steel 
our financial results largely depend on supply of raw materials in the us and demand for recycled metal in foreign and domestic markets and for finished steel products in the western us fluctuating or volatile supply and demand conditions affect market prices for and volumes of recycled ferrous and nonferrous metal in global markets and for steel products in the western us and can have a significant impact on the results of operations for all three reporting segments 
in fiscal  our markets were significantly impacted by the european sovereign debt crisis which escalated in the fall of and led to a slowdown of economic activity globally 
macroeconomic uncertainty resulted in deteriorating market conditions for global steel manufacturers and volatile pricing swings with an overall downward trend in commodity prices and export selling prices of recycled materials 
the persistently low economic growth in the us contributed to increasing market pressure on scrap flows in our mrb and apb domestic supply markets and margin compression 
in addition  a relatively stronger us dollar value increased competitive pressure on mrb s export activity 
schnitzer steel industries  inc form k 
table of contents strategic factors as we continue to closely monitor economic conditions  we remain focused on the following core strategies to meet our business objectives use of our seven deep water ports to access customers directly around the world and to meet demand wherever it is greatest  growth through acquisitions in existing and new geographic regions that generate attractive returns  continued investment in and benefit from technologies and process improvements which increase the separation and recovery of recycled materials from our shredding process  and increased internal synergies and continuous improvement initiatives which further integrate our operations  streamline corporate functions  reduce organizational layers and drive significant cost savings 
we highly value the strategic synergies within our integrated operations 
apb is a key supplier to mrb  and we opportunistically look to enhance the geographic proximity of operations within the two businesses 
in fiscal  we acquired substantially all of the assets of two metals recycling businesses in canada  with a total of twelve metals collection and processing facilities  which marked mrb s first expansion into canada 
in fiscal  we acquired substantially all of the assets of an additional metals recycling business in canada 
apb has three facilities in western canada that are able to supply these new mrb facilities in addition to shipping to our tacoma  wa metals recycling facility 
also in fiscal  we acquired substantially all of the assets of a used auto parts business with three stores in seattle  wa  expanding apb s presence in the northwestern us mrb has an export facility in tacoma  wa  which benefits from the synergies of this enhanced access to supply 
both mrb and apb also have a significant presence in northern california  and during fiscal we implemented further enhancements to the synergies between these businesses by integrating certain operational processes 
executive overview of financial results we generated revenues of billion in fiscal  a decrease of from the billion of consolidated revenues in the prior year 
the decrease was primarily due to lower volumes of ferrous sales as a result of soft global demand for recycled metal and constrained supply of raw materials 
operating income for fiscal decreased by million  or  to million  including restructuring charges of million  when compared with the prior year due to the deterioration in market conditions caused mainly by the escalation in the european sovereign debt crisis in the fall of this led to a slowdown of economic activity and resulted in weakening global demand and periods of volatile prices with an overall downward trend in export selling prices for recycled metals 
this  combined with the constrained supply of raw materials and the adverse effect of average inventory costing on cost of goods sold during periods of sharp declines in selling prices that occurred in fiscal  led to a compression in operating margins 
this contrasted with the prior fiscal year  which benefited from a stronger market environment and rising prices for recycled metals 
net income attributable to ssi decreased by million  or  to million when compared with the prior year 
diluted net income attributable to ssi was per share for fiscal  including the adverse effect of per share related to restructuring charges  compared to diluted net income attributable to ssi of per share in fiscal

corporate expense consists primarily of unallocated expenses for services that benefit all three business segments 
as a consequence of this unallocated expense  the operating income of each segment does not reflect the operating income the segment would report as a stand alone business 
the joint ventures sell recycled ferrous metal to mrb and then subsequently to smb at rates per ton that approximate west coast us export market prices 
consequently  these intercompany revenues produce intercompany operating income loss  which is not recognized until the finished products are sold to third parties  therefore  intercompany profit is eliminated while the products remain in inventory

table of contents revenues fiscal compared with fiscal consolidated revenues for fiscal decreased primarily due to lower sales volumes of ferrous scrap metal as a result of soft global demand and constrained supply of raw materials 
fiscal compared with fiscal consolidated revenues for fiscal increased for all reporting segments primarily due to higher average net selling prices and higher sales volumes resulting from stronger worldwide demand from export markets as well as recovering domestic demand for scrap and recycled metal  increased availability of raw materials  including improved recovery through enhanced processing technologies 
incremental revenues from third party sales generated by fiscal acquisitions were million 
operating income fiscal compared with fiscal consolidated operating income decreased primarily due to the market deterioration that began in the first quarter of fiscal caused mainly by the escalation in the european sovereign debt crisis  which  together with slowing economic growth  resulted in weakening global demand and periods of volatile prices with an overall downward trend in export selling prices for recycled metals 
this  combined with the constrained supply of raw materials and the adverse effect of average inventory costing on cost of goods sold during periods of sharp declines in selling prices that occurred in fiscal  led to a compression in operating margins which contrasted with the prior fiscal year  which benefited from a stronger market environment and rising prices for recycled metals 
included in consolidated operating income for fiscal was selling  general and administrative sg a expense of million  which approximated the prior fiscal year levels 
included in sg a expense was a decrease in incentive compensation expenses of million resulting from lower financial performance  offset by higher costs primarily associated with incremental operating expenses related to fiscal acquisitions of million and the absence in fiscal year of million of favorable customer contract settlements recorded in fiscal consolidated operating income in fiscal included restructuring charges of million  consisting of severance  contract termination and other exit costs in connection with initiatives designed to extract greater synergies from the significant acquisitions and technology investments made in recent years  achieve further integration between mrb and apb  realign our organization to support future growth and decrease operating expenses by streamlining functions and reducing organizational layers 
these initiatives are expected to lower annual operating costs by million  comprising approximately million of selling  general and administrative expense and million of cost of goods sold  and be substantially complete by the end of fiscal we expect that total pre tax charges pursuant to these restructuring initiatives will be approximately million 
approximately half of the remaining million of total restructuring charges is expected to be incurred in the first quarter of fiscal  with the balance expected to be incurred by the end of fiscal we expect that the vast majority of the restructuring charges will require us to make cash payments

interest expense interest expense was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase from fiscal to fiscal was due to increased average borrowings primarily related to our acquisitions in fiscal and higher average interest rates under our bank credit facilities compared to the prior year 
the increase from fiscal to fiscal was the result of higher outstanding debt due to acquisitions and higher average interest rates under our bank credit facilities

fiscal compared with fiscal our effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to for fiscal in fiscal  the effective tax rate differed from the us federal statutory rate of primarily due to state tax benefits and research and development credits  partially offset by the adverse impact of foreign subsidiaries results taxed at different tax rates 
in fiscal  the effective tax rate benefited from certain adjustments recorded in the period  including a recognition of research and development credits  a reduction in a reserve for unrecognized state income tax benefits and the correction of a prior period error that resulted in an increase to net income of million 
fiscal compared with fiscal our effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to for fiscal the effective tax rate differed from the us federal statutory rate of  primarily due to the lower tax rate for foreign income and domestic production activities deductions 
the fiscal effective tax rate also benefited from certain adjustments recorded in the period  including a recognition of research and development credits and a reduction in a reserve for unrecognized state income tax benefits 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded an adjustment to correct an error that originated in a prior period pertaining to deferred tax liabilities related to our investment in a subsidiary 
the correction of this error resulted in a reduction of income tax expense and an increase to net income of million for the year ended august  see note income taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report for further discussion

fiscal compared with fiscal revenues the decrease in ferrous revenues was primarily due to lower sales volumes due to soft global demand and constrained supply of raw materials 
ferrous sales volumes decreased thousand long tons  or  to  thousand long tons compared to the prior year 
despite sharp but temporary periods of pricing declines that occurred in the first and third quarters of fiscal  average net selling prices decreased per long ton  or less than  to per long ton compared to the prior year  with a decrease in export prices being substantially offset by an increase in domestic prices 
the decrease in nonferrous revenues was driven by a decrease in average net selling prices as a result of weak market conditions

segment operating income operating income for fiscal decreased by million  or  compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the significant market deterioration that began in the first quarter of fiscal caused mainly by the escalation in the european sovereign debt crisis  which resulted in weakening global demand and volatile pricing trends 
during fiscal global selling prices for recycled metals experienced periods of sharp declines and while selling prices subsequently recovered to a certain extent from their lows  the overall selling price environment remained on a downward trend due to softening global demand 
this  combined with the constrained supply of raw materials and the adverse effect of average inventory costing on cost of goods sold during periods of sharp declines in selling prices that occurred in fiscal  led to a compression in operating margins which contrasted with the prior fiscal year  which benefited from a stronger market environment and rising prices for recycled metals 
in addition  operating income for fiscal reflected an increase in sg a expense by million  or  compared to the prior year primarily due to the absence of a benefit of million from favorable customer contract settlements recognized in fiscal and an increase of million for the operating expenses of fiscal acquisitions  partially offset by a reduction in incentive compensation expenses of million resulting from lower financial performance in fiscal and a decrease in expense related to environmental liabilities of million compared to the prior year 
fiscal compared with fiscal revenues the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to higher average net selling prices and higher sales volumes caused by increased demand  availability of raw materials and incremental volume from acquisitions 
the increase in ferrous revenues was primarily driven by higher average net selling prices and higher sales volumes 
the average net ferrous selling price increased per long ton during fiscal primarily due to stronger demand from export markets as well as gradually recovering domestic demand which drove increases in foreign and domestic selling prices 
ferrous sales volumes increased by million long tons driven by increased availability of raw materials  our focus on maximizing throughput  which is being accomplished through increased purchases of raw materials  increased production as a result of our investments in technology and continuous improvement programs  and incremental volume from acquisitions 
the increase in nonferrous revenues was driven by increases in both the average nonferrous net selling price and sales volumes 
the average net selling price increased per pound during fiscal primarily due to stronger demand and higher commodity prices 
in addition  nonferrous volumes sold increased million pounds for fiscal  reflecting stronger global market conditions  improved recovery of nonferrous materials processed through our enhanced shredding and sorting technologies  more nonferrous collection activity and incremental volume from acquisitions 
segment operating income the increase in operating income in fiscal was primarily due to higher average net selling prices and higher sales volumes for both ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal as a result of continuing strong export market conditions  increased availability of raw materials  increased yield from higher production and enhanced shredding and sorting technologies  and incremental operating income from acquisitions 
while we were able to increase the spread between selling prices and purchase prices  operating income as a percentage of revenues decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal  primarily due to the escalation in selling prices 
included in fiscal operating income for mrb was an increase in sg a expense of million compared to the prior year primarily due to a million increase in compensation expense as a result of increased headcount from new acquisitions and a million increase in expenses for professional and other third party services primarily related to transaction costs associated with acquisitions 
in fiscal  sg a expense was reduced by million for favorable customer contract settlements  which represented a million increase over the prior year

table of contents auto parts business for the year ended august  increase decrease in thousands vs vs revenues cost of goods sold selling  general and administrative expense segment operating income number of stores at period end cars purchased in thousands fiscal compared with fiscal revenues the decrease in revenues by million  or  was driven by lower average commodity prices and decreased car volumes  both of which adversely impacted sales of ferrous and nonferrous material compared to the prior year 
segment operating income operating income for fiscal decreased by million  or  due to the compression in operating margins caused primarily by slightly higher average vehicle purchases costs coupled with a decrease in average selling prices for ferrous and nonferrous material compared to the prior year 
the compression in operating margins was exacerbated by market volatility in an overall decreasing commodity price environment 
periods of temporary but sharp declines in commodity prices due to softening global demand led to purchase prices for end of life vehicles decreasing at a slower pace than average net selling prices in those periods  causing an adverse effect of average inventory costing on cost of goods sold 
in addition  operating income for fiscal reflected higher sg a expenses of million  or  primarily due to operating expenses related to fiscal acquisitions  increased legal expenses and higher advertising costs  which were partially offset by increased operational efficiencies and a reduction in incentive compensation expenses resulting from lower financial performance in fiscal fiscal compared with fiscal revenues the increase in revenues by million  or  was driven by higher commodity prices  increased car volumes  further enhancement of production operating efficiencies  and an increase in the number of self service store locations 
in fiscal  apb did not benefit from the cash for clunkers government stimulus program that increased sales volumes in the prior year 
segment operating income the increase in operating income for fiscal reflected the impact of higher commodity prices  increased volumes of ferrous and nonferrous material sales  and improved production operating efficiencies 
the decrease in operating income as a percentage of revenues from in fiscal to in fiscal reflected an increase in car purchasing costs which outpaced the increase in selling prices and an increase in sg a expense of million for fiscal  primarily due to a million increase in compensation expense as a result of additional headcount from acquisitions

the rise in the average selling price for finished steel products compared to the prior year was primarily driven by the impact on selling prices of increased average purchase costs of raw materials and by changes in the product mix towards higher valued products 
segment operating income loss smb generated an operating loss for fiscal of million  compared to operating income of million in the prior year  in a continuing weak market environment in our us west coast markets as a result of slow economic growth that has hampered recovery in construction spending 
the decrease in operating results compared to the prior year was primarily due to higher average raw material purchase prices and the adverse impact of unscheduled production downtime 
fiscal compared with fiscal revenues smb revenues increased primarily as a result of increased average selling prices for finished steel products  reflecting our ability to pass through higher purchase prices for scrap and other raw materials to end customers 
the increase in average selling prices for finished steel products was driven by increased scrap metal purchase prices in global markets as a result of improved worldwide demand and was partially offset by a decrease in the volume of finished steel products sold for fiscal due to continuing weak demand in our west coast markets as a result of slow economic growth that hampers construction spending recovery

we have been identified by the united states environmental protection agency epa as one of the potentially responsible parties prps that own or operate or formerly owned or operated sites which are part of or adjacent to the portland harbor superfund site the site 
a group of prps is conducting an investigation and study to identify and characterize the contamination at the site and develop alternative approaches to remediation of the contamination 
on march  the group submitted to the epa a draft feasibility study draft fs based on approximately ten years of work and million in costs classified as investigation related 
the draft fs identifies ten possible remedial alternatives which range in estimated cost from approximately million to million net present value for the least costly alternative to approximately billion to billion net present value for the most costly and estimates a range of two to years to implement the remedial work  depending on the selected alternative 
the draft fs does not determine who is responsible for remediation costs  define the precise cleanup boundaries or select remedies 
the draft fs is being reviewed  and may be subject to revisions prior to its approval  by the epa 
a final decision on the nature and extent of the required remediation will occur only after the epa has prepared a proposed plan for public review and issued a record of decision rod 
currently available information indicates that the epa does not expect to issue its final rod selecting a remedy for the site until at least because there has not been a determination of the total cost of the investigations  the remediation that will be required  the amount of natural resource damages or how the costs of the ongoing investigations and any remedy and natural resource damages will be allocated among the prps  we believe it is not reasonably possible to estimate the amount or range of costs which we are likely or reasonably possible to incur in connection with the site  although such costs could be material to our financial position  results of operations  future cash flows and liquidity 
any material liabilities recorded in the future related to the site could result in our failure to maintain compliance with certain covenants in our debt agreements 
significant cash outflows in the future related to the site could reduce the amounts available for borrowing that could otherwise be used for investment in capital expenditures  acquisitions  dividends and share repurchases

redeemable noncontrolling interest in march  we issued common stock of one of our subsidiaries to the noncontrolling interest holder of that subsidiary that is redeemable both at the option of the holder and upon the occurrence of an event that is not solely within our control 
under the terms of an agreement related to the acquisition  the noncontrolling interest holder has the right to require us to purchase its interest in our subsidiary for fair value 
the noncontrolling interest becomes redeemable within days after the later of i the third anniversary of the date of the acquisition and ii the date on which certain principals of the minority shareholder are no longer employed by the company 
the conditions for redemption of the noncontrolling interest had not been met as of august  if the interest were to be redeemed  we would be required to purchase all of such interest at fair value on the date of redemption 
as of august   the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest was million

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make certain judgments  estimates  and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain at the time the estimate is made  if different estimates reasonably could have been used  or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
we deem critical accounting policies to be those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters  actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies 
we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported

table of contents our critical accounting estimates include those related to goodwill  environmental costs  inventories  accounting for business combinations  revenue recognition and redeemable noncontrolling interest 
goodwill we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually during the second fiscal quarter and upon the occurrence of certain triggering events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate that the fair value of goodwill may be impaired 
impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component 
the company has determined that its reporting units for which goodwill has been allocated are equivalent to the company s operating segments  as all of the components of each segment have similar economic characteristics 
the goodwill impairment test follows a two step process 
in the first step  the fair value of a reporting unit is compared to its carrying value 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the impairment test is performed for purposes of measuring the impairment 
in the second step  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to determine an implied goodwill value 
this allocation is similar to a purchase price allocation 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill  an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
we estimate the fair value of the reporting units using an income approach based on the present value of expected future cash flows utilizing a market based weighted average cost of capital wacc determined separately for each reporting unit 
to estimate the present value of the cash flows that extend beyond the final year of the discounted cash flow model  we employ a terminal value technique  whereby we use estimated operating cash flows minus capital expenditures and adjust for changes in working capital requirements in the final year of the model  then discount it by the wacc to establish the terminal value 
the determination of fair value using the income approach requires judgment and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions about expected future cash flows derived from internal forecasts and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions 
critical assumptions primarily include revenue growth rates driven by future commodity prices and volume expectations  operating margins  capital expenditures  working capital requirements  tax rates  terminal growth rates and appropriate discount rates 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we identified the combination of the recent but significant decline of the company s market capitalization below the carrying value of its net assets  the persistent uncertainty around global macroeconomic conditions and the impact on our fiscal operating results of current challenging market conditions in our industry as a triggering event requiring an interim impairment test of goodwill 
for the apb reporting unit  the calculated fair value using the income approach substantially exceeded its carrying value 
for the mrb reporting unit with goodwill of million as of may   the calculated fair value exceeded the carrying value by approximately 
the projections used in the income approach for mrb took into consideration the current weak market conditions  including the challenging macroeconomic indicators in the markets in which we operate and those where our customers are based  and the cyclical nature of our industry 
the projections assumed a gradual recovery of operating margins over a multi year period  eventually returning to levels of profitability in the range of average historical levels 
the market based wacc used in the income approach for mrb was 
assuming all other components of the fair value estimate were held constant  an increase in the wacc rate in excess of could result in a failure of the step impairment test for the mrb reporting unit 
we also use a market approach based on earnings multiple data and our company s market capitalization to corroborate our reporting units valuations 
we reconcile the company s market capitalization to the aggregated estimated fair value of our reporting units  including consideration of a control premium representing the estimated amount an investor would pay to obtain a controlling interest 
the implied control premium resulting from the difference between our market capitalization based on the average trading price of the company s class a common stock for the two week period ending may  and the higher aggregated estimated fair value of our reporting units was above the historical range of premiums observed in normal market conditions on transactions within the steel making and scrap processing industries and in other comparable sectors 
we believe the implied control premium reflected the recent impact on our stock price of current depressed market conditions in our industry  weak macroeconomic indicators and the cyclical nature of our business 
there were no additional triggering events during the fourth quarter of fiscal requiring an impairment test of goodwill 
as a result of the inherent uncertainty associated with forming these estimates  actual results could differ from those estimates 
future events and changing market conditions may impact our assumptions as to future revenue growth rates  pace and extent of operating margins recovery  market based wacc rate and other factors that may result in changes in our estimates of future cash flows 
although we believe the assumptions used in testing our reporting units goodwill for impairment are reasonable  it is reasonably possible that market and economic conditions deteriorate further  including additional declines in or a lack of long term recovery of market conditions from current levels  a lack of recovery in our share price from current levels  or an increase in the market based wacc rate  among other factors  which could significantly impact our impairment analysis and increase the schnitzer steel industries  inc form k 
table of contents likelihood of future goodwill impairment charges that  if incurred  could be material to our results of operations and financial position 
environmental costs we operate in industries that inherently possess environmental risks 
to manage these risks  we employ both our own environmental staff and outside consultants 
environmental staff and finance personnel meet regularly to discuss environmental risks 
we estimate future costs for known environmental remediation requirements and accrue for them on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that we have incurred a liability and the related costs can be reasonably estimated but the timing of incurring the estimated costs is unknown 
the regulatory and government management of these projects is complex  which is one of the primary factors that make it difficult to assess the cost of potential and future remediation 
when only a wide range of estimated amounts can be reasonably established and no other amount within the range is better than any other  the low end of the range is recorded in the financial statements 
if further developments or resolution of an environmental matter result in facts and circumstances that are significantly different than the assumptions used to develop these reserves  the accrual for environmental remediation could be materially understated or overstated 
adjustments to these liabilities are made when additional information becomes available that affects the estimated costs to study or remediate any environmental issues or when expenditures for which reserves are established are made 
the factors we consider in the recognition and measurement of environmental liabilities include current regulations  both at the time the reserve is established and during the course of the investigation or remediation process  which specify standards for acceptable remediation  information about the site which becomes available as the site is studied and remediated  the professional judgment of senior level internal staff  who take into account similar  recent instances of environmental remediation issues  and studies of our sites  among other considerations  technologies available that can be used for remediation  and the number and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties and the extent of their responsibility for the costs of study and remediation 
our accrued environmental liabilities as of august  included million related to third party investigation costs for the portland harbor superfund site 
because there has not been a determination of the total cost of the investigations  the remediation that will be required  the amount of natural resource damages or how the costs of the ongoing investigations and any remedy and natural resource damages will be allocated among the prps  we believe it is not possible to reasonably estimate the amount or range of costs which it is likely or reasonably possible that we may incur in connection with the site  although such costs could be material to our financial position  results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
therefore  no additional amounts have been accrued

inventories our inventories primarily consist of scrap metal ferrous  nonferrous  processed and unprocessed  nonferrous recovered joint product  used and salvaged vehicles  semi finished steel products billets and finished steel products primarily rebar  merchant bar and wire rod 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
we consider estimated future selling prices when determining the estimated net realizable value for our inventory 
as mrb generally sells its export recycled ferrous metal under contracts that provide for shipment within to days after the price is agreed  we utilize the selling prices under committed contracts and sales orders for determining the estimated market price of quantities on hand 
the accounting process we use to record metal quantities relies on significant estimates 
with respect to unprocessed metal inventory  we rely on weighed quantities that are reduced by estimated amounts that are moved into production 
these estimates utilize estimated recoveries and yields that are based on historical trends 
over time  these estimates are reasonably good indicators of what is ultimately produced  however  actual recoveries and yields can vary depending on product quality  moisture content and source of the unprocessed metal 
if ultimate recoveries and yields are significantly different than estimated  the value of our inventory could be materially overstated or understated 
to assist in validating the reasonableness of these estimates  we periodically review shrink factors and perform monthly physical inventory estimates 
however  due to variations in product density  holding period and production processes utilized to manufacture the product  physical inventories will not necessarily detect all variances 
to mitigate this risk  we adjust the ferrous physical inventories when the volume of a commodity is low and a physical inventory count can more accurately predict the remaining volume 
business combinations in a business combination  we recognize the assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree schnitzer steel industries  inc form k 
table of contents at the acquisition date  measured at their fair values as of that date  generally using a market based income approach 
measuring assets and liabilities at fair value requires us to determine the price that would be paid by a third party market participant based on the highest and best use of the assets or interests acquired 
we utilize management estimates that incorporate input from an independent third party valuation firm in our determination of these fair values 
such estimates and valuations require us to make significant assumptions  including projections of future events and operating performance and determining the highest and best use of the assets or interests acquired 
acquisition costs are expensed as incurred 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when we have a contract or purchase order from a customer with a fixed price  the title and risk of loss transfer to the buyer and collectibility is reasonably assured 
title for both metal and finished steel products transfers based on contract terms 
a significant portion of our ferrous export sales of recycled metal are made with letters of credit  reducing credit risk 
however  domestic recycled ferrous metal sales  nonferrous sales and sales of finished steel are generally made on open account 
nonferrous export sales typically require a deposit prior to shipment 
all sales made on open account are evaluated for collectibility prior to revenue recognition 
additionally  when detailed documents support revenue recognition based on transfer of title and risk of loss we recognize revenues on partially loaded shipments  which requires an estimate of the product weight involved in any partial shipments at period end 
for apb  retail revenues are recognized when customers pay for parts  and wholesale product revenues are recognized when customer weight certificates are received following shipment 
historically  there have been very few sales returns and adjustments that impact the ultimate collection of revenues  therefore  no material provisions have been made when the sale is recognized 
we present taxes assessed by governmental authorities collected from customers on a net basis 
therefore  the taxes are excluded from revenue and are shown as a liability on our consolidated balance sheets until remitted 
see the discussion on credit risk contained in item a of this report 
redeemable noncontrolling interest we have issued common stock of one of our subsidiaries to a noncontrolling interest holder of that subsidiary that is redeemable both at the option of the holder and upon the occurrence of an event that is not solely within our control 
since redemption of the noncontrolling interest is outside of our control  this interest is presented on the consolidated balance sheets in the mezzanine section under the caption redeemable noncontrolling interest 
if the interest were to be redeemed  we would be required to purchase all of such interest at fair value on the date of redemption 
the redeemable noncontrolling interest is presented at the greater of its carrying amount adjusted for the noncontrolling interest s share of the allocation of income or loss of the subsidiary  dividends to and contributions from the noncontrolling interest or its fair value as of each measurement date 
any adjustments to the carrying amount of the redeemable noncontrolling interest for changes in fair value prior to exercise of the redemption option are recorded to retained earnings 
as of august   the noncontrolling interest was presented at its adjusted carrying value of million  which approximates its fair value 
we estimate fair value using level inputs under the fair value hierarchy based on standard valuation techniques using a discounted cash flow analysis 
the determination of fair value requires management to apply significant judgment in formulating estimates and assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model  including primarily revenue growth rates driven by future commodity prices and volume expectations  operating margins  capital expenditures  working capital requirements  terminal growth rates and an appropriate discount rate 
the subsidiary is presently undertaking significant investments to install a shredder and related processing and sorting equipment and increase shipping capabilities 
as a result  projections of future cash flows assume volumes to grow above historical levels once construction activity is complete and the new equipment is put in service 
the present value of future cash flows are determined using a market based weighted average cost of capital of  including a subject company risk premium 
a increase decrease in the discount rate would decrease increase the estimated fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest by approximately 
we also used a market approach based on earnings multiple data to corroborate the fair value estimate of the noncontrolling interest determined using the discounted cash flow model 
as a result of the inherent uncertainty associated with forming these estimates  including changes in general market conditions  actual results could differ from those estimates which may result in a material change in the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk we are exposed to commodity price risk  mainly associated with variations in the market price for finished steel products  ferrous and nonferrous metals  including scrap metal  autobodies and other commodities 
the timing and magnitude of industry cycles are difficult to predict and are impacted by general economic conditions 
we respond to increases and decreases in forward selling prices by adjusting purchase prices on a timely basis 
we actively manage our exposure to commodity price risk and monitor the actual and expected spread between forward selling prices and purchase costs and processing and shipping expense 
sales contracts are based on prices negotiated with our customers  and generally orders are placed to days ahead of shipment date 
however  financial results may be negatively impacted when forward selling prices fall more quickly than we can adjust purchase prices or when customers fail to meet their contractual obligations 
we assess the net realizable value of inventory nrv each quarter based upon contracted sales orders and estimated future selling prices 
based on contracted sales and estimates of future selling prices  a decrease in the selling price of inventory would not have caused an nrv impact at any of our operating segments as of august  interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates related to our debt obligations 
our credit line and revolving credit facility are subject to variable interest rates and therefore have exposure to changes in interest rates 
if market interest rates had changed from actual interest rate levels in fiscal or  the effect on our interest expense and net income would not have been material 
credit risk credit risk relates to the risk of loss that might occur as a result of non performance by counterparties of their contractual obligations to take delivery of scrap metal and finished steel products and to make financial settlements of these obligations 
we manage our exposure to credit risk through a variety of methods  including shipping ferrous scrap metal exports under letters of credit  collection of deposits prior to shipment for certain nonferrous export customers and establishment of credit limits for sales on open terms 
mrb generally ships ferrous bulk sales to foreign customers under contracts supported by letters of credit issued or confirmed by banks it deems creditworthy 
the letters of credit ensure payment by the customer 
as mrb generally sells its export recycled ferrous metal under contracts or orders that generally provide for shipment within to days after the price is agreed  mrb s customers typically do not have difficulty obtaining letters of credit from their banks in periods of rising ferrous prices  as the value of the letters of credit are collateralized by the value of the inventory on the ship 
however  in periods of significantly declining prices  mrb s customers may not be able to obtain letters of credit for the full sales value of the inventory to be shipped 
as such  we may need to extend credit on open terms for the difference between the sales value under the contract and the value supported by the letter of credit 
in addition  we could be exposed to loss if a customer fails to pay or the bank providing the letter of credit fails
