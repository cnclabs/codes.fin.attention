critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations relates to our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the revenue recognition  the share based compensation expense recognition  income taxes and uncertain tax positions  recognition of noncontrolling interest  computation of net income per share  determination of fair value of financial instruments  determination of net accounts receivable  accounting for investment in debt securities  accounting for equity investments  assessment of impairment for long lived assets and goodwill  determination of the amortization pattern of licensed video content  determination of the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities acquired through business combination  determination of the fair value of contingent consideration  determination of the fair value of mezzanine equity  determination of segment aggregation and determination of functional currencies represent critical accounting policies that reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
the recognition of revenues involves certain management judgments 
the amount and timing of our revenues could be materially different for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
online advertising revenues online advertising revenues include revenues from brand advertising services as well as search and others services 
for a barter transaction involving online advertising services  we recognize revenue and expense at fair value only if the fair value of the advertising services surrendered received in the transaction is determinable 
no revenue from advertising for advertising barter transaction is recognized 
brand advertising revenues brand advertising revenues are recognized after deducting agent rebates and applicable business tax and related surcharges 

table of contents currently the brand advertising business mainly has three types of pricing models  consisting of the fixed price pricing model  the cost per click cpc pricing model and the cost per impression cpm pricing model 
for a majority of brand advertising revenues  the fixed price pricing model is applied 
a contract is signed to establish a fixed price for the advertising services to be provided 
under the cpc and cpm pricing models  the total price for the advertising services is not fixed in the contract  which instead states a price for each click or for each display 
advertisers using the cpc pricing model pay us only when a user clicks on one of their advertisements  and we recognize as revenue the fees charged to advertisers each time a user clicks on one of the advertisements that appears on our websites 
advertisers using the cpm pricing model pay us based on the number of times their advertisements appear on our websites  and we recognize as revenue the fees charged to advertisers each time their advertisements are displayed on the websites 
we provide advertisement placements to our advertising customers on our different website channels and in different formats  which can include  among other things  banners  links  logos  buttons  rich media  pre roll and post roll video screens  pause video screens and content integration  as specified in the contracts with the customers 
for brand advertising revenue recognition  prior to entering into contracts  we make a credit assessment of the customer to assess the collectability of the contract 
for those contracts for which the collectability is determined to be reasonably assured  we recognize revenue when all revenue recognition criteria are met 
for those contracts for which the collectability is determined not to be reasonably assured  we recognize revenue only when the cash was received and all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
before  we treated multiple elements of advertising contracts as a single unit of accounting for revenue recognition purposes 
on january   in accordance with asu no 
 we began to treat advertising contracts with multiple deliverable elements as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes and to recognize revenue on a periodic basis during the contract when each deliverable service is provided 
since the contract price is for all deliverables  we allocate the arrangement consideration to all deliverables at the inception of the arrangement on the basis of their relative selling prices according to the selling price hierarchy established by asu no 
we use a vendor specific objective evidence of selling price  if it exists  otherwise  b third party evidence of selling price 
if neither a nor b exists  we will use c management s best estimate of the selling price for that deliverable 
search and others revenues search and others services mainly include pay for click services  priority placement services  and online marketing services on the sogou web directory 
sogou web directory is a chinese web directory navigation site which serves as a key access point to popular and preferred websites and applications 
pay for click services mainly consist of displaying text based links of sogou s advertisers on sogou s websites and sogou s website alliance network 
priority placement services are placed in sogou s search directory and are normally provided for a fixed fee over the service period of the contracts 
online marketing services mainly consist of displaying links to sogou s advertisers websites on the web pages of sogou web directory 
revenue for pay for click services is recognized on a per click basis when the users click on the displayed links 
revenue for priority placement services is normally recognized on a straight line basis over the contract period  provided our obligations under the contract have been met and all revenue recognition criteria have been met 
the priority of the display of text based links is based on the bidding price of different advertisers 
revenue for online marketing services on the sogou web directory is normally recognized on a straight line basis over the contract period  provided our obligations under the contract have been met and all revenue recognition criteria have been met 
we pay sogou s website alliance members a portion of pay for click revenues generated from clicks by users of their properties 
we recognize gross revenue for the amount of fees we receive from our advertisers 
payments made to sogou s website alliance members are included in cost of search and others revenues 
determining whether revenue should be reported gross or net is based on an assessment of various factors  the primary factor being whether we are acting as the principal in offering services to the customer or whether we are acting as an agent in the transaction 
we recognize gross revenue  as we have the primary responsibility for fulfillment and acceptability of the pay for click services 
whether we are serving as principal or agent in a transaction is judgmental in nature and is determined by evaluating the terms of the arrangement 
online game revenues our online game revenues are generated from mmog operations revenues  web based game revenues and overseas licensing revenues 
mmog operations revenues revenues are recorded net of business tax  discounts and rebates to distributors 

table of contents online game revenues from changyou s current mmog operations are earned by providing online services to players pursuant to the item based revenue model 
under the item based revenue model  the basic game play functions are free of charge and players are charged for purchases of in game virtual items 
the online game revenue is recognized over the estimated lives of the virtual items purchased or as the virtual items are consumed 
if different assumptions were used in deriving the estimated lives of the virtual items  the timing of our recording of the revenues would be impacted 
game operations revenues are collected by changyou s vies through the sale of changyou s prepaid cards  which it sells in both virtual and physical forms to third party distributors and players 
proceeds received from sales of prepaid cards are initially recorded as receipts in advance from customers and  upon activation or charge of the prepaid cards  are transferred from receipts in advance from customers to deferred revenues 
as changyou does not have control of  and generally does not know  the ultimate selling price of the prepaid cards sold by distributors  net proceeds from distributors form the basis of revenue recognition 
prepaid cards will expire two years after the date of card production if they have never been activated 
the proceeds from the expired game cards are recognized as revenue upon expiration of cards 
once the prepaid cards are activated and credited to a player s personal game account  they will not expire as long as the personal game account remains active 
changyou is entitled to suspend and close a player s personal game account if it has been inactive for a period of consecutive days 
the unused balances in an inactive player s personal game account are recognized as revenues when the account is suspended and closed 
web based game revenue as a result of changyou s acquisition  through its vie beijing gamease age digital technology co  ltd 
gamease  of a majority of shenzhen road technology co  ltd 
road  we generated web based game revenues for the first time in road s web based game is designed to be operated under the item based revenue model 
road has licensed the game to third party operators who offer the game to users in china and other countries on their websites or platforms 
the licensing agreements provide for two revenue streams  an initial fixed license fee and a monthly revenue based royalty 
since road is required to provide when and if available upgrades to the licensees during the license period  the initial license fee is recognized ratably as revenue over the license period 
since the third party operator is the party that signs the user agreement with its users and is responsible for its users experience on its websites or platforms  road is not the primary obligor  and the net revenue based royalty paid by the third party operator is recorded as revenue 
for arrangements where the game is hosted on the operators servers  revenue is recognized upon the conversion of the virtual currency of the operators to the game coins of road  as road s remaining obligation is deemed to be inconsequential and perfunctory 
for arrangements where the game is hosted on our servers  revenue is recognized when virtual items purchased are consumed or over the estimated lives of the virtual items  as road is obliged to provide on going services to users and our remaining obligation is deemed not to be inconsequential and perfunctory after the conversion of the virtual currency of the operators to the game coins of road 
therefore  the revenue should be recognized when the game service is delivered to the game players  which occurs when the virtual items are consumed and or amortized according to the virtual items estimated useful lives 
overseas licensing revenue we enter into licensing arrangements with overseas licensees to operate its mmogs in other countries or territories 
these licensing agreements provide two revenue streams  consisting of an initial license fee and a monthly revenue based royalty fee based on monthly revenue and sales from ancillary products of the games 
the initial license fee is based on both a fixed amount and additional amounts receivable upon achieving certain sales targets 
since we are obligated to provide post sales services such as technical support and provision of updates and when and if available upgrades to the licensees during the license period  the initial license fee from the licensing arrangement is recognized as revenue ratably over the license period 
the fixed amount of the initial license fee is recognized ratably over the remaining license period from the launch of the game and the additional amount is recognized ratably over the remaining license period from the date such additional amount is certain 
the monthly revenue based royalty fee is recognized when relevant services are delivered  provided that collectability is reasonably assured 

table of contents wireless revenues our wireless revenues are generated from the provision of mobile related services through different types of wireless products to mobile phone users 
the mobile related services consist of the provision of content such as news  weather forecasts  chatting  entertainment information  mobile games  mobile phone ringtones and logo downloads 
a majority of the content is purchased from third party content providers 
the wireless products consist mainly of short messaging services sms  ring back tone rbt  interactive voice response ivr and mobile games 
in order to transfer our products to mobile phone users  we sign contracts with china mobile communications corporation china mobile  china united network communication group company limited china unicom  china telecom corporation china telecom and their subsidiaries  as well as other small mobile network operators 
these mobile network operators are collectively presented as china mobile network operators 
the contracts signed with china mobile network operators define the forms of wireless products to be provided  the billing and collection and transmission services offered to the mobile phone users 
the china mobile network operators charge their users wireless service fees on a monthly or per message download basis  and pay such service fees to us after deducting the china mobile network operators share of the fees 
wireless revenues are recognized in the month in which the service is performed  provided that no significant obligations remain 
for the amount of revenues to be recognized  we rely on billing confirmations issued by china mobile network operators 
due to technical issues with the operator s network  we might be unable to collect certain wireless service fees from an operator in certain circumstances 
this un collectability is referred to as the failure rate  which can vary from operator to operator 
if at the end of each reporting period  an operator has not yet issued such billing confirmations  we use the information generated from our internal system or the operator s system as well as historical data to estimate the failure rate  to estimate the amount of collectable wireless service fees and to recognize revenue 
when we later receive the billing confirmation  we then record a true up accounting adjustment 
although we believe we have the ability to make reasonable estimates for most of the wireless services provided  the differences between the actual facts and our estimates may result in significant fluctuations in the amount and timing of the revenue recognized 
for the three months ended december   of our estimated wireless revenues were confirmed by billing confirmations received from china mobile network operators 
generally  i within to days after the end of each month  we receive billing confirmations from the operators and ii within to days after delivering billing confirmations  each operator remits the wireless service fees  net of its service fees  to us 
our management must determine whether to record our wireless revenues using the gross or net method of reporting 
determining whether revenue should be reported gross or net is based on an assessment of various factors  the primary factors being whether we are acting as the principal in offering services to the customer or whether we are acting as an agent in the transaction and the specific requirements of each contract 
currently  a majority of our wireless revenues are recorded on a gross basis  as we have the primary responsibility for fulfillment and acceptability of the wireless services 
to the extent we are acting as a principal in a transaction  we report as revenue payments received on a gross basis  and report as costs of revenue amounts attributable to services provided by china mobile network operators and other vendors 
to the extent we are acting as an agent in a transaction  we report on a net basis as revenue payments received 
whether we are serving as principal or agent in a transaction is judgmental in nature and is determined by evaluating the terms of the arrangement 

table of contents others revenues other revenues are primarily generated from sub licensing of licensed video content and cinema advertisements 
revenue from sub licensing of licensed video content for licensed video content purchased with payment in cash on an exclusive basis  we have rights to sub license to other platforms 
therefore  revenue from sub licensing of licensed video content is recognized when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of a sub licensing arrangement exists  the content has been delivered or is available for immediate and unconditional delivery  the sub license period as indicated in the arrangement has begun and the sub licensee can begin its exploitation exhibition  the sub licensing fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the sub licensing fee is reasonably assured 
revenue from cinema advertisements for cinema advertising revenues  a contract is signed with the advertiser to establish a fixed price and specify advertising services to be provided 
based on the contracts  we provide advertisement placements in advertising slots to be shown in theatres before the screening of movies 
the rights to place advertisements in such advertising slots are granted under contracts with different theatres and film production companies 
revenue from cinema advertising is recognized when all the recognition criteria are met 
depending on the terms of a customer contract  fees for services performed can be recognized according to two principal methods proportional performance or straight line 
proportional performance method fees are generally recognized based on a percentage of the advertising slots actually delivered where the fee is earned on a per advertising slot placement basis straight line method fees are recognized on a straight line basis over the contract period when the fee is not paid based on the number of advertising slots actually delivered 
share based compensation expense sohu  changyou and sogou all have incentive plans for the granting of share based awards  including common stock ordinary shares  share options  restricted shares and restricted share units  to their employees and directors 
share based compensation expense is recognized as costs and or expenses in the consolidated financial statements based on the fair value of the related share based awards on their grant dates 
for sohu s share based awards  in determining the fair value of share options granted  the black scholes valuation model is applied  in determining the fair value of restricted share units granted  the public market price of the underlying shares on the grant dates is applied 
for changyou s share based awards  in determining the fair value of ordinary shares  restricted shares and restricted share units granted in  the income approach discounted cash flow method with a discount for lack of marketability was applied  given that the shares underlying the awards were not publicly traded at the time of grant 
in determining the fair value of restricted share units granted in before changyou s initial public offering  the fair value of the underlying shares was determined based on changyou s offering price for its initial public offering 
in determining the fair value of restricted share units granted after changyou s initial public offering  the public market price of the underlying shares on the grant dates is applied 
for sogou s share based awards  in determining the fair value of share options granted  the income approach discounted cash flow method with a discount for lack of marketability was applied  given that the shares underlying the awards were not publicly traded at the time of grant 
share based compensation expense for the ordinary shares granted is fully recognized in the quarter during which these ordinary shares are granted 
for share options  restricted shares and restricted share units granted with respect to sohu shares and with respect to changyou shares  compensation expense is recognized on an accelerated basis over the requisite service period 
for share options granted with respect to sogou shares  compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the estimated period during which the service period requirement and performance target will be met 
the number of share based awards for which the service is not expected to be rendered over the requisite period is estimated  and the related compensation expense is not recorded for that number of awards 

table of contents the assumptions used in share based compensation expense recognition represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
if factors change or different assumptions are used  our share based compensation expense could be materially different for any period 
moreover  the estimates of fair value are not intended to predict actual future events or the value that ultimately will be realized by employees who receive equity awards  and subsequent events are not indicative of the reasonableness of the original estimates of fair value made by us for accounting purposes 
income taxes and uncertain tax positions income taxes income taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability approach which requires the recognition of income taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
deferred income taxes are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance  if based on available evidence  it is considered that it is more likely than not that some portion of or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in making such determination  we consider factors including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  future profitability  and tax planning strategies 
if events were to occur in the future that would allow us to realize more of our deferred tax assets than the presently recorded net amount  an adjustment would be made to the deferred tax assets that would increase income for the period when those events occurred 
if events were to occur in the future that would require us to realize less of our deferred tax assets than the presently recorded net amount  an adjustment would be made to the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets that would decrease income for the period when those events occurred 
our deferred tax assets are related to net operating losses and temporary differences between accounting and tax basis for our china based subsidiaries and vies that are subject to corporate income tax in the prc under the cit law prc corporate income tax 
significant management judgment is required in determining income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities 
uncertain tax positions in order to assess uncertain tax positions  we apply a more likely than not threshold and a two step approach for tax position measurement and financial statement recognition 
for the two step approach  the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon settlement 
noncontrolling interest noncontrolling interest is the portion of economic interest in sohu s majority owned subsidiaries and vies which is not attributable  directly or indirectly  to sohu 
currently  the noncontrolling interest in our consolidated financial statements mainly consists of noncontrolling interest for changyou and sogou 
noncontrolling interest for changyou to reflect the economic interest in changyou held by shareholders other than sohu noncontrolling shareholders  changyou s net income attributable to these noncontrolling shareholders is recorded as noncontrolling interest in sohu s consolidated statements of comprehensive income  based on their share of the economic interests in changyou 
changyou s cumulative results of operations attributable to these noncontrolling shareholders  along with changes in shareholders equity  adjustment for share based compensation expense in relation to those share based awards which are unvested and vested but not yet settled and adjustment for changes in sohu s ownership in changyou from sohu s purchase of changyou adss representing class a ordinary shares  are recorded as noncontrolling interest in sohu s consolidated balance sheets 

table of contents noncontrolling interest for sogou to reflect the economic interest in sogou held by shareholders other than sohu noncontrolling shareholders  sogou s net income loss attributable to these noncontrolling shareholders is recorded as noncontrolling interest in sohu s consolidated statements of comprehensive income 
sogou s cumulative results of operations attributable to these noncontrolling shareholders  along with changes in shareholders equity deficit and adjustment for share based compensation expense in relation to those share based awards which are unvested and vested but not yet settled and noncontrolling shareholders original investments in series a preferred shares are accounted for as a noncontrolling interest classified as permanent equity in sohu s consolidated balance sheets  as redemption of the noncontrolling interest is solely within the control of sohu 
these treatments are based on the terms governing investment by the noncontrolling shareholders in the series a preferred shares of sogou the sogou series a terms and the terms of sogou s restructuring 
by virtue of the sogou series a terms and the terms of the restructuring  as sogou loses money after its restructuring  the net losses will be allocated in the following order i net losses will be allocated to sohu until its basis in sogou decreases to zero  ii additional net losses will be allocated to alibaba  china web and photon until their investment in sogou decreases to zero  and iii further net losses will be allocated between sohu and noncontrolling shareholders based on their shareholding percentage in sogou 
any subsequent net income from sogou will be allocated in the following order i net income will be allocated between sohu and noncontrolling shareholders based on their shareholding percentage in sogou until their basis in sogou increases to zero  ii additional net income will be allocated to alibaba  china web and photon to bring their basis back  iii further net income will be allocated to sohu to bring its basis back  and iv further net income will be allocated between sohu and noncontrolling shareholders based on their shareholding percentage in sogou 
net income per share basic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period 
diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares and  if dilutive  potential common shares outstanding during the period 
potential common shares comprise shares issuable upon the exercise or settlement of share based awards using the treasury stock method 
the dilutive effect of share based awards with performance requirements is not considered before the performance targets are actually met 
the computation of diluted net income per share does not assume conversion  exercise  or contingent issuance of securities that would have an anti dilutive effect ie  an increase in earnings per share amounts or a decrease in loss per share amounts on net income per share 
additionally  for purposes of calculating the numerator of diluted net income per share  the net income attributable to sohu is adjusted as follows changyou s net income attributable to sohu is determined by the percentage of the weighted average number of changyou shares held by sohu over the weighted average number of changyou ordinary shares and shares issuable upon the exercise or settlement of share based awards under the treasury stock method  instead of by the percentage of the economic interest in changyou held by sohu  which is used for the calculation of basic net income per share 
sogou s net income loss attributable to sohu is determined by the percentage of the weighted average number of sogou shares held by sohu over the weighted average number of sogou ordinary shares  shares issuable upon the conversion of convertible preferred shares under the if converted method  and shares issuable upon the exercise or settlement of share based awards under the treasury stock method  instead of by sogou s net income loss allocated to sohu by virtue of the sogou series a terms and the terms of the restructuring  which is used for the calculation of basic net income per share 

table of contents fair value of financial instruments our financial instruments include cash equivalents  short term investments  accounts receivable  investment in debt securities  prepaid and other current assets  accounts payable  receipts in advance and deferred revenue  accrued liabilities and other short term liabilities 
the carrying amount of accounts receivable  prepaid and other current assets  accounts payable  receipts in advance and deferred revenue  accrued liabilities and other short term liabilities approximates their fair value 
other financial instruments are measured at their respective fair values 
for fair value measurements  us gaap establishes a three tier hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value level observable inputs that reflect quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets 
level include other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the market place 
level unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity 
the fair value hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value 
cash equivalents our cash equivalents mainly consist of time deposits placed with banks with an original maturity of three months or less 
short term investments for investments in financial instruments with a variable interest rate indexed to the performance of underlying assets  we elected the fair value method at the date of initial recognition and carried these investments subsequently at fair value 
changes in the fair value are reflected in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income 
accounts receivable  net the carrying value of accounts receivable is reduced by an allowance that reflects our best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected 
we make estimations of the collectability of accounts receivable 
many factors are considered in estimating the general allowance  including but not limited to reviewing delinquent accounts receivable  performing an aging analysis and a customer credit analysis  and analyzing historical bad debt records and current economic trends 
additional allowance for specific doubtful accounts might be made if the financial conditions of our customers or the china mobile network operators deteriorate or the china mobile network operators are unable to collect fees from their end customers  resulting in their inability to make payments due to us 
investment in debt securities we invest our excess cash in certain debt securities of high quality corporate issuers 
we elected the fair value option to account for our investment in debt securities at their initial recognition 
changes in the fair value are reflected in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income as other income expense 
the fair value election was made to mitigate accounting mismatches and to achieve operational simplifications 
equity investments investments in entities over which we do not have significant influence are recorded as equity investments and are accounted for by the cost method 
investments in entities over which we have significant influence but do not control are also recorded as equity investments and are accounted for by the equity method 
under the equity method  our share of the post acquisition profits or losses of the equity investment is recognized in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income  and our share of post acquisition movements in equity investments is recognized in equity in our consolidated balance sheets 
unrealized gains on transactions between us and our equity investments are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the equity investments 
unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred

table of contents long lived assets long lived assets include fixed assets  intangible assets and prepaid non current assets 
fixed assets fixed assets mainly comprise computer equipment and hardware  office building  leasehold improvements  office furniture and vehicles 
fixed assets are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation with no residual value 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
intangible assets intangible assets mainly comprise customer lists  video content and license  developed technologies  computer software purchased from unrelated third parties  domain names and trademarks  marketing rights and others as well as operating rights for licensed games 
intangible assets are recorded at cost less accumulated amortization with no residual value 
amortization of intangible assets other than licensed video content is computed using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
we amortize licensed video content over the shorter of the term of the estimated period over which the benefits of the licensing contract will be enjoyed based on the trend of accumulation of viewership or the applicable licensing period 
beginning in the third quarter of  licensed video content is amortized on an accelerated basis based on the viewership accumulation trend over the shorter of the term of the estimated period over which the benefits of the licensing contract will be enjoyed or the applicable licensing period 
for exclusively licensed video content which we sub licensed to similar platforms in return for payment in cash  we allocated a portion of the video content cost from cost of brand advertising revenues to sub licensing cost 
the allocation is based on the revenues to be generated through sub licensing 
we amortized sub licensing cost using the individual film forecast computation method  which amortizes such costs in the same ratio that actual sub licensing revenue bears as of the current period end to the total of the actual revenue earned and the estimated remaining unrecognized ultimate revenue 
prepaid non current assets prepaid non current assets primarily include prepayments for the office buildings to be built as our and changyou s headquarters before they were recognized as fixed assets  prepayments for the technological infrastructure and fitting out of our office building before they were recognized as fixed assets  and prepaid prc income tax arising from the sale of the business by us to changyou 
since the sale of the business was between entities that are included in our consolidated financial statements  it was considered an intra entity transaction from our perspective  and income taxes paid should be deferred under asc accordingly  we recorded the income tax related to the sale of the business as prepaid prc income tax 
the prepaid prc income tax will be amortized over the period of the weighted average remaining life of the business related assets sold to changyou by us 
impairment of long lived assets the carrying values of long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
based on the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment of long lived assets using the projected discounted cash flow method 
the estimation of future cash flows requires significant management judgment based on our historical results and anticipated results and is subject to many factors 
the discount rate that is commensurate with the risk inherent in our business model is determined by our management 
an impairment loss would be recorded if we determined that the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable 
the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying values of the assets exceed the fair value of the assets 

table of contents goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired as a result of our acquisitions of interests in our subsidiaries and vies 
we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis as of october  and between annual tests when an event occurs or circumstances change that could indicate that the asset might be impaired 
commencing in september  we early adopted the financial accounting standards board fasb revised guidance on testing of goodwill for impairment 
under this guidance  we have the option to choose whether we will apply the qualitative assessment first and then the quantitative assessment  if necessary  or to apply the quantitative assessment directly 
for certain reporting units  we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if we decide  as a result of our qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the quantitative impairment test is mandatory 
otherwise  no further testing is required 
the quantitative impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of goodwill with its carrying value 
for other reporting units  we test for goodwill impairment by quantitatively comparing the fair values of those reporting units to their carrying amounts  without qualitative assessment 
application of a goodwill impairment test requires significant management judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units  assigning goodwill to reporting units  and determining the fair value of each reporting unit 
the judgment in estimating the fair value of reporting units includes estimating future cash flows  determining appropriate discount rates and making other assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit 
contingent consideration our contingent consideration mainly includes contingent payments generated from the acquisition of road 
the acquisition of road includes a contingent consideration arrangement that requires additional consideration to be paid by changyou based on the future financial performance of road through december  the fair value of the contingent consideration recognized on the acquisition date was estimated by an independent valuation firm  with the income approach applied 
there are no indemnification assets involved 
mezzanine equity on may   changyou  through its vie gamease  acquired of the equity interests in road and began to consolidate road s financial statements on june  mezzanine equity consists of noncontrolling interest in road and a put option pursuant to which the noncontrolling shareholders will have the right to put their equity interests in road to changyou at a pre determined price if road achieves specified performance milestones in the coming three years and certain circumstances occur 
the put option will expire in since the occurrence of the sale is not solely within the control of changyou  we classify the noncontrolling interest as mezzanine equity instead of permanent equity in our and changyou s consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with asc subtopic  we calculate  on an accumulative basis from the acquisition date  i the amount of accretion that would increase the balance of noncontrolling interest to its estimated redemption value over the period from the date of the road acquisition to the earliest redemption date of the noncontrolling interest and ii the amount of net profit attributable to noncontrolling shareholders of road based on their ownership percentage 
the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest as mezzanine equity will be adjusted by an accumulative amount equal to the higher of i and ii

impact of recently issued accounting standards in april  the fasb issued revised guidance on reconsideration of effective control for repurchase agreement 
the revised guidance specifies the criterion pertaining to an exchange of collateral should not be a determining factor in assessing effective control  which should focus on a transferor s contractual rights and obligations with respect to transferred financial assets if an entity enters into agreements to transfer financial assets that both entitle and obligate the transferor to repurchase or redeem the financial assets before their maturity 
the revised guidance removes from the assessment of effective control the criterion requiring the transferor to have the ability to repurchase or redeem the financial assets on substantially the agreed terms  even in the event of default by the transferee  and the collateral maintenance implementation guidance related to that criterion 
the revised guidance is effective prospectively to transactions or modifications of existing transactions that occur on or after the first interim or annual period beginning on or after december  early adoption is not permitted

otherwise  no further testing is required 
an entity can choose to perform the qualitative assessment on none  some or all of its reporting units 
moreover  an entity can bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to step one of the impairment test  and then resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk while our reporting currency is the us dollar  to date the majority of our revenues and costs are denominated in rmb and a significant portion of our assets and liabilities are denominated in rmb 
as a result  we are exposed to foreign exchange risk as our revenues and results of operations may be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the rmb 
if the rmb depreciates against the us dollar  the value of our rmb revenues and assets as expressed in our us dollar financial statements will decline 
we do not hold any derivative or other financial instruments that expose us to substantial market risk 
see risk factors we may suffer currency exchange losses if the rmb depreciates relative to the us dollar 
the rmb is currently freely convertible under the current account  which includes dividends  trade and service related foreign exchange transactions  but not under the capital account  which includes foreign direct investment 
in addition  commencing on july   china reformed its exchange rate regime by changing to a managed floating exchange rate regime based on market supply and demand with reference to a basket of currencies 
under the managed floating exchange rate regime  the rmb is no longer pegged to the us dollar 
the exchange rate of the rmb against the us dollar was adjusted to rmb per us dollar as of july   representing an appreciation of about 
the people s bank of china will announce the closing prices of foreign currencies such as the us dollar traded against the rmb in the inter bank foreign exchange market after the closing of the market on each business day  and will make such prices the central parity for trading against the rmb on the following business day

while the international reactions to the rmb revaluation and widening of the rmb s daily trading band have generally been positive  with the increased floating range of the rmb s value against foreign currencies  the rmb may appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the us dollar or other foreign currencies in the long term  depending on the fluctuation of the basket of currencies against which it is currently valued 

table of contents on june   the people s bank of china announced that it has decided to proceed further with the reform of the rmb exchange rate regime to enhance the flexibility of the rmb exchange rate and that emphasis would be placed on reflecting market supply and demand with reference to a basket of currencies 
while so indicating its intention to make the rmb s exchange rate more flexible  the people s bank of china ruled out any sharp fluctuations in the currency or a one off adjustment 
in february  the center point of the currency s official trading band hit  representing appreciation of more than since june  as a result of the announcement  the rmb may appreciate or depreciate more significantly in value against the us dollar or other foreign currencies in the long term  depending on the market supply and demand with reference to a basket of currencies to date  we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
while we may decide to enter into hedging transactions in the future  the effectiveness of these hedges may be limited and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure 
accordingly  we may incur economic losses in the future due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations  which could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
the following table sets forth a summary of our foreign currency sensitive financial instruments as of december   which consisted of cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  investment in debt securities  accounts receivable  prepaid and other current assets  current liabilities  long term accounts payable and contingent consideration

under the investment policy  our excess cash is invested in high quality securities which are limited as to length of time to maturity and the amount of credit exposure 
our exposure to interest rate risk primarily relates to the interest income generated from excess cash invested in demand deposits and debt securities 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio in order to reduce this risk 
we have not been exposed nor do we anticipate being exposed to material risks due to changes in interest rates
