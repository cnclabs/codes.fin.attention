item business general development of business company background and overview 
daktronics  inc was founded by dr 
aelred kurtenbach and dr 
duane sander in while they were professors of electrical engineering at south dakota state university sdsu in brookings  south dakota 
our relationship with sdsu and other colleges and universities is a key factor contributing to our leadership in the industry 
we have been able to experience sustained long term growth due in part to the capability of the local universities and colleges to provide an important source of highly educated full time and student employees 
over the years  our products have evolved significantly  from scoreboards and matrix displays and related software applications to complex  integrated visual display systems that include full color video  text and graphics displays located on a local or remote network and tied together through sophisticated control systems 
in the mid nineties  as light emitting diodes leds became available in red  blue and green colors with outdoor brightness  we pioneered the development of full color led video displays capable of replicating trillions of colors  thereby producing large format video systems with excellent color  brightness  energy efficiency and lifetime 
due to our foundation of developing scoring and graphics display systems  in which we were already a leader  we were able to add video capabilities so all of a customer s large format display needs could be met in a complete  integrated system 
this has proven to be a key factor in daktronics becoming a leader in large electronic displays 
over the years  we have invested in product development to add complementary products and services  such as production services  liquid crystal display lcd networks  architectural lighting solutions  sound systems  marketing services  maintenance and support and other products and services for our customers 
business developments 
as a result of our line of led display systems and software applications  we gained significant market share through designing and manufacturing quality products and providing technical expertise and services 
our products are in use throughout the world  as we are the world s leader in all led display product categories  according to independent research 
in the sports market  our integrated video and scoring systems have been installed at many professional  collegiate and high school facilities  particularly in north america  and at international sporting events such as the olympic games 
with commercial applications  our video  digital billboard and graphics displays can be seen in major destination sites  such as las vegas and times square  along roadsides at retail establishments and at many other locations 
in the transportation market  our vanguard displays are in use in numerous jurisdictions across north america  and our customers include many state departments of transportation 
one of our core growth strategies on a historical basis has been to enter geographic markets by developing a small sales and service presence that provides after sale support to our entire product line and sales of our products 
this network of offices  including home offices  had been an important part of our growth strategy 
although we expect to continue to open offices where it is important to have such a presence  beginning in fiscal and through fiscal  we closed a number of offices that we believed were not critical to 
table of contents our business 
in connection with these closings  most of our employees have transitioned to home offices 
we currently have approximately corporate offices throughout the world 
we occasionally acquire businesses that provide access to new markets or complement our existing products 
although these acquisitions have increased the scope of services and technology that we are able to provide  our primary growth objective is to increase sales and profitability through organic growth 
we manufacture most of our products in south dakota and minnesota 
prior to fiscal  almost all manufacturing was centralized in brookings  south dakota 
as a result of the rapid growth during fiscal years through  we experienced limitations in our ability to effectively hire sufficient numbers of employees in manufacturing 
this caused us to expand operations in into sioux falls  south dakota and redwood falls  minnesota 
we also invested in facilities in shanghai  china  where we manufacture our architectural lighting products and perform final assembly for video displays for the chinese market 
we also have a plant in victor  new york that produces our rigging products 
description of business we are the world s leading supplier of electronic scoreboards  large electronic display systems and related marketing services  digital messaging solutions  software and services for sporting  commercial and transportation applications 
our continuing focus is on supporting customers with superior products  integration and services that provide dynamic  reliable and unique visual communication solutions 
we offer a complete line of products  from small indoor and outdoor scoreboards and electronic displays to large multi million dollar video display systems as well as related control  timing  sound and hoist systems and related professional services 
we are recognized worldwide as a technical leader with the capabilities to design  market  manufacture  install and service complete integrated systems that display real time data  graphics  animation and video 
we are engaged in a full range of activities marketing and sales  engineering and product development  manufacturing  technical contracting  professional services and customer service and support 
each of those activities is described below 
marketing and sales 
our products have been sold throughout the united states and other countries through a combination of direct sales personnel and resellers 
in the united states and canada  we use primarily a direct sales force for professional sports  colleges and universities  convention centers and smaller sports facilities  including high schools and transportation applications 
in smaller commercial applications  we rely primarily on resellers 
we also utilize resellers outside north america on large video system projects where we do not have a direct sales presence 
sales to resellers generally have terms consistent with sales directly to end users 
the majority of the products sold by resellers are standard catalog products 
these are typically moderately priced and relatively easy to install 
a limited number of models are built to inventory and available for quick delivery 
we support our resellers through direct mail advertising  trade journal advertising  trade show exhibitions and our sales force support in the field 
we believe that we can expand sales and  in some niches  market share  by expanding both our direct sales force and resellers 
our direct sales force is comprised of a network of corporate and home offices located throughout the world supporting all customer types in both sales and service 
in addition to supporting resellers as described above  the direct sales staff sells the entire range of our standard products and substantially all of the large video display systems 
our direct sales staff is structured in a way to maximize cross selling opportunities across segments 
we have organized our business into five business units which have a primary focus on particular markets and a secondary focus on opportunities in other markets 
the business units consist of four domestic business units that include the us and canada commercial  live events  schools and theatres  and transportation and a fifth business unit for all international operations 
we believe that customers in each of the domestic areas share common attributes and are different from customers in the other areas which make them conducive to this structure 
for example  live events customers usually have a large variety of products tied into a system in a single location that involve much more creative production services  design and event support 
the commercial business unit serves the needs created by large and remote networks of displays connected through various modes of communication 
the transportation business unit focuses on the unique needs of governmental contractors and ties into integrated systems that manage the flow of travelers and vehicles 
finally  the schools and theatre business unit focuses on the increasing level of support and service and limited resources along with all the statistics and related software and communication needs of athletic conferences and leagues 
the international business unit comprises all of these areas outside of north america 
when we target a potential customer for sales opportunities  the prospect is contacted either directly or through a reseller 
frequently  on larger sales opportunities  engineers  technicians and sales personnel jointly participate in site visits to assess site conditions  evaluate the customer s requirements and assemble and present proposals 
proposals to prospective customers include business and technical presentations as well as product demonstrations and visits to existing installations 
we also regularly host customers at our various manufacturing facilities to demonstrate product quality  manufacturing and design capabilities 

table of contents international sales can fluctuate from year to year based on the timing of large system projects 
a typical term of sale for international projects includes a letter of credit  bank guarantee or partial payment in advance 
we believe that in addition to the growth we expect domestically  we will also achieve growth in the international markets 
during fiscal years  and  approximately percent  percent and percent of our net sales  respectively  were derived from international sales 
since  we have acquired or opened international offices in canada  china  france  the united arab emirates  germany  australia  japan  brazil  spain  singapore  macau  hong kong and the united kingdom 
much of our marketing and sales success in the past was based on our ability to create new products and product enhancements for customers by understanding their needs and opportunities 
we have developed and continue to develop this understanding through active participation in the sales cycle by engineers and other personnel and through attending trade shows  conventions and seminars and fostering a culture of teamwork throughout the organization 
engineering and product development 
the large screen electronic display industry is characterized by ongoing product innovations and developments in technology and complementary services 
to remain competitive  we must continue to anticipate and respond to changes and developments in the industry 
we will continue our tradition of applying engineering resources throughout our business to help achieve more effective product development by investing approximately four percent of our net sales over the long term into product design and development 
we employ engineers and technicians in the areas of mechanical and electrical design  applications engineering  software design and customer and product support 
we use primarily in house engineering to anticipate and respond rapidly to the product development needs of customers and the marketplace 
we assign product managers to each product or product family to assist our sales staff in training and implementing product improvements  and to ensure that each product is designed for maximum reliability and serviceability 
we also invest in new creative technologies and in companies developing new technologies 
our engineering staff consists of four product development groups sports  video  commercial and transportation 
the sports product development group focus is aligned with the schools and theatres business unit  the video group is aligned with the live events  international and commercial business units  and the commercial and transportation groups are aligned with the commercial and transportation business units 
these groups leverage common technology  concepts and platforms through various knowledge centers that span across all groups 
this alignment has driven improved product reliability  lower costs and better functionality for our customers 
the development of these knowledge centers and various other practices within product development are modeled after best practices for lean product development 
manufacturing 
as a vertically integrated manufacturer of display systems  we perform most sub assembly and substantially all final assembly of our products 
our manufacturing operations include component manufacturing and system manufacturing metal fabrication  electronic assembly  sub assembly and final assembly 
we flex our production capacity through varying work hours and the use of outside resources 
we also use outside providers when it is more cost effective 
we use a modular approach for manufacturing displays 
standard product modules are designed to be used in a variety of different products 
this modular approach reduces parts inventory and improves manufacturing efficiency 
we inventory a limited supply of standard products 
custom projects are built according to the customer s specifications through the use of common components 
product modules are designed so that a custom product may include a significant percentage of standard components to maximize reliability and ease of service 
a key strategy of ours is to reduce the need for customization of displays and increase standardization 
our order entry  production  customer service and many other functions are also consolidated through an enterprise resource planning system to facilitate communication among employee teams throughout the entire sales  design  production and delivery process 
we have manufacturing facilities in brookings  south dakota  sioux falls  south dakota  redwood falls  minnesota  victor  new york  and shanghai  china 
locations outside of brookings  south dakota produce a material amount of our products 
our plants are loosely aligned with the five business units described above 
this alignment has been critical to allow us to respond to the different types of customers in the different business units in areas such as lead times and product consolidation 
furthermore  we have decentralized to these plants certain functions such as materials planning and scheduling 
our goal was to generally align sales  marketing  engineering and manufacturing into a cohesive business unit with a focus on customers while not giving up the synergies of shared resources 
on the other hand  given the cyclical nature of some parts of our business  we also needed to balance and maintain our ability to manufacture the same products across our plants so that we can smooth out the peaks and valleys of customer demand of the various business units 
we expect that emphasis on aligning manufacturing to a business unit as opposed to a shared resource will continue to change as our business changes 

table of contents our manufacturing facilities have embraced lean manufacturing techniques throughout all areas 
we also have placed significant emphasis on lean techniques in the non manufacturing areas 
although there are direct costs associated with implementing lean techniques  the goal of doing so is to eliminate waste and deliver products to a customer when the customer desires the products while maintaining minimal inventory and eliminating non value added tasks 
technical contracting 
we serve as a technical contractor for larger display system installations that require custom designs and innovative product solutions 
the purchase of standard displays and other state of the art display systems typically involves competitive proposals 
as a part of our response to a proposal request  we may suggest additional products or features to assist the prospective customer in analyzing the optimal type of display system 
we usually include  as a part of our proposal  site preparation and installation services related to the display system 
in these cases  we serve as a contractor and may retain subcontractors 
we are licensed in a number of domestic jurisdictions as a general contractor 
generally  we outsource all related electrical  steel and installation labor to qualified subcontractors with which we have developed relationships 
professional services 
our professional services are essential to continued market penetration and growth 
professional services we provide in addition to technical contracting include event support  content creation  product maintenance  marketing assistance  training on hardware and software  and display rentals 
our creative production staff provides a variety of services to customers  including video content  event support  control room design  on site training hardware and software  and continuing technical support for operators of complicated display systems 
our sports marketing division provides customers with marketing and ad sales for facilities to fund display system purchases 
these marketing services extend beyond the marketing potential of the equipment in the facility to other facility related components 
typically  we render these services to facilities that do not have in house marketing programs and staff 
we provide these services through our own employees located in company or home offices throughout the world in more than ten countries 
customer service and support 
our customer service distinguishes us from our competitors 
this service includes limited warranties for most of our products against failure due to defective parts or workmanship for periods generally ranging from one to five years after the first sale or installation  depending on the product or type of customer  and extended service agreements 
we also provide help desk access  parts repair and replacement and programming support for video  animation and other displays 
we staff our technical help desk with experienced technicians who are available on call hours a day to support events and sites 
our repair centers  located in the united states  germany and shanghai  are staffed with trained technicians who repair and return components that require service  and we offer a component exchange program for same day shipment of replacement parts 
our north american field service personnel are centralized as opposed to focused on a particular business unit so that we can better focus on the commonality of the products across units rather than the unique needs of each customer 
we also use third party authorized service companies to improve the overall utilization of our field service staff as the needs of the customer fluctuate greatly during the fiscal year 
this allows us to better respond to changes in volume of service  which peaks in the late summer and early fall 
general description of our products and technologies our display technologies have changed significantly since the mid s  when incandescent lamps were the primary display element 
presently  led and lcd technologies are the primary display elements 
the invention and availability of blue and green led in the mid s  along with the already available red led  allowed the introduction of full color video displays using leds as the primary colors to form all other colors in the video display 
the decreasing costs of lcd components along with the drive for smaller displays and digital networks have led to the addition of lcd displays 
driven by customer demand  we have enhanced our video display technology into mobile and modular technologies and high definition capabilities 
the cost  performance and availability of leds have made them the preferred display element for large displays as compared to alternatives such as incandescent and reflective technologies  most of which are obsolete or unproven 
the cost effectiveness  life and performance of lcds have made them the preferred small display solution 
the vast majority of displays we sell today utilize led technology 
the two principal components of many of our systems are the display and the controller 
the controller uses computer hardware and software to process the information provided by the operator and other integrated sources and then compiles the information  graphics or animation to be presented on the display 
data can be transferred between the controller and local or remote displays 
local connections may use wire cables  fiber optic cables  infrared links or radio links 
standard and cellular telephone connections and satellite transmissions are used to connect to remote displays 
the controller controls each of the pixels which are the dots or picture elements that make up the image on the display to present the message or image 

table of contents most of our display technologies rely on one or more of our software products to manage and provide content for the display 
these software products range in complexity from scoring consoles  to the venus control software that allows the creation  display and scheduling of dynamic text and basic graphics content on electronic displays  to the show control display control system that controls multi color displays and video displays  providing the ability to create graphics and animation as well as interfacing with third party software for content 
additionally  our visiconn control software is used to display targeted messages to specific audiences and to control large networks of digital displays 
complementary software  such as our dakstats and interfacing software  is also available and can be fully integrated into the control software 
our display systems range from small scoreboards and digit displays priced at under  to large complex display systems priced in excess of million 
generally  our product sales are either custom products or standard catalog scoreboards or displays 
historically  these standard catalog sales have accounted for less than percent of our total annual revenues 
our custom products are customized in terms of size  configuration and installation type but generally are built using standard technology platforms 
within each product family  we produce displays that vary in complexity  size and resolution 
the physical dimensions of a display depend on the size of the viewing area  the distance from the viewer to the display  and the amount and type of information to be displayed 
generally  for longer distance viewing  the light sources  or pixels  are larger and spaced farther apart 
the type of the display may also depend on the location of the viewing audience 
for example  arena scoreboards may have a viewing angle nearly as wide as degrees  compared with roadside displays  which typically are viewed from a passing vehicle only within a narrow angle from the display 
we customize our products according to the design specifications of the customer and the conditions of the environment in which our products function 
product families and technologies our products are comprised of the following primary product families  all of which include control systems and software scoring and timing products for sports  primarily led scoreboards  audio systems  primarily for sports venues  automated rigging and hoist products  video display systems  including a full line of led technologies in various pixel pitches and display configurations  architectural lighting and display elements  text and graphics displays  digital billboard displays  digit and price displays  and transportation products 
each of these product families are described below 
scoring and timing products 
our line of scoring and timing products includes indoor and outdoor scoreboards for many different sports  digit displays  scoring and timing controllers  statistics software and other related products 
indoor systems range in complexity from two digit shot clocks and small scoreboards to large  center hung scoreboards incorporating video displays  message centers  advertising panels  hoist systems and control software 
outdoor scoreboards range in complexity from two digit game timers and small scoreboards to larger systems incorporating scoring  timing  video  message centers  advertising panels and control software 
we expect led technology will remain the technology of choice for scoreboards and displays due to its lower power consumption  longer life and resulting lower maintenance costs as compared to other technologies 
because most of the scoreboards and display products within this group have significant standardization  we have been able to make progress on our goal of delivering high quality products 
we offer a variety of internally developed controllers complementing our scoreboards and displays 
these controllers vary in price and complexity from the all sport  a handheld controller for portable scoreboards  to the all sport series  designed for more sophisticated scoring systems and allowing for more user defined options 
these controllers communicate with scoreboards through radio frequencies  fiber optic connections or other means 
we also offer timing systems for sports events  primarily aquatics and track competitions 
a primary component of these systems is our omnisport timing console 
the system has the capability to not only time and rank the competitors but also to interface with event management software created by third parties to facilitate the administration of the sporting event 
other timing system components include swimming touchpads  race start systems  and relay take off platforms 
as a key component of an integrated system  we market sports statistics and results software under the dakstats trademark 
the software allows entry and display of sports statistics and other information 
it is one of the leading applications of its type in collegiate and high school sports 

table of contents audio systems 
the audio system offerings include both standard and custom options 
standard audio systems are designed to meet the needs of a wide variety of outdoor sports venues based on the size and configuration of the facility 
each of the standard outdoor systems includes control systems that feature digital signal processing for improved sound quality reproduction 
custom indoor and outdoor systems are also offered for larger venues and venues with unique seating configurations 
our sound systems are often integrated into an overall venue solution that includes scoring  timing  message display and or video capability 
automated rigging and hoist products 
the automated rigging and hoist product family includes our vortek automated hoists which complement our arena center hung scoreboard display systems for both small and large sporting facilities 
the hoist is an important part of an integrated solution for indoor venues that have center hung  suspended displays

additionally  we provide automated rigging for theatre applications  primarily in high schools and similar venues 
the strengths of our automated rigging systems include safety and ease of operation 
the theatre rigging control system includes intuitive touch screens and menus to control the integrated hoist systems for added safety and enhanced operation of a theatre production  making changes in scenery  lighting and sound preprogrammed  timed and easy to control 
video display systems 
this group consists primarily of displays  which are comprised of a large number of full color pixels capable of showing various levels of video  graphics and animation  and controllers  which manage the operation of the display 
video displays are comprised of red  green and blue leds arranged in various combinations to form pixels picture elements 
the electronic circuitry which controls the pixels allows for variances in the relative brightness of each led to provide a full color spectrum  thereby displaying video images in striking  vibrant colors 
we offer a wide range of video display systems for different applications and budgets 
variables in video displays include the spacing of the pixels pixel pitch  the resolution number of pixels of the displays  the brightness of the displays nits  the number of discrete colors that the display is able to produce color depth  and the viewing angles 
in addition  modular design allows the product to be readily configured in custom sizes to meet each customer s specific requirements  with virtually no limit to the size of display that can be built 
we offer a complete line of video display systems that is second to none in the industry 
at the high end  the product is capable of displaying up to quadrillion colors and is available with pixel spacing as close as four millimeters 
currently  we offer a wide range of pixel spacing  ranging from four millimeter to millimeter 
the six millimeter application provides the user with the greatest pixel density and shortest viewing distance  and the millimeter is the most cost effective for physically large displays with longer viewing distances 
in addition  the uniformity of colors across the display is important to the quality of the video image 
our unique display control circuitry  along with our proprietary manufacturing and calibration procedures  provide uniform colors across the display 
in addition to traditional rectangular video displays  we have adapted led video technology into ribbon board displays and modular display systems 
our ribbon board display systems are configured in different height to width ratios to give arenas and stadiums the ability to install long  narrower bands of displays in the facility 
for new construction projects  our prorail attachment system is combined with ribbon board technology to provide improved sight lines for fans and reduce construction costs for the building s owner 
digital ribbon boards generally serve as a revenue generation source for teams and facilities through advertising as well as another location to display information such as scoring and statistics 
our transportable display systems are comprised of lightweight individual led video panels less than a square meter in size that are assembled together to form a display in a customizable height and width 
these panels are used in what we refer to as mobile and modular applications  such as touring shows and the events market 
during the second half of fiscal  we introduced our dvx series outdoor video display technology 
this new generation of product created a common module and cabinet platform across all pixel pitches to gain synergies on materials  improve reliability  decrease selling prices and decrease engineering costs over the long term 
in fiscal  we introduced our dvn series of indoor video display technology to achieve similar goals as our dvx outdoor technology

most of the transportation products are designed and tested to rigorous transportation industry standards 
our personnel routinely work with standards development organizations to assist in writing standards that benefit the public and take advantage of the latest display technologies 
financial information about segments and geographic areas our operations in countries outside the us are accompanied by certain financial and other risks 
relationships with customers and terms of sale vary by country  often with longer term receivables than are typical in the us currency exchange rate fluctuations can affect net sales from  and the profitability of  operations outside the us we attempt to hedge these exposures to reduce the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on net earnings 
in addition  the repatriation of certain earnings of our foreign subsidiaries may result in substantial us tax cost 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for financial information pertaining to our business segments and geographic operations 
sources of raw materials we source some of our raw materials  including leds  power supplies  circuit boards and other components  from a limited number of suppliers  primarily due to quality control or the customized nature of the materials 
the loss of one of these key suppliers could have an adverse impact on our business and operations 
for additional information  refer to item a risk factors 
from time to time  we enter into pricing agreements or purchasing contracts under which we agree to purchase a minimum amount of product in exchange for guaranteed price terms over the length of the contract  which generally does not exceed one year 
intellectual property we develop technology on a continuing basis that we consider for patent application 
we apply for the majority of our patents to establish the creation of the technology so that other parties cannot later claim ownership 
the remainder of our patents are designed to prevent infringement  and we aggressively pursue infringement claims for protection due to patent violations 
we apply for patents in the us and a limited number of foreign jurisdictions 
these patents generally pertain to our display technologies and product features and have various terms of duration 
the patents we hold which are designed to protect and prevent competitors from infringing include  for example  patents on mechanical designs  such as our prorail system and valo mount  formed cabinet design and latching system for modules 
they also include patents for product features and capabilities which we believe are superior in the marketplace and that give us a competitive position  such as our touchpad products for aquatics 
there are a limited number of patents that apply to our electronics due to the rapid rate of change in the industry 
however  we hold patents on such things as calibration methods and pixel arrangements 
due to the general nature of our business and the rapid rate of change in technology  we do not incur significant expenditures in defending or prosecuting patent claims 
we rely on trademarks  in addition to patents  to help establish and preserve limited proprietary protection for our products 
our trademarks are registered in the united states and other countries 
these trademarks are used to establish brand recognition and distinction in our various markets 
product drawings  software  training and product manuals and other works of authorship are also subject to applicable copyright law protections 
we provide software to our customers in object code to help preserve our intellectual property rights 
we also rely on nondisclosure and license agreements with our employees to protect our intellectual property 
despite these intellectual property protections  there can be no assurance that a competitor will not copy the functions or features of our products 
seasonal nature of the business our sales and profitability historically have fluctuated due to the impact of large product orders  such as display systems for facilities where professional and major college sports events take place  and large commercial systems and networks 
the seasonality of the sports market and the concentration of holidays in our third fiscal quarter have also played a part in our sales and profit fluctuations 
as a result  net sales and net income tend to be lower in the third quarter of a fiscal year 

table of contents the seasonality of the sports business is caused by sales related to facilities for football  basketball and hockey in the summer and fall and for baseball in the early to late spring leaving a slower time in the winter 
this seasonal effect can be compounded by large product orders in the sports markets and by the effects of holidays during our third fiscal quarter 
the effects of seasonality unrelated to holidays are generally not found in our commercial  international and transportation business units  although the impact of large orders in those markets and implications of weather during the winter months can cause fluctuations in net sales and profits 
gross margins on large orders tend to fluctuate more than the gross margins on smaller orders 
large product orders that involve competitive bidding and substantial subcontract work for product installation generally have lower gross margins with greater variability in margins 
although we follow the percentage of completion method of recognizing revenues on the majority of these larger orders  we nevertheless have experienced fluctuations in operating results and expect that our future results of operations will be subject to similar fluctuations 
working capital items on large product orders  the time between order acceptance and project completion may extend up to and exceed months depending on the amount of custom work and the customer s delivery needs 
we often receive down payments or progress payments on these orders 
to the extent that these payments are not sufficient to fund the costs and expenses associated with these orders  we use working capital and bank borrowings to finance these cash requirements 
customers the primary markets we serve  along with primary types of customers  are as follows markets types of customers live events large colleges and universities  professional sports teams and facilities  national and international sports games and federations  civic arenas and convention centers  staging and rental  and motor racing 
schools and theatres elementary and secondary schools  small colleges and universities  local recreation centers and theatres 
commercial retailers and outdoor advertisers  hospitality providers  quick serve restaurants  financial institutions  casinos  pari mutuel racing 
transportation state and local departments of transportation  airlines  airports and related industries  parking facilities and transit authorities 
we have a large and diverse customer base 
the nature of our business generally is not repetitive business from one or a few significant customers 
as a result  and except in the outdoor advertising component of our commercial business unit  the loss of a major customer generally would not have a material adverse impact on us 
backlog our backlog consists of customer sales agreements or purchase orders that we expect to fill within the next months and was approximately million as of april  and million as of april  because sales agreements and purchase orders may be subject to cancellation or delay by customers  our backlog is not necessarily indicative of future net sales or net income 
although orders for many of our products may be shipped within days  other orders may take longer depending on the customer s project schedule or other factors 
contracts related to new construction projects generally tend to have the longest lead times 
government and other regulation in the united states and other countries  various laws and regulations  including zoning ordinances  restrict the installation of outdoor signs and displays  particularly in the commercial market 
these laws and regulations include those that impose greater restrictions on electronic displays than on non electronic displays such as traditional billboards due to alleged concerns over aesthetics or driver safety if a display is located near a road or highway 
these factors may prevent or inhibit us from selling products to some prospective customers 
some of our products are tested to safety standards developed by underwriters laboratories in the united states  as well as similar standards in other countries 
we design and produce our products in accordance with these standards 
our manufacturing operations use certain chemical products and chemical processes that are subject to various environmental rules and regulations 
our manufacturing operations must also meet various safety related rules and regulations 
we believe we are in material compliance with applicable governmental laws and regulations 

table of contents in some countries in which we operate  such as china  there are various laws and regulations that may inhibit our operations and financial condition 
these include restrictions or limitations on our ability to withdraw our capital investment  undeveloped legal frameworks to enforce our rights  and different levels of enforcement and consistency of laws 
competition the large electronic display industry is highly fragmented and characterized by intense competition from a variety of sources 
there are a number of established suppliers of competing products which may have greater market penetration in certain of our market niches or greater financial  marketing and other resources 
competitors also attempt to copy our products or product features 
because a customer s budget for the purchase of a large screen electronic display is often part of that customer s advertising budget  we may also compete with other forms of advertising  such as television  print media or fixed display signs 
there are generally more competitors in product categories and applications that require less complicated display systems  such as the high school scoreboard market  the text and graphics display market and the market for less customized video displays 
as the needs of customers increase and the display systems become more complex  there are generally fewer competitors 
however  due to the high profile nature of larger complex display systems  the competition is generally more intense 
within our standard product business  which includes our galaxy and valo display lines and scoreboard products  there are a large number of competitors  none of which we consider to be dominant 
in addition  in the galaxy and valo display business  there are a significant number of asian competitors that attempt to sell in our marketplace and generally compete on the basis of price 
we generally compete based on our depth of service and the wide range of our product offerings 
within our large video system business  across all segments  there are various competitors that have different levels of strength in individual niches  but none that have a dominant position overall 
for example  a single competitor may have strength in the mobile video business but very little in the fixed installation business 
another competitor may have strength in the billboard display business but very little strength in any other large display applications 
in addition  our large display business has competitors in a narrow niche that were significant at one time in that niche and then substantially decreased their presence in that niche 
these changes seem to happen as a result of the complexities of the marketplace and the failures that are experienced on installations that receive a great deal of visibility 
our video systems  especially those systems that are comprised of many displays networked together  are highly complex and visible and thus require a high standard of performance that is difficult for other industry participants to maintain over the long term 
there are a growing number of asian based competitors that are expanding their presence beyond asia to compete more directly with us 
these competitors generally offer limited products and solutions at a lower price 
our competitors are not generally aligned by business unit 
the focus of competitors tends to be more of a product focus 
for example  our galaxy line of displays has competitors that are also concentrated in the commercial business unit  although  like us  they also compete with these same products in our other business units 
competitors with a focus on video displays compete generally across all of our business units 
overall  we compete based on our broad range of products and features  complementary services  advanced technology  prompt delivery  and reliable and readily available customer service and support 
we also strive to provide cost effective products and solutions for our customers 
contrary to our focus on technologically advanced products and customer support  some of our competitors compete in some markets by providing lower cost display systems  which are of a lesser quality with lower product performance or less customer support 
if a customer focuses principally on price  we are less likely to obtain the sale 
to remain competitive  we must continue to enhance our existing products  introduce new products and product features  and provide customers with cost effective solutions to their display needs 
research and development we believe our engineering and product development capability and experience will continue to be a very important factor in our markets 
product development expenses for fiscal years  and were million  million and million  respectively 
environmental concerns our products and production processes require the storage  use and disposal of a variety of chemicals that are considered hazardous under applicable federal and state laws 
accordingly  we are subject to a variety of regulatory requirements for the handling and disposal of such materials 
we do not anticipate any material effect on our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position due to compliance with government regulations involving environmental matters 

table of contents employees as of april   we employed approximately  full time employees and approximately part time and temporary employees 
of these employees  approximately  were in manufacturing  were in sales and marketing  were in customer service  were in engineering and were in general and administrative 
none of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement 
we believe employee relations are good

item a 
risk factors a number of risks and uncertainties exist which could impact our future operating results 
these uncertainties include  but are not limited to  general economic conditions  competition  our success in developing new products and technologies  market acceptance of new products and other factors  including those set forth below 
competition could result in lower net sales and decreased margins 
we operate in highly competitive markets  some of which are highly fragmented 
we also compete against products produced in asia and other parts of the world  including the us  which in some cases are of lower quality or performance and lower cost 
in addition  because a customer s budget for the purchase of an electronic display is often part of that customer s advertising budget  our products often compete with other forms of advertising  such as television  print media or fixed display signs 
competition could result in not only a reduction in net sales but also in the prices charged by us for our products 
to remain competitive  we must be able to not only anticipate and respond quickly to our customers needs and enhance our existing products and services to meet those needs but also continue to price our products competitively 
our competitors may develop cheaper  more efficient products  or they may be willing to charge lower prices for strategic marketing or to increase market share 
some competitors have more capital and other resources than we do and may be better able to take advantage of acquisition opportunities or adapt more quickly to changes in customer requirements  which could negatively affect our ability to compete effectively 
our business may suffer if we are not successful in our efforts to keep up with a rapidly changing product market 
the electronic display industry is characterized by ongoing product improvement  innovations and developments in display and controller technology 
competitors could develop new or superior products to increase their share of the markets 
our future success in addressing the needs of our customers will depend in part on our ability to continue to understand their needs and to make timely and cost effective product improvements  innovations and developments 
we enter into fixed priced contracts on a regular basis  which could reduce our profits 
almost all of the contracts we enter into to sell our products are on a fixed price basis 
if our actual costs exceed original estimates on fixed price contracts  our profits will be reduced 
although we benefit from cost savings  we have a limited ability to recover cost overruns 
because of the large scale and long duration of some contracts  unanticipated cost increases may occur as a result of several factors including  but not limited to  increases in the cost or shortages of components  materials or labor  unanticipated technical problems  required project modifications not initiated by the customer  and suppliers or subcontractors failure to perform or a delay in performing their obligations 
these factors could delay delivery of products  and contracts may provide for liquidated damages for late delivery 
unanticipated costs that cannot be passed on to customers or the payment of liquidated damages under fixed contracts would negatively impact our profits 
backlog may not be indicative of future revenue 
customers may cancel or delay projects for reasons beyond our control 
orders normally contain cancellation provisions that permit our recovery of costs expended and a portion of the anticipated profit if a customer cancels an order 
if a customer elects to cancel  we may not realize the full amount of revenues included in our backlog 
if projects are delayed  the timing of revenues could be affected  and projects may remain in the backlog for extended periods of time 
revenue recognition occurs over longer periods of time and is subject to unanticipated delays 
if we receive relatively large orders in any given quarter  fluctuations in the levels of the quarterly backlog can result because the backlog in that quarter may reach levels that may not be sustained in subsequent quarters 
for these reasons  backlog may not be indicative of future revenues 
our ability to conduct business outside the united states may be adversely affected by factors outside of our control  which could adversely affect net sales and profits from international sales 
for fiscal years  and  revenue outside the united states represented approximately percent  percent and percent of our consolidated net sales  respectively 
our operations and earnings throughout the world have been and may in the future be adversely affected from time to time in varying degrees by war  political developments  foreign laws and regulations  regional economic uncertainty including the ongoing european debt crisis  political instability  restrictions  customs and tariffs  changing regulatory environments  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  longer accounts receivable cycles 
table of contents in certain foreign countries whether due to cultural  exchange rate or other factors  compliance with import export laws and foreign tax laws and potential increased costs associated with overlapping tax structures 
the likelihood of such occurrences and their overall effect on us vary greatly from country to country and are not predictable 
these factors may result in a decline in net sales or profitability and could adversely affect our ability to expand our business outside of the united states 
our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter  making it difficult to estimate future revenue and earnings 
our quarterly revenues and earnings have varied in the past and are likely to vary in the future 
contracts we enter into generally stipulate customer specific delivery terms and may have contract cycles of a year or more  which subjects them to many factors beyond our control 
furthermore  because significant portions of our operating costs are fixed  an unanticipated delay or cancellation of orders in backlog may have a significant negative impact on our quarterly operating results 
factors that could cause our operating results to vary also include new product introductions  variations in product and project mix  and delivery due date changes 
therefore  quarterly operating results may be subject to significant variations  and operating results in one quarter may not be indicative of future operating results 
our products are covered by warranties  and fulfilling these warranties could adversely affect our financial results 
unanticipated warranty and other costs for defective products could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and reputation 
we provide warranties on our products generally for terms of five years or less 
in addition  in response to customer needs  we regularly offer extended warranties 
these warranties require us to repair or replace faulty products and meet certain performance standards  among other customary warranty provisions 
although we continually monitor our warranty claims and provide a reserve for estimated warranty issues on an on going basis  an unanticipated claim could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
in some cases  we may be able to subrogate a claim back to a subcontractor or supplier if the subcontractor or supplier supplied the defective product or performed the service  but this may not always be possible 
the need to repair or replace products with design or manufacturing defects could temporarily delay the sale of new products  reduce profits and adversely affect our reputation 
product liability claims not covered by insurance could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we may be subject to product liability claims involving claims of personal injury or property damage 
although we maintain product liability insurance coverage to protect us in the event of such a claim  our coverage may not be adequate to cover the cost of defense and the potential award 
also  a well publicized actual or perceived problem could adversely affect our reputation and reduce the demand for our products 
large contracts with significant customers represent a significant portion of our accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings 
we closely monitor the credit worthiness of our customers and have not  to date  experienced significant credit losses 
significant portions of our sales are to customers who place large orders for custom products 
we mitigate our exposure to credit risk  to some extent  by requiring deposits  payments prior to shipment  progress payments and letters of credit 
however  because some of the exposure is outside of our control  unanticipated events could have a material adverse impact on our operating results 
the amounts of our orders and net sales and our financial results will be substantially affected by whether we are awarded large contracts and the size and timing of large contracts 
the amounts of our orders and net sales and our financial results will be substantially affected by whether we are awarded large contracts  primarily in the professional and major college sports facilities market  the outdoor advertising niche and for large spectaculars around the world and the amounts and timing of these contracts 
whether we are awarded large contracts and their timing and amount could also cause material fluctuations in our net sales and earnings 
awards of large contracts and their timing and amount are difficult to predict and are outside of our control 
the terms and conditions of our credit facility impose restrictions on our operations  and if we default on our credit facility  it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
the terms and conditions of our credit facilities impose restrictions that limit  among other things  our ability to incur debt  merge  sell assets  make distributions including cash dividends and create or incur liens 
the availability of credit facilities is also subject to certain covenants as explained in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to comply with the covenants may be affected by events beyond our control  and we cannot assure that we will achieve operating results and maintain a financial position meeting the requirements of the credit facility 
a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the facilities 
in the event of a default  the bank could elect to declare any outstanding principal amount of the credit facilities and term debt  any and all accrued interest thereon and any and all other amounts payable under the credit facilities to be immediately due and payable  which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
as of april   we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants of our credit facilities 
we must comply with the foreign corrupt practices act 
we are required to comply with the united states foreign corrupt practices act  which prohibits united states companies from engaging in bribery or making other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business 
it also requires us to maintain specific record keeping standards and adequate internal accounting controls 
foreign companies  including some of our competitors  are not subject to these prohibitions and requirements 
corruption  extortion  bribery  pay offs  theft and other fraudulent practices occur from time to time in many jurisdictions  
table of contents including the middle east and china 
if our competitors engage in these practices  they may receive preferential treatment from the personnel of some companies or governmental agencies  giving our competitors an advantage in securing business from these companies or from government officials who might give them priority in obtaining new licenses or permits  which would put us at a disadvantage 
in addition  although we inform our personnel through training sessions  policies and other means that such practices are illegal  we cannot assure that our employees or agents will not engage in such conduct for which we might be held responsible even if we are not aware of such conduct 
if our employees or agents are found to have engaged in such practices  we could suffer severe penalties 
our operations in the people s republic of china china subject us to risks and uncertainties relating to the laws and regulations of china 
we have offices and manufacturing facilities and make sales to customers in china which encompass many different activities 
under its current leadership  the government of china has been pursuing economic reform policies  including the encouragement of foreign trade and investment and greater economic decentralization 
however  the government of china may not continue to pursue such policies 
despite progress in developing its legal system  china does not have a comprehensive and highly developed system of laws  particularly with respect to foreign investment activities and foreign trade 
enforcement of existing and future laws and contracts is uncertain  and the implementation and interpretation of them may be inconsistent 
as the chinese legal system develops  the promulgation of new laws  changes to existing laws and the preemption of local regulations by national laws may adversely affect foreign investors and foreign companies with operations in china  such as ours 
in addition  some government policies and rules are not published or communicated in local districts in a timely manner  if they are published at all 
if they are published  they may not be followed consistently by local districts 
as a result  we may inadvertently operate our business in violation of new rules and policies without having any knowledge of their existence 
these uncertainties could limit the legal protections available to us 
any litigation in china may be protracted and result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention 
furthermore  a significant portion of our business in china involves contracts with government bodies which can significantly inhibit our ability to enforce a contract through litigation or similar means 
our ability to satisfy any debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic  financial and business conditions and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
it is anticipated that borrowings from our existing credit facilities and cash provided by operating activities should provide sufficient funds to finance our capital expenditures  working capital and otherwise meet operating expenses and debt service requirements as they become due 
however  if additional capital is required  there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise such capital when needed or on satisfactory terms  if at all 
we may make future acquisitions  which may be difficult to integrate  divert management resources  result in unanticipated costs or dilute our shareholders 
part of our business strategy is to make acquisitions of or investments in companies  businesses  products or technologies that complement our current products  enhance our market coverage or technical capabilities  or offer growth opportunities 
we currently do not have any definitive agreements to acquire any company or business  and we may not be able to identify or complete any acquisition in the future 
additional risks associated with acquisitions include the following it may be difficult to integrate the purchased company  products  businesses or technologies into our own business  we may incur substantial unanticipated integration costs  it may be difficult  time consuming and costly to integrate management information and accounting systems of an acquired business into our current systems  assimilating the acquired businesses may divert significant management attention and financial resources from our other operations and could disrupt our ongoing business  we may enter markets in which we have limited prior experience  acquisitions could result in the loss of key employees  particularly those of the acquired operations  we may have difficulty retaining or developing the acquired businesses customers  acquisitions could adversely affect our existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  we may fail to realize the potential cost savings or other financial benefits and or the anticipated strategic benefits of the acquisitions  and we may incur liabilities from the acquired businesses for infringement of intellectual property rights or other claims  and we may not be successful in seeking indemnification for such liabilities or claims 
in connection with these acquisitions or investments  we could incur debt  recognize amortization expenses related to intangible assets  recognize large and immediate write offs  assume liabilities  or issue stock that would dilute our current shareholders percentage of ownership 
we may not be able to complete acquisitions or integrate the operations  products or personnel gained through any such acquisition without a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our business is partially subject to risks of terrorist acts and  to a lesser degree  acts of war 
terrorist acts and  to a lesser degree  acts of war  may disrupt our operations as well as the operations of our customers 
such acts have created an interruption of orders and delays in orders already booked  primarily in sports facilities and destination sites 
any future terrorist activities and  to a lesser degree  acts of 
table of contents war  could create additional uncertainties  forcing customers to further reduce or delay their spending or cancel or delay already planned projects  which could have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results or financial condition 
our common stock has at times been thinly traded  which may result in low liquidity and price volatility 
the daily trading volume of our common stock has at times been relatively low 
if this were to occur in the future  the liquidity and appreciation of our common stock may not meet shareholders expectations  and the prices at which our stock trades may be volatile 
the market price of our common stock could be adversely impacted as a result of sales by existing shareholders of a large number of shares of common stock in the market or by the perception that such sales could occur 
we may fail to continue to attract  develop and retain key management and other key employees  which could negatively impact our operating results 
we depend on the performance of our senior management team and other key employees 
the loss of certain members of our senior management  including our chief executive officer  could negatively impact our operating results and ability to execute our business strategy 
our future success will also depend in part upon our ability to attract  train  motivate and retain qualified personnel 
we do not have employment agreements with the executive officers or other employees  but we do maintain key person life insurance on the lives of our chairman of the board and our chief executive officer 
we may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights 
we rely on a variety of intellectual property rights that we use in our products and services 
we may not be able to successfully preserve our intellectual property rights in the future  and these rights could be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries in which our products and services have been or may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
a failure to protect proprietary information and any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us could materially and adversely affect our competitive position 
in addition  even if we are successful in protecting our intellectual property rights or defending ourselves against a claim of infringement  any related dispute or litigation could be costly and time consuming and divert management s attention from business 
we may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights  which could be costly  time consuming and limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future 
as the sizes of our markets increase and our product offerings continue to evolve and become more sophisticated  we are more likely to be subject to claims that our technologies infringe upon the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of third parties 
given the current legal framework associated with infringement claims  any such claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming and expensive and could divert our management s attention away from the execution of our business plan 
moreover  any settlement or adverse judgment resulting from a claim could require us to pay substantial amounts  obtain a license to continue to use the technology that is the subject of the claim  or otherwise restrict or prohibit our use of the technology 
there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain a license from the third party asserting the claim on commercially reasonable terms  if at all  that we would be able to develop alternative technology on a timely basis  if at all  or that we would be able to obtain a license to use a suitable alternative technology to permit us to continue offering  and our customers to continue using  our affected product 
in addition  we may be required to indemnify our customers partners for third party intellectual property infringement claims  which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling in such a claim 
an adverse determination could also prevent us from offering our products to others 
infringement claims asserted against us or our vendors may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we maintain inventory that is subject to obsolescence and write downs to the extent it is replaced through product enhancements or advances in technology 
as a result of our products being subject to continuous enhancements and design changes  inventory held by us is subject to the risk of obsolescence and excess levels that may not be saleable 
losses incurred as a result could have an adverse impact on our future profits 
we may not be able to utilize our capacity efficiently or accurately plan our capacity requirements  which may negatively affect our business and operating results 
we increase our production capacity and the overhead that supports production based on anticipated market demand 
market demand  however  has not always developed as expected or remained at a consistent level 
the underutilization that can result decreases our profitability 
for example  in fiscal and  market demand for our products was increasing rapidly  resulting in expanding our capacity 
in the second half of fiscal  net sales were below our expectations 
this resulted in underutilization of our manufacturing capacity 
as a result  our profitability also was below our expectations 
the following factors complicate accurate capacity planning for market demand changes in the demand for and mix of products our customers buy  our ability to add and train our manufacturing staff in advance of demand  the market s pace of technological change  variability in our manufacturing productivity  and long lead times for most of our plant and equipment expenditures  requiring major financial commitments well in advance of actual production requirements 

table of contents a future deterioration of our business could result in further underutilization of our manufacturing capacity  resulting in an impairment of certain assets in the future 
our inability to plan our capacity requirements accurately and efficiently utilize our production capacity  or our failure to put in place the technologies and capacity necessary to meet market demand  could adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we depend on single source suppliers for some of the raw materials used in the manufacture of our products 
we obtain some of our raw materials  including  but not limited to  leds  power supplies  circuit boards and plastics  from a limited number of suppliers 
if we cannot obtain some key raw materials from our suppliers  the raw materials may not be readily available from other suppliers  other suppliers may not agree to supply the materials to us on terms that are as favorable as the terms we currently receive  or that the raw materials from any other suppliers may not be of adequate and consistent quality 
although we believe our supply of raw materials currently is adequate for the needs of our business  we cannot assure you that new sources of supply will be available when needed 
any interruption in our supply of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manufacture our products until a new source of supply is located and  therefore  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
new regulations related to conflict free minerals may force us to incur additional expenses 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of minerals originating from the conflict zones of the democratic republic of congo drc and adjoining countries 
as a result  the sec is required to establish new annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use conflict minerals mined from the drc and adjoining countries in their products 
when these new requirements are implemented  they could affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of our products 
as a result  we cannot ensure that we will be able to obtain minerals at competitive prices  and there may be additional costs associated with complying with the new due diligence procedures as required by the sec 
in addition  because our supply chain is complex  we may face reputation challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of all minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement 
general price increases or significant shortages of raw materials and components could adversely affect our operating margin 
we purchase large quantities of raw materials and components  including  but not limited to  aluminum  leds  power supplies  circuit boards and various other electronic components 
materials comprise the largest component of costs  representing nearly percent of the cost of sales in fiscal unless  to the extent described above  we have multiple sources of supply for many of our raw materials  significant shortages could disrupt the supply of raw materials 
further increases in the price of these raw materials and components could further increase our product costs and materially adversely affect margins 
although we attempt to pass along increased costs in the form of price increases to customers  we may decide not to do so for competitive reasons 
even when our price increases are successful  the timing of such price increases may lag significantly behind the incurrence of higher costs 
as of the date of this report  there were no material parts shortages in the market place that were impacting our business 
if our internal control over financial reporting is found to be inadequate  our financial results may not be accurate  raising concerns for investors and potentially adversely affecting our stock price 
under section of the sarbanes oxley act of  we are required to evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 
we have dedicated a significant amount of time and resources to ensure compliance with this legislation for the fiscal years ended april   april  and may  and will continue to do so for future periods 
we may encounter problems or delays in completing the review and evaluation  the implementation of improvements  and the receipt of a positive attestation  or any attestation at all  from our independent registered public accounting firm 
in addition  our assessment of our internal controls may identify deficiencies that need to be addressed in our internal controls over financial reporting or other matters that may raise concerns for investors and therefore adversely affect our stock price 
our manufacturing would be interrupted if we were unable to use one of our manufacturing facilities 
we manufacture most of our products in two locations in south dakota and one in minnesota 
in addition  we manufacture certain products in our china facility 
if any of these facilities  or a part thereof  were to be destroyed  shut down or unable to be used for its intended purposes  we would be limited in our capacity to meet customer demands until a replacement facility and equipment  if necessary  was found 
the replacement of the manufacturing facility could take an extended amount of time before manufacturing operations could restart 
the delay engendered by  and the potential cost incurred in  these steps could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the protections we have adopted may discourage takeover offers favored by our shareholders 
we have adopted  and there are available under the south dakota business corporation act sd act  several provisions that could have the effect of discouraging takeover offers 
of the  shares of capital stock authorized in our articles of incorporation   shares are undesignated 
our board of directors may issue the undesignated shares on terms and with the rights  preferences and designations determined by the board without shareholder action  which could be used to discourage takeover attempts 
our articles of incorporation provide for a classified board consisting of three classes of directors 
our classified board generally makes it more difficult to replace directors and to acquire our company 
we have adopted a shareholder rights plan that provides for the exercise of preferred share purchase rights when a person becomes the beneficial owner of percent or more of our outstanding common stock subject to certain exceptions 
in addition  we are governed by the anti takeover provisions of the current sd act  which may deny shareholders the receipt of a premium on their 
table of contents common stock  which in turn have a depressive effect on the market price of the common stock 
in general  shares of a corporation acquired in a control share acquisition  as defined in the sd act  have no rights unless voting rights are approved in a prescribed manner 
there are also provisions that prohibit a public south dakota corporation from engaging in a business combination  as defined in the sd act  with an interested shareholder  as defined in the sd act  for a period of four years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested shareholder unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner 
the sd act also limits the voting rights of shares acquired in specified types of acquisitions and restricts specified types of business combinations 
the existence or issuance of blank check stock  the classified board  the existence of our shareholder rights plan and the effect of the anti takeover provisions of the sd act  individually or in the aggregate  may discourage potential takeover attempts and delay  deter or prevent a change in control 
they also may make the removal of management more difficult  which could deprive our shareholders of opportunities to sell their shares at prices higher than prevailing market prices 
significant changes in the market price of our common stock could result in securities litigation claims against us 
significant price and value fluctuations have occurred with respect to the publicly traded securities of technology companies generally 
the price of our common stock has changed significantly in the past and is likely to continue to experience significant changes in the future 
in the past  securities litigation claims have been filed against certain companies following a period of decline in the market price of their publicly traded securities 
we may be the target of similar securities litigation claims in the future 
risks associated with litigation often are difficult to assess or quantify  and their existence and magnitude can remain unknown for significant periods of time 
although we maintain directors and officers insurance  the amount of insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover a claim  and the continued availability of this insurance cannot be assured 
future litigation  if any  may result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources  which could materially adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
difficult conditions in the capital  credit and commodities markets and in the overall economy could continue to materially adversely affect our financial position  results of operations and cash flow and those of our customers  and we do not know if these conditions will improve in the near future 
our financial position  results of operations and cash flow and those of our customers could continue to be materially adversely affected by the current and continuing difficult conditions and volatility in the capital  credit and commodities markets and in the overall worldwide economy 
these factors  combined with the prior declines in business and consumer confidence and higher unemployment  have precipitated a worldwide economic slowdown 
although these conditions appear to have improved  the continuing impact that these factors might have on us and our business is uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time 
current economic conditions have accentuated each of the risks described in this report and magnified their potential negative effect on us and our business 
the difficult conditions in these markets and the overall economy affect our business in a number of ways 
for example although we believe we have sufficient liquidity under our credit agreement with a bank to run our business  under extreme market conditions  there can be no assurance that such funds would be available or sufficient and  in such a case  we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms  or at all 
economic conditions  including the european debt crisis  could continue to result in our customers experiencing financial difficulties or electing to limit spending because of the declining economy and their inability to obtain credit  which may result in decreased net sales and earnings for us 
economic conditions combined with the weakness in the credit markets could continue to lead to increased price competition for our products  increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories and higher overhead costs as a percentage of revenue 
if the markets in which we participate experience further economic downturns  as well as a slow recovery period  this could continue to negatively impact our sales and revenue generation  margins and operating expenses  and consequently have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we do not know if market conditions or the state of the overall economy will improve or if any improvement will benefit our market 
circumstances could arise in which our goodwill and intangible assets could become impaired  causing us to recognize substantial non cash impairment charges  which would adversely affect our financial results 
we have pursued and will continue to seek potential acquisitions to complement and expand our existing businesses  increase our revenues and profitability  and expand our markets 
as a result of prior acquisitions  we have goodwill and intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report 
we will continue to evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our goodwill and intangible assets on an ongoing basis  and we may incur substantial non cash impairment charges  which would adversely affect our financial results 
there can be no assurance that the outcome of such reviews in the future will not result in substantial impairment charges 
impairment assessment inherently involves judgment as to assumptions about expected future cash flows and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions 
future events and changing market conditions may impact our assumptions as to prices  costs  holding periods or other factors that may result in changes in our estimates of future cash flows 
although we believe the assumptions we used in testing for impairment are reasonable  significant changes in any one of our assumptions could produce a significantly different result 
a decline in our market capitalization or in our estimated forecasted discounted cash flows also could result in an impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets 
a non cash impairment charge could materially and adversely affect the net income for the reporting period in which it is recorded

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in thousands  except per share data the following discussion highlights the principal factors affecting changes in our financial condition and results of operations 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements 
overview we design  manufacture and sell a wide range of display systems to customers throughout the world 
we focus our sales and marketing efforts on markets  geographical regions and products 
our primary five segments consist of four domestic segments and one international segment 
the four domestic segments consist of live events  commercial  schools and theatres  and transportation 
our net sales and profitability historically have fluctuated due to the impact of large product orders  such as display systems for professional sports facilities and colleges and universities  as well as the seasonality of the sports market 
net sales and gross profit percentages also have fluctuated due to other seasonality factors  including the impact of holidays  which primarily affects our third quarter 
our gross margins on large product orders tend to fluctuate more than those for smaller standard orders 
large product orders that involve competitive bidding and substantial subcontract work for product installation generally have lower gross margins 
although we follow the percentage of completion method of recognizing revenues for large custom orders  we nevertheless have experienced fluctuations in operating results and expect that our future results of operations will be subject to similar fluctuations 
orders are booked and included in backlog only upon receipt of a firm contract and after receipt of any required deposits 
as a result  certain orders for which we have received binding letters of intent or contracts will not be booked until all required contractual documents and deposits are received 
in addition  order bookings can vary significantly as a result of the timing of large orders 
general our business  especially the large video display business in all of our business units  is very competitive  and generally our margins on large video display contracts are similar across the business units over the long term 
there are  however  differences that arise in the short term among the business units  which are discussed more fully in the following analysis 
overall  our business growth is driven by the market demand for large format electronic displays and the depth and quality of our products  including related control systems  service offerings and our technology that serve these market demands 
this growth  however  is partially offset by declines in product prices caused by increasing competition as well as declines in the costs of the raw materials and improved product designs and manufacturing methods which decreases the per unit selling prices of displays 
within each business unit  there are also key growth drivers that apply uniquely to that business unit 
commercial business unit over the long term  we believe that the following factors are important growth drivers to our commercial business unit the continued deployment of digital billboards  which we believe can expand as billboard companies continue developing new sites for digital billboards and start to replace digital billboards which are reaching end of life  which we expect could start happening in fiscal this growth is dependent on there being no adverse changes in the digital billboard regulatory environment  which could restrict future deployments of billboards  as well as maintaining our current market share of the business that is concentrated in a few large billboard companies 
the growing interest in our standard display products that are used in many different retail type establishments among other types of applications 
the demand in this area is driven by on premise advertising through outdoor electronic display systems by retailers and other types of commercial establishments to attract motorists and others into their establishment  the establishments need to communicate messages to the general public  and in the future  increased demand from national accounts  including retailers  quick serve restaurants and other types of nationwide organizations 
increasing interest in spectaculars  which include very large  intricate displays seen at casinos  auto dealerships  amusement parks and times square type locations 
the introduction of architectural lighting products for commercial buildings  which real estate owners use to add accents or effects to an entire side or circumference of a building to communicate messages or to decorate the building 

table of contents live events business unit over the long term  we believe that growth in the live events business unit will result from a number of factors  including facilities spending more on larger display systems 
lower product costs  which are driving an expansion of the marketplace 
our product and services offerings  which remain the most integrated and comprehensive offerings in the industry 
the competitive nature of sports teams  which strive to out perform their competitors with display systems 
the desire for high definition video displays  which typically drives larger displays or higher resolution displays  both of which increase the average transaction size 
schools and theatres over the long term  we believe that growth in the schools and theatres business unit will result from a number of factors  including increasing demand for video systems in high schools  as school districts realize the revenue generating potential of these displays versus traditional scoreboards 
increasing demand for different types of displays  such as message centers at schools to communicate to students  parents and the broader community 
the use of more sophisticated display systems in less common venues  such as aquatic centers and track facilities 
transportation over the long term  we believe that growth in the transportation business unit will result from increasing applications of electronic displays in locations to manage an increasing number of commuters  including roadway  airport  parking  transit and other applications 
this growth is highly dependent on government spending  primarily federal government spending 
international over the long term  we believe that growth in the international business unit will result from achieving greater penetration in various geographies  building products more suited to individual markets  and the reasons listed in each of the other business units to the extent they apply outside the united states 
each of our business units is impacted by adverse economic conditions in different ways and to different degrees 
the effects of an adverse economy are generally less severe on our sports related business as compared to our other businesses  although in severe economic downturns  the sports business can be adversely impacted 
our commercial and international business units are highly dependent on economic conditions in general 
beginning in fiscal  we began to see the impacts of the economy negatively impact our commercial business unit and  to a lesser degree  our international business unit 
as we entered into fiscal  we began to see the adverse economic conditions impact the sports business in our live events and schools and theatres business units 
beginning in the second half of fiscal  we saw our commercial business unit start to rebound  led by improvements in orders for digital billboards  followed by improvements in other business units 
we are uncertain as to how much the current economic conditions are still impacting our business  but we believe that there are still adverse implications of the current economic conditions in all of our business units 
the cost and selling prices of our products have significantly decreased over time due to increased competition across all business units  lower component costs and product design changes 
they are expected to continue to decline in future years 
as a result  each year we must sell more products to generate the same level of net sales as in previous fiscal years 
critical accounting policies and estimates the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on a regular basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to estimated total costs on long term construction type contracts  costs to be incurred for product warranties and extended maintenance contracts  bad debts  excess and obsolete inventory  income taxes  share based compensation and contingencies 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition on long term construction type contracts 
earnings on construction type contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date to estimated total costs for each contract 
contract costs include all direct material and labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance 
indirect costs include charges for such items as facilities  engineering  and project management 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period 
table of contents in which such losses are capable of being estimated 
generally  construction type contracts we enter into have fixed prices established  and to the extent the actual costs to complete construction type contracts are higher than the amounts estimated as of the date of the financial statements  the resulting gross margin would be negatively affected in future quarters when we revise our estimates 
our practice is to revise estimates as soon as such changes in estimates are known 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in future estimates or assumptions we use to determine these estimates 
we combine contracts for accounting purposes when they are negotiated as a package with an overall profit margin objective  essentially represent an agreement to do a single project for a customer  involve interrelated construction activities  and are performed concurrently or sequentially 
when a group of contracts is combined  revenue and profit are earned uniformly over the performance of the combined projects 
we segment revenues in accordance with the contract segmenting criteria in accounting standards codification asc  construction type and production type contracts 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
to identify impairment in customers ability to pay  we review aging reports  contact customers in connection with collection efforts and review other available information 
although we consider our allowance for doubtful accounts adequate  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate and impair their ability to make payments to us  additional allowances may be required in future periods 
subsequent to april   we became aware of circumstances that could cause an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts in an amount between and million 
these circumstances arise out of a contract in china for which payment by our customer is dependent on funding from a local government entity that is not under any legal obligation to provide 
excluding this issue  we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine the allowance for doubtful accounts 
as of april  and april   we had an allowance for doubtful accounts balance of approximately million and million  respectively 
warranties 
we have recognized a reserve for warranties on our products equal to our estimate of the actual costs to be incurred in connection with our performance under the warranties 
generally  estimates are based on historical experience taking into account known or expected changes 
if we would become aware of an increase in our estimated warranty costs  additional reserves may become necessary  resulting in an increase in costs of goods sold 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine our reserve for warranties 
as of april  and april   we had approximately million and million reserved for these costs  respectively 
extended warranty and product maintenance 
we recognize deferred revenue related to separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance agreements 
the deferred revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual term 
if we would become aware of an increase in our estimated costs under these agreements in excess of our deferred revenue  additional reserves may be necessary  resulting in an increase in costs of goods sold 
in determining if additional reserves are necessary  we examine cost trends on the contracts and other information and compare that to the deferred revenue 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine estimated costs under these agreements 
as of april  and april   we had million and million of deferred revenue related to separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance agreements  respectively 
inventory 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
market refers to the current replacement cost  except that market may not exceed the net realizable value that is  the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion and disposal  and market is not less than the net realizable value reduced by an allowance for normal profit margins 
in valuing inventory  we estimate market value where it is believed to be the lower of cost or market  and any necessary changes are charged to costs of goods sold in the period in which they occur 
in determining market value  we review various factors such as current inventory levels  forecasted demand and technological obsolescence 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate the estimated market value of inventory 
however  if market conditions change  including changes in technology  product components used in our products or in expected sales  we may be exposed to unforeseen losses that could be material 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax expense  as well as assessing temporary differences in the treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these timing differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income in each jurisdiction  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
we review deferred tax assets  including net operating losses  and to the extent we believe that the asset may not be realized  we recognize a valuation allowance 
if our estimates of future taxable income are not met in future periods  a valuation allowance for some of these deferred tax assets may be required 
we believe that we will generate taxable income in future years which will allow for realization of deferred tax assets 
realization of the deferred tax assets would require approximately million of taxable income  which we believe is achievable through carry back of losses or future earnings 

table of contents we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions  both domestic and international  and are subject to audits in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  including challenges regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income amounts to various tax jurisdictions 
at any one time  multiple tax years are subject to audit by various tax authorities 
we record our income tax provision based on our knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances  including the existing tax laws  the status of any current examinations and our understanding of how the tax authorities view certain relevant industry and commercial matters 
in evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions  we record reserves for probable exposures consistent with asc  income taxes 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and fully resolved or clarified 
we adjust our income tax provision in the period in which actual results of a settlement with tax authorities differs from our established reserve  when the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position  or when more information becomes available 
our tax contingencies reserve contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the exposure associated with our various filing positions 
we believe that any potential tax assessments from various tax authorities that are not covered by our income tax provision will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flow 
we have not recorded us deferred income taxes on certain of our non us subsidiaries undistributed earnings  as such amounts are intended to be reinvested outside the united states indefinitely 
however  should we change our business and tax strategies in the future and decide to repatriate a portion of these earnings to one of our us subsidiaries  including cash maintained by these non us subsidiaries  additional non us tax liabilities would be incurred 
it is not practical at this time to estimate the amount of additional us tax liabilities we would incur 
some of the countries in which we are located allow tax holidays or provide other tax incentives to attract and retain business 
we have obtained holidays or other incentives where available and practicable 
our taxes could increase if certain tax holidays or incentives were retracted for past periods which in some cases could occur if we had not satisfied the conditions on which such holidays or incentives are based  they are not renewed upon expiration  or tax rates applicable to us in such jurisdictions are otherwise increased 
our tax holiday with respect to our chinese operations expired as of december  and as of april   we are not benefiting from any tax incentives in foreign jurisdictions which would have a material impact on our effective tax rate 
in addition  any acquisitions may cause our effective tax rate to increase  depending on the jurisdictions in which the acquired operations are located 
asset impairment 
carrying values of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed at least annually for possible impairment in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other 
our impairment review involves estimating of the fair value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets using a combination of a market approach and an income discounted cash flow approach at the reporting unit level that requires significant management judgment with respect to revenue and expense growth rates  changes in working capital  and the selection and use of an appropriate discount rate 
the estimates of fair value of reporting units are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment 
the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted future operating cash flows and could increase or decrease an impairment charge 
we use our judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual impairment tests 
indicators such as adverse business conditions  economic factors and technological change or competitive activities may signal that an asset has become impaired 
carrying values for long lived tangible assets and definite lived intangible assets  excluding goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  are reviewed for possible impairment as circumstances warrant in connection with asc  impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
impairment reviews are conducted when we believe that a change in circumstances in the business or external factors warrants a review 
circumstances such as the discontinuation of a product or product line  a sudden or consistent decline in the forecast for a product  changes in technology or in the way an asset is being used  a history of negative operating cash flow  or an adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  among others  may be indicators that trigger an impairment review 
the company s initial impairment review to determine if a potential impairment charge is required is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist 
the analysis requires judgment with respect to changes in technology  the continued success of product lines  future volume  revenue and expense growth rates  and discount rates 
share based compensation 
we use the black scholes standard option pricing model black scholes model to determine the fair value of stock options and stock purchase rights 
the determination of the fair value of the awards on the date of grant using the black scholes model is affected by our stock price as well as by assumptions regarding other variables  including projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate  expected volatility of our stock price in future periods  and expected dividend yield 
we analyze historical employee exercise and termination data to estimate the expected life assumption of a new employee option 
we believe that historical data currently represents the best estimate of the expected life of a new employee option 
the risk free interest rate we use is based on the us treasury zero coupon yield curve on the grant date for a maturity similar to the expected life of the options 
we estimate the expected volatility of our stock price in future periods by using the implied volatility in market traded options 
our decision to use expected volatility was based on the availability of actively traded options for our common stock and our assessment that expected volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than the historical volatility of our common stock 
we use an 
table of contents expected dividend yield consistent with our dividend yield over the period of time we have paid dividends in the black scholes option valuation model 
the amount of share based compensation expense we recognize during a period is based on the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
we estimate pre vesting option forfeitures at the time of grant by analyzing historical data  and we revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating share based compensation expense in future periods or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the expense in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our net earnings and net earnings per share in a future period

results of operations net sales year ended april  april  may  in thousands amount percent change amount percent change amount net sales commercial live events schools theatres transportation international orders commercial live events schools theatres transportation international fiscal year as compared to fiscal year commercial the increase in net sales in our commercial business unit for fiscal compared to fiscal is the net result of an increase in orders of approximately percent in our billboard business 
this growth was the result of the large outdoor advertising companies increasing their rollout of digital billboards beginning in calendar and our ability to gain back a portion of the business with one large outdoor advertising company 
an increase of approximately percent in orders for large video display systems  primarily spectaculars  which we attribute to improvements in the economy and a growing market 
a percent increase in orders for our standard product displays  which appears to be a reflection of improvement in the economy as well as our expanded product offerings  including our galaxypro line of displays 
live events net sales were generally flat in fiscal as compared to fiscal during fiscal  orders and net sales were impacted by a decrease in orders and net sales for professional baseball facilities 
during fiscal  we booked approximately million in orders for professional baseball projects compared to approximately million in net sales in professional baseball facilities were million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
these changes were the result of higher than expected orders in fiscal that were delayed from fiscal as a result of economic conditions  which drove to unusually high levels 
a decrease in orders and net sales for professional football and basketball facilities 
during fiscal  we booked approximately million in orders for professional football and basketball projects  compared to approximately million in fiscal 
table of contents net sales were million and million for fiscal and this change was the result of the labor issues in both sports in the spring and summer of calendar year an increase in orders for colleges and universities which more than offset the declines mentioned above 
this increase was the result of the factors driving growth in the live events business unit as described previously 
a number of factors  such as the discretionary nature of customers committing to upgrade systems  versus the non discretionary purchases associated with new construction  the current aggressive competitive environment and various other factors  make forecasting fiscal orders and net sales difficult 
however  for the reasons cited previously  we believe that over the long term  we expect to see this business unit grow  assuming that the economy continues to improve and we are successful at counteracting competitive pressures 
schools and theatres the decrease in net sales in our schools and theatres business unit for fiscal compared to fiscal is the result of economic pressures on schools  which we believe inhibits spending in spite of the revenue generation abilities of these display systems for schools 
a positive aspect that could drive growth in the schools and theatres business unit in the future is the increase in opportunities for larger video systems  primarily in high school facilities which benefit from our sports marketing services that generate advertising revenue to fund the display systems 
for the long term  we believe that this business unit presents growth opportunities as the economy improves 
transportation the increase in net sales in our transportation business unit for fiscal compared to fiscal is the result of the increase in orders booked during this period  which was driven by orders from the new jersey turnpike under a million  three year procurement contract 
net sales from this customer exceeded million for fiscal as a result of a large order booked in the first quarter of fiscal in excess of million and an award of a large procurement contract for more than million which is subject to contract negotiations and a minimum commitment of approximately million  we believe that net sales will increase significantly in fiscal as compared to fiscal international the increase in net sales in our international business unit for fiscal compared to fiscal is the result of the higher backlog of business we had at the beginning of fiscal  primarily as a result of a large contract for a new arena built in mexico during fiscal at the end of fiscal  the backlog of this contract was approximately million compared to zero at the end of fiscal we believe that although orders for this business unit have declined in fiscal  over the long term  this business unit represents a significant area of growth as we penetrate markets we have not focused on previously 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year commercial business unit 
net sales in our outdoor advertising business  which is a component of the commercial business unit  were up percent in fiscal as compared to fiscal orders in the outdoor advertising business were up approximately percent in fiscal compared to fiscal in addition to better economic conditions in fiscal compared to fiscal for outdoor advertisers  during the first quarter of fiscal  we were successful in earning back business from a large outdoor advertising company that had not placed significant orders with us during fiscal during the second quarter of fiscal  two of the large outdoor advertising companies in the united states announced their plans for an increase in digital billboard deployments beginning in the first calendar quarter of these plans  in addition to the improving economy benefiting other outdoor advertising companies  caused both orders and sales to rise 
we also believe that our ability to maintain our market share had been aided by the industry s acceptance of our series digital billboard product 
net sales in the reseller portion of the commercial business unit increased by approximately percent in fiscal compared to fiscal  while orders increased by approximately percent 
the increase in both orders and net sales was primarily driven by an increase in the large contract portion of this business  which includes spectaculars and other large video display systems 
the increase was also aided by the introduction of our architectural lighting products 
live events business unit 
the changes in net sales and orders for the live events business unit for fiscal as compared to fiscal was the result of a number of factors 
the most significant positive factor was the improvement in orders for professional baseball facilities 
we were awarded over million in contracts each exceeding million for major league baseball facilities during the second and third quarters of fiscal compared to none for the same periods in fiscal these baseball contracts  plus one additional contract booked in late fiscal  contributed over million in net sales in fiscal this increase from the baseball contracts was offset by a decline in large contracts over million in fiscal compared to fiscal net sales on contracts in excess of million declined from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decline is primarily due to the decreased number of new construction projects as discussed in prior filings 
schools and theatres business unit 
the changes in net sales in the schools and theatres business unit in fiscal compared to fiscal were the result of the sale of a higher number of custom video and scoring systems due to more opportunities created by our sports marketing business and the increased demand for large video systems  offset by declines in our standard scoreboard  display and hoist product sales 

table of contents transportation business unit 
the increase in net sales in the transportation business unit for fiscal was due to the reduction in backlog that existed at the beginning of the fiscal year  which was higher than normal 
orders were down slightly in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of a couple of unusually large orders booked in the second half of fiscal  including one order in excess of million for an east coast transit authority 
the decline in backlog resulted from improvements in our manufacturing throughput during late fiscal international business unit 
the increase in net sales in the international business unit during fiscal compared to fiscal was the result of the higher backlog at the beginning of fiscal as compared to the backlog at the beginning of fiscal and the increase in orders throughout fiscal included in orders in fiscal is a large project in excess of million for a new arena in mexico 
advertising revenues we occasionally sell products in exchange for the advertising revenues generated from the use of our display products 
these sales represented less than one percent of net sales for fiscal and the gross profit percent on these transactions has typically been higher than the gross profit percent on other transactions of similar size  although the selling expenses associated with these transactions are typically higher 
backlog the product order backlog as of april  was approximately million as compared to million as of april  historically  our backlog varies due to the timing of large orders and customer delivery schedules for these orders 
the backlog decreased from one year ago in our live events and schools and theatres business units and increased in our other business units 
backlog is not a measure defined by us generally accepted accounting principles  and our methodology for determining backlog may vary from the methodology used by other companies in determining their backlog amounts 
our backlog is equal to the amount of net sales expected to be recognized in future periods on standard product and contract sales that are evidenced by an arrangement  with prices that are fixed and determinable and with collectability reasonably assured 
backlog may not be indicative of future operating results  and arrangements in our backlog may be canceled  modified or otherwise altered  therefore  it is not necessarily indicative of future sales or net income

a decrease of approximately percentage points as a result of higher overhead costs associated with our services business 
an increase of approximately percentage points as a result of lower warranty expenses as a percentage of net sales 
for fiscal  warranty costs were approximately percent of net sales compared to percent in fiscal we have been challenged with increased levels of competitive pressures  by added costs of our services infrastructure as we deploy and reengineer systems and processes  and  to a lesser degree  higher than expected warranty costs 
in order to reduce warranty costs and to address competitive factors  we began expending significant effort on developing our new outdoor dvx technology in fiscal and then  in fiscal  on our new indoor dvn technology  which are common module platforms that have replaced many of the different and unique modules for each of our display resolutions and types 
part of this development also involves the markets increasing interest in higher resolution outdoor displays  which require surface mount technology as opposed to the traditional through hole technology 

table of contents the dvx and dvn technologies decrease the cost of displays significantly and supply the market with higher resolution products 
we have also invested significant resources in quality initiatives and reliability equipment to test new designs 
we believe that this technology and investment in quality initiatives will drive down warranty costs over the long term and make our products more competitive  both of which are intended to increase gross profit percentages and drive higher sales 
one of the challenges that occurred with the downturn of our business during fiscal was the higher percentage of fixed costs in manufacturing relative to net sales 
since the downturn  we have been lowering that percentage through cost reductions  lean initiatives and higher sales  and we expect to continue lowering it  adding to the gross profit percentages 
total manufacturing conversion costs for fiscal and fiscal were approximately million and million  respectively 
these conversion costs represented percent and percent of sales for fiscal and  respectively 
it is difficult to project gross profit levels for fiscal because of the uncertainty regarding the level of sales  and the competitive factors described previously  although we expect that gross profit levels will increase as we improve utilization of our services organization and we continue to decrease warranty expenses as a percentage of sales 
this assumes that competitive pressures remain consistent with the levels of fiscal commercial the gross profit percent increase in the commercial business unit for fiscal compared to fiscal is the net result of a decrease in warranty expenses  which added approximately percentage points to gross profit percentage and resulted from the actions previously discussed and some unusually higher costs in fiscal  as explained in prior filings 
a decrease in gross profit percentage on services and maintenance agreements  which caused a decrease of approximately percentage points 
a decrease in the gross profit on product sales that decreased gross profit percentage by approximately percentage points  primarily due to an increased percentage of net sales in the billboard niche  which typically has lower gross profit percentages

an increase in our services overhead  which reduced the gross profit percentage by approximately percentage points 

table of contents international the gross profit percent decrease in the international business unit for fiscal compared to fiscal is the net result of a decrease in the gross margin on product sales  which decreased the overall gross profit by approximately percentage points 
this decrease is the result of a number of factors  including added costs to conform products to local regulatory requirements and a lower margin on contracts booked due to the factors described below 
an increase in warranty costs  which added approximately percentage points 
an increase in manufacturing costs  primarily in china as we increased the capabilities there 
historically  our gross margins in the international business unit have generally been higher than in our other business units as a result of the focus on more profitable contracts  as we have limited penetration in international markets 
in prior quarters  we stated that the gross margin levels in our international business unit were not sustainable as we penetrated more deeply in international markets and competition increased 
we are now beginning to recognize lower gross margins in our international business unit due to these factors 
the recent declines in gross profit percentage in the international business unit reflect our deeper penetration and our success with larger international customers  typically resulting in lower gross margins due to the customers potential volume and more intense competition 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the increase in gross profit in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to higher net sales 
the increase in gross profit as a percent of sales is the result of an improved gross profit on our services business and a lower conversion cost of manufacturing as a percentage of sales  which were partially offset by a decrease of approximately two percentage points in gross profit on product sales  primarily large contract sales  and higher warranty costs as a percentage of net sales 
the decline in large contract gross profit percentage was primarily due to the competitive factors described above 
gross profit percentages were relatively flat in fiscal and fiscal on small contract sales 
large contracts were approximately percent of net sales in fiscal  compared to approximately percent in fiscal warranty costs were approximately percent of net sales for fiscal and percent of net sales in fiscal within the commercial business unit  the gross profit percentage increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal as a result of an improved margin on services related sales  which added approximately one percentage point to gross profit and improved manufacturing conversion costs  as described previously 
this increase was partially offset by higher warranty costs  which caused a one half of a percentage point decline in gross profit percentage 
gross profit percentage in the live events business unit decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal as a result of lower margins on large contracts  which caused the gross profit percent to decline by approximately four percentage points  partially offset by improvements in manufacturing conversion costs and an improvement in gross profit percent on services 
the lower gross profit percent on contracts is attributable to the competitive factors described above 
gross profit percentage in the schools and theatres business unit increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal as a result of improvements in manufacturing conversion costs as a percent of sales  which were partially offset by lower gross profit percents on equipment sales in the sports portion of this business unit 
gross profit percentage in our transportation business unit increased in fiscal compared to fiscal by approximately three percentage points as a result of the improvement in manufacturing conversion costs as previously described 
within the international business unit  the gross profit percentage increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal as a result of an improvement in manufacturing conversion costs as previously described

international the increase in selling expenses for fiscal compared to fiscal was the result of a million increase in payroll costs  net of taxes and benefits  which were offset by cost savings in various other expenses 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year selling expense decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal as a result of a decrease in personnel costs  including taxes and benefits  of approximately million  a decrease of million in depreciation  and a million decrease in bad debt expense 
these savings were offset by increases of million in travel and entertainment costs  a million increase in costs of conventions  a million increase in commission and consultants  and an increase in other costs of million 
the decrease in personnel costs was the result of the lower number of employees caused by the reduction efforts explained above and decreases in benefits due to a change in health insurance plans 
the increase in travel and entertainment costs was a reflection of the higher level of sales opportunities and costs of conventions 
the decline in bad debt expense in fiscal was due to two larger isolated reserves established in fiscal the increase in costs of conventions was a result of higher costs incurred on trade shows attended

investments in our dvx and dvn technology platform  architectural lighting products  various other initiatives to standardize display components and in other display technologies and related items  including control systems for both single site displays and networked displays  continue to drive product design and development expenses 
our costs for product development represent an allocated amount of costs based on time charges  materials costs and overhead of our engineering departments 
generally  a significant portion of our engineering time is spent on product development  while the rest is allocated to large contract work and included in cost of goods sold 
the increase in product development expense in fiscal as compared to fiscal is the net result of the allocation of the following changes in our engineering department total spending and other charges made directly to product development initiatives an increase in personnel costs  including taxes and benefits  of approximately million  as we increased our staff to support the continued roll out of our display and control system platforms 
an increase in material costs related to product development of million as a result of increasing importance placed on prototyping new products and the increase in new product introductions

overall  we expect that product design and development expenses will increase slightly in fiscal as compared to fiscal  although our goal is to continue to challenge our cost structure until our operating margin returns to more reasonable levels 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year general and administrative expenses decreased as a result of approximately million in personnel costs  including benefits and taxes  lower costs related to hardware and software infrastructure  including depreciation  which decreased million  and lower professional fees  which decreased by approximately million 
the decreases were offset by an increase of million in computer software  hardware  and maintenance costs 
the lower level of personnel costs was the result of the reductions in employees in prior years as described above

the proceeds from the insurance company were used to purchase replacement equipment  inventory and supplies and offset the extra expense of outsourcing this manufacturing and building out a new facility to house the operations 
goodwill impairment during the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million related to our schools and theatres and international business units 
the charge was approximately million for each business unit 
there was no similar impairment expense in prior fiscal years 
the impairment resulted from our analysis of goodwill  which factored in the unexpected decline in forecasted discounted cash flows

interest expense is comprised primarily of interest costs on long term marketing obligations 
interest income declined slightly for fiscal as compared to fiscal due to a reduction in our cash and short term investment balances that was mainly the result of dividends paid during fiscal as a result of the volatility of working capital needs and changes in investing and financing activities  along with changes in the interest rate environment  it is difficult to project changes in interest income 
we expect that our cash balances will be increasing during fiscal  however  we are unable to project how that will compare to fiscal interest expense increased to million for fiscal as a result of borrowings in china to support our expanding business there and the impact of currency controls  which limit our transfers of investment capital from the us to fund operations in china 
we expect that interest expense will remain at relatively low levels for fiscal other expense income  net the decrease of million for fiscal as compared to fiscal is due to the net result of a million gain on the settlement of amounts owed by outcast media international  inc in fiscal  as described in previous filings  an increase of million in foreign currency losses  and various other non operating gains

table of contents in comparing fiscal to fiscal  changes in the effective tax rate is due to the net impact of the following items a decrease in the in the effective tax rate of approximately percentage points as a result of the deductibility of dividends paid into our k in fiscal which were not deductible in fiscal due to a change in plan design 
an increase in the effective tax rate of approximately percentage points as a result of the lower level of deduction for domestic production activities which result from the lower level of income before taxes 
a decrease in the effective rate of approximately percentage points as a result of the impact of the research and development tax credit compared to income before taxes 
an increase in the liability for foreign income taxable in the united states under subpart f of the internal revenue code of  which increased the effective tax rate by percentage points 
a decrease in the effective tax rate of approximately percentage points as a result of the impact on the deferred tax expense in a foreign jurisdiction as a result of the expiration of the termination of a tax holiday 
various other items which have a greater impact on the effective rate due to lower income before taxes but are not material to the results 
we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions  both domestic and international  and are subject to audits in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  including challenges regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income amounts to various tax jurisdictions 
at any one time  multiple tax years are subject to audit by various tax authorities as different taxing jurisdictions have different statutes of limitations 
the united states internal revenue service irs is currently in the process of examining our us federal tax returns for fiscal years and this audit is substantially complete and we believe that it will result in a net refund of approximately million 
the chinese tax authorities recently completed an audit of our tax returns for calendar years prior to in connection with a transfer of location of our business address in china  which did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year income tax expense benefit increased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the increase was attributable primarily to the increase in income before income taxes and an increase in the effective tax rate 
the effective rate for fiscal was an expense of approximately percent as compared to a benefit of percent in fiscal included in income tax expense for fiscal was the impact of the reinstatement of the research and development tax credit  which was signed by the president in late calendar year this reduced our income tax expense by approximately million  as the reinstatement was retroactive to january  had this benefit not been recognized  our effective tax rate would have been approximately percent for fiscal in addition  as a result of the operating losses in fiscal  we were not entitled to the benefit of the domestic production activities deduction 
which caused a reduction in the effective rate of approximately three percentage points in fiscal in addition to the foregoing factors  the effective tax rate varied from fiscal to as a result of the mix of pre tax income in different countries 
furthermore  the rate was impacted by the magnitude of permanent adjustments compared to income before income taxes 
in fiscal  these permanent differences  which are generally consistent in amount from year to year  had a greater impact on the effective rate than they did in fiscal when income before taxes was higher 
fiscal year fourth quarter summary during the fourth quarter of fiscal  net sales decreased percent to million as compared to million in the fourth quarter of fiscal the decrease was primarily due to decreased net sales in the live events  transportation  and international business units  which was partially offset by an increase in net sales in the commercial business unit 
the decline in live events resulted primarily from the decrease in net sales from professional baseball opportunities as explained previously 
the decline in sales in the international business unit  was the result of orders being delayed and getting pushed out into fiscal year the decline in the transportation business unit was the result of timing on customer orders and related delivery expectations 
the increase in the commercial business unit was the result of increased orders for large video systems  primarily from orders placed prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal gross margin percentage decreased to percent in the fourth quarter of fiscal from percent in the fourth quarter of fiscal the decrease in gross profit percentage was the net result of a decrease of approximately percentage points in product sales  primarily due a percentage point impact of cost overruns on projects in our live events business unit and competitive pressures driving down gross profit in our commercial business unit

cash flows from investing activities the decrease in cash used in investing activities for fiscal as compared to fiscal was the result of the net effect of the following a decrease in the net cash invested in marketable securities  net of maturities 
we began investing excess cash in marketable securities in fiscal and have generally maintained that level of investment during fiscal to the extent that maturities exceeded purchases in fiscal  it resulted from lags in reinvesting the funds 
an increase in purchases of property and equipment of approximately million 
during fiscal  we invested in manufacturing equipment  million in product demonstration equipment  million in information systems infrastructure  including software  and million in other assets 
these investments were generally for maintenance in the case of information systems and in manufacturing related to the expansion of capability in china and in improving flexibility in our plants as it relates to new products

working capital was million at april  and million at april  we have historically financed working capital needs through a combination of cash flow from operations and borrowings under bank credit agreements 
we have used and expect to continue to use cash reserves and  to a lesser extent and primarily in china  bank borrowings to meet our short term working capital requirements 
on large product orders  the time between order acceptance and project completion may extend up to and exceed months depending on the amount of custom work and the customer s delivery needs 
we often receive down payments or progress payments on these product orders 
to the extent that these payments are not sufficient to fund the costs and other expenses associated with these orders  we use working capital and bank borrowings to finance these cash requirements 
our product development activities during fiscal included the enhancement of existing products and control systems and the development of new products from existing technologies  including new architectural lighting applications 
product design and development expenses were million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal we expect to incur expenditures at a higher rate than our long term targeted level of four percent of net sales for fiscal to develop new display products and solutions that will offer higher resolution and more cost effective and energy efficient displays  as well as control systems that are provided with the displays 
we intend to continue developing software applications related to our display systems to enable these products to continue to meet the needs and expectations of the marketplace 
we have a credit agreement with a us bank that provides for a million line of credit and includes up to million for standby letters of credit 
the line of credit is due on november  the interest rate ranges from libor plus basis points to libor plus basis points depending on the ratio of interest bearing debt to ebitda 
ebitda is defined as net income before income taxes  interest expense  depreciation and amortization 
the effective interest rate was percent at april  we are assessed a loan fee equal to percent per annum of any non used portion of the loan 
as of april   there were no advances under the line of credit

the facility provides for a million line of credit and includes facilities to issue up to million for letters of credit and bank guarantees and to secure foreign loans 
this us credit facility secured the credit facility that we entered into in china with a chinese affiliate of the us bank 
it is also expected to secure another facility in europe to be used to issue credit enhancements as required under our contracts with our customers 
the us credit agreement is unsecured and is cross collateralized with the million line of credit described above 
it contains the same covenants as the credit agreement for that line of credit

we anticipate that we will be able to obtain any needed funds under commercially reasonable terms from our current lenders or other sources 
we believe that our working capital available from all sources will be adequate to meet the cash requirements of our operations in the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we enter into various debt  lease  purchase and marketing obligations that require payments in future periods 
debt obligations represent primarily bank loans 
operating lease obligations relate primarily to leased manufacturing space  office space  furniture  and vehicles 
long term marketing obligations relate to amounts due in future periods for payments on net sales where we sold and installed our equipment in exchange for future advertising revenue 
when certain advertising revenue thresholds are met  all or a portion of excess cash is owed back to the customer 
unconditional purchase obligations represent future payments for inventory and advertising rights purchase commitments 
guarantees include a transaction in connection with the sale of equipment to a financial institution 
under this transaction  we entered into a contractual arrangement whereby we agreed to repurchase equipment at the end of the lease term at a fixed price of approximately million 
we have recognized a guarantee in the amount of million under the provisions of asc  guarantees

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange rates through april   most of our net sales were denominated in united states dollars  and our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate changes on net sales has not been significant 
net sales originating outside the united states for fiscal were approximately percent of net sales  of which a portion was denominated in canadian dollars  euros  chinese renminbi  british pounds  australian dollars  brazilian reais or other currencies 
if we believed that currency risk in any foreign location was significant  we would utilize foreign exchange hedging contracts to manage our exposure to the currency fluctuations 
over the long term  net sales to international markets are expected to increase as a percentage of net sales and  consequently  a greater portion of this business could be denominated in foreign currencies 
in addition  we fund our foreign subsidiaries operating cash needs in the form of loans denominated in us dollars 
as a result  operating results may become subject to fluctuations based upon changes in the exchange rates of certain currencies in relation to the united states dollar 
to the extent that we engage in international sales denominated in us dollars  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets 
this effect is also impacted by the sources of raw materials from international sources 
we will continue to monitor and minimize our exposure to currency fluctuations and  when appropriate  use financial hedging techniques  including foreign currency forward contracts and options  to minimize the effect of these fluctuations
